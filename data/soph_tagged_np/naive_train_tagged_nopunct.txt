it was my thirteenth birthday
i was so happy it was finally here
mostly everyone does the same
from school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there
i remember every other day someone would go home crying
you can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about
<caps> was nice to wait till i was ready to go on
i had got irritated at her for constantly ditching out on our plans we had together to go spend time with her boyfriend
studies show that <percent> of people with computers have either <caps> or <organization> installed in their computers
another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world
if the libraries took off all material that offended people there would be nothing left
another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast
many times i have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work
people are different and they will thank different things
his eyes closed as the wind began to calm
its especially helpful for work because instead of calling a bunch of clients
workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing
she started screaming at me saying what happen was i fighting stuff like that
he was also had enough patience to wait to see what was wrong
i had <caps> friends yet and i was to shy to go and join any of the groups so i walked to all of my classes alone
there are also freedoms in the <location> that grant us freedom of speech
my mom means the world to me just as i mean the world to her
many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands
it was a short and slender beach
not only do people interact bu people can research useful information
do not even think about
when you are on the computer
the dessert is very hot
not in the house on the computer
<caps> we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building i asked if they needed any help with the play
my brother and i checked out the house and walked up and down the streets
this topic is just too abstract to be regulated
there are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story
these are questions i kept asking myself
my parent got rid of our books a wile ago because of computers
everyone including me started laugh because i fell in the mud and got all dirty
the author created a lively mood filled with love and gratefulness for his parents
we all want our kids to be happy
the idea was dangerous
my river of tears stopped and i began to speak
the dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever
the reason we did this is because we would walk by his house everyday and he would turn on his sprinkler and this annoying alarm thing
thats why censorship is good in a public place like a library
and it also made her believe in herself and want to get there and try again
the builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below
one reason i feel this way is by the way he talks about what goes on in his home
people could assume that drugs kill you
it was fuzzy thick and warm with a huge tiger on it
someone could really like it or a group of people could
then you buy it or sell it
then i asked him after lunch and he said yes
that was a time i was patient
the common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please
well having a computer allows this to happen
what the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work
in the <num> grade <caps> person was split into a group
it time when i was patience was when i went to a pair and we had to wait in line for like two hours
this idea proved to be very challenging
ill admit those words really dried my tears up
unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up
computers open you up met new friends
about half way through the <num> paragraph was when the memoir started to get very <caps>
it was really trashy
there where a computer can help you
censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from
<person> was about to blow at <time> knew he would never forgot this moment
one thing that they taught me is having <caps> is a gift and a curse
this would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty
in the memoir the author made a certain mood
most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines
with this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support
we sat down again and we waited
but his determination led to success and arrived into a town
after a terrible loss <person> came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents
if we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad
bringing a storm of swearing and profane language
<location> is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body
the height of the building was a major problem for the architects
as he pedal on the sun was beginning to beat down but i barely noticed it
she had gotten a lot of clothes from people
<caps> hard to stop all that
there are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can
it has a big effect on a humans life
well to begin my persuasive <caps>
the main mood he created was thankfulness
dirigibles is an old word for blimps
i was one round away from going to state automatically
its disrespectful to take time away from your friends to play on computers
recently the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention
most people that have computers can use them for emailing friends
this is an experience i will never forget
censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people
ill put that into more details in my next paragraph
as i read i noticed the building never fulfilled its purpose
are some good reasons why computers are good and help you
the story i just read was inspiring
i cant have that i was patient for so long for clothes
some movies have scenes that are horrible and that should be in the adult section
the trophy was rightfully his any ways
they were scared that weighing the ship down with lead weights would be dangerous because of all the people below in the city
they also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often
this had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right
they hypnotize the young children and adults
the doctor put a tube on my mouth and said close your eyes and breath
then it was really quite and <person> farted and we all started to laugh again
our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech
the bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died
you should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at
i think laughing is the best medicine for a person
and learn about all the cooking
the computer is not <caps> used for just communication
we have been through many fights but every time i think about that day in the locker room i cant help but to laugh
give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to
there were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast
i think she is really smart
the authors mood that is created in the memoir is love and gratitude
we poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing
opposing ideas should be presented
from my experience i have seen people complain about these things
i got board so i just fell asleep
<caps> would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time
lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my papas backyard that day
the last thing that i am going to talk about is how i feel on censorship in libraries
it is his most favorite place in the whole world and that is why he talks about his home in great detail
and then describes how harsh winds could render the mast unstable
these materials can be found helpful to others
were going to see your grandparents for a few hours
this is only going to happen if you interact face to face with them
one obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city
my friends sneered at one another
when you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play
tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
as <caps> stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice <caps> got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was fun
the second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps
another factor that contributed to the danger was that dirigibles are highly flammable due to the hydrogen which made most of them stay afloat then
or new <caps> shows and music all be find
i can do this because at night when one one can go outside i go on the computer for school or for fun
this is terrible and should stop going on
he or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book
as they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark
life without laughter is like life without water
her mom seems to be bothered by every action or choice of her daughters
as we were walking down the snowy hill <caps> spotted the <num> pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it
we ended up not finishing the game because it was way to funny
these are two of the challenges builders faced is constructing the empire state building
he knew he had to be patient
this is the mood that i think this author created
the computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with <caps> opinion
any one has the right to anything
then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy
today more than <percent> of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer
i have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list
these are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph
it was a bigger drop from the mattress to the stairs than i thought it would be
because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand
this is a tamed plant for the family
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
showing a bad example for the child
sometimes its not <organization> but its finding things
people seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them
so the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort
i already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier
she looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad
this emphasizes the characters total lack of resources
one example is because he said they where all family to them
all of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful
the <caps> used it in the <caps> colonies during the <caps> <caps> to keep the colonists loyal to the crown
one obstacle faced with the construction of the <organization> was the location
we lay there talking as we waited for the movie to start
also there is a robot used that digs out mines which saves many lives
then when it got dark we decided to go home and were still cracking jokes
times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an appropriate option
the problem with censorship is that a <caps> could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves
the last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas
kids are maturing at a much younger age these days
they are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time
she said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to
then i rode rides the rest of the <time>
if the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians
finally why i believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life
they make the most money off of them
hand eye coordination is very important
people losing time to have fun
there is so many stores to choose from but <time> one will be the most fun to tell i think
everyone is offended by something
many people have different views on censorship
a time when i was patient was actually a few days ago
part of what makes <location> so great is the freedom that come with living here
different crowds of people have different interests that <month> offend others
i would say that because he always has something nice to say
his favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age
i would think that the architects would have considered all these factors before trying to begin the project
the major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area
people need to know the true meaning of what is being said
i live in the <organization>
well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out
they would be dangling high above pedestrians
one day <caps> i went to class there was a project due and kid said i copy all of the words for the computers
other countries ships could set on fire in the united states and put people in danger
there are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist
there was something about her that nobody knew about
there was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier
now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing
i cant complain or i will get in trouble i just have to be patient
keep this in mind as one of the many great things about the computer
also provides education
this proves proves how much difficulty the builders were going to have with the construction of the empire state building
<num> out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them
there are scary books like <caps> <caps>
on time it might take your just over a minute
the author found a bait shop and got water
i would like to no how some of these people come up with this at
back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter
i knocked on his door
i believe she uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home
but i cant really blame them
books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library
also we all got <num> players
instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on <caps> you can make a decision simply to <caps> watch that kind of show
they help adults stay in contact with their friends
overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life
i watched them before though
it was here were i learned the real definition of family
that was the question that kept me wondering
they will get many facts about that place
the author mentions endless celebrations
he does this because he is so thankful to his parents because he loves them
so in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him
we went to the funeral that <date> and when it was all done i sat in <caps> room and only could remember all the laughs we shared
the material we read in books are sometimes offensive
all of those are the reasons why i think the computer has good effects
so the idea of her eyes hurting from laughing really hard is just uncontrollably funny
i believe censorship should be illegal not required
after she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change
when i was about nine years old
today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive
you could be in a depression stage and either a friend or a family member could walk up to you and pacify you and make you laugh
then the libraries movie business would be over
that was the mood created by the author in the <caps>
laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people
this would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the empire state building
another example is a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
lucky for them mom was in a very good mood or they would have got <caps>
while i was in middle school every day i would have a book with me to read
todays books that condone violence have guns drugs and sexual content on the front cover making it hard for a child not to want to read it
but could it be a bad thing
you can quickly open <caps>
the cyclist runs into some pretty tough challenges
sections in libraries organizes the library providing and easier access to where things are located
the third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion
i feel that the people at the library are lazy personally
after i got changed i got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it
the authors mood is very grateful and happy
sometimes its not always up to them
it told me <location> was located in <location>
that are not appropriate for children
when you are driving you need to be able to look up and still be able to steer the car
they had open dinner where friends and family members came
there are so many helpful things to use it for
the law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
the author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again
i had an <caps> appointment
for example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use
they could be offensive to some but to others only educational
i really wanted to go on t the next part because i had so much time left and nothing to do
my parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people
a final obstacle faced was nature itself
they put <money> of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building
now lets say the wiring in your lights get messed up
<caps> ever we got bored we usually went around <caps> neighborhood <caps> <caps> <caps> some houses to have some fun
laughter is the most important part when you meet other people
in conclusion i think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library
with a lot of thing like my teacher gave my class some homework and we had to find facts about <caps> <caps> the <num>
i think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test
the boy soldiers were walking towards her
i was less a foreigner and more a new friend
<person> had made a mistake
they are very mysterious when it comes to that
it distracts people from their life
with computer you can look up available homes and apartments
we were both excited because <caps> dad would be the only one there
i guess the lesson learned here is that before you preheat the over you should always make sure nothing is in there
getting more exercise could help you out in a big way because the less exercise you get means the less healthier you are
the ball redirected into the goal my team started to cheer we were up <num>
not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more
if you will please continue on i would like to share with you my thoughts
i certainly cant imagine life without laughter
these are key factors that show us that you can have fun on computers and still have time for family and friends
we were all laughing <caps> hard we started crying
learning and studying new and important things
by keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she came from
the other practical problem builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas
it should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out
i picked it up and give it to the clerk to scan
another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too
for an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go
most of the questioning about a book is the language in it
also when your bored it will give you something to do
but not the land has changed and the directions were wrong
i was choking on my words as i talk to my best friend <person>
then i went in for <caps>
they are all happy because they can be together and have a grate time
setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclists physical and mental state
this made them rush and really <caps> for this
they came selflessly
my name is <caps> and i have a very hipper non patience horse named <caps>
another problem that they were faced with was that it was <caps> too dangerous
i know this because in paragraph <num> he says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the she had to go some were else she took <num> hours in there
if you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family
i hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives
you <caps> need to try your hardest to be patient
be a person who you love in addition be every thing you can be
the sub came and stood there by us and we all got quit and then started laughing again
also the narrator compares her to the geese returning
this shows her family is kind and loving
the authors parents let people stay in their home so that they could get back on their feet
why would they be up there in the first place what is this world coming to
i had to be patient and wait till his head went down so i could stand up and shoot it
lastly you can plan your trip
in our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere
the author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
one day he came to my home and we were talking and he held my hands and proposed me
the funny part of this trip was when we were trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us
that was a time i had patience and regret it
libraries are often thought of as a room full of books inside a school building
by now i was laughing so hard i could hardly breath and my face was turning into a shade of purple
i will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor
me personally am faster at than writing
i got him mounted and thats were he is now
there was no racism within their neighborhood
that is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip
he or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable
they are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits mankind today
its something that makes a relationship last
lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is
we drove to the hospital and they did xrays
we had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other
the next day i kept seeing these commercials of the phone i wanted
so when she goes to take the test it will be a <caps> year
there are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions
you can not disagree
people should wont to get out and interact
the effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing
i was doing a water depleting 12 mph this lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried
and thats a time when i was patient
there were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality
being on the computer constantly can ruins your life
they thought the same
how can your music get banned in the land of the free
<person> and i started talking about how that joke was only funny because it was so dang stupid
typing skills are needed by almost everyone in the world
the features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink
said <caps> dad as we walked to the line
everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things
the words that weave this wellwritten memoir are nothing if not content
so then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer
i thought about that phone for weeks
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
what i saw when i looked at her was her eyes meet mine
libraries have books that spark interest in a reader
now a days you can do anything on a computer
so we sat around till all of they were open
the coach was there to recruit players for his <caps> team
<caps> cousin lives in <location> and the only way i can ever talk to him is through a computer
a time when i was patient was when we were leaving on vacation
they need water to survive especially during their long bike ride
that is why computers are so positive
for years now people have wanted books that are read in school to be censored for bad language
what kids read is shaping their minds for their future
its healthy and good in any relationship
i could have pretended i was sick and went home but i decided to just calm down and be patient
that day i experienced more laughter then ever before his jokes where original and true
this quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water
people should have a minimal amount of time of <num> minutes each day and then get some exercise
thats the kind of stuff that really upsets me
in the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test
that is what i think about laughter
nothing stood in our way when we laughed
without a doubt using a computer helps us learn
that day i learned patience is a way of life people have to live with and this is the time i had to live with it
the reason i think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland
but theres also a down side
these machines get our messages and vices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds
we had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in <location>
so my friend <person> decided in watch movies on the <caps>
instead of sitting at the computer all <date> people should be out getting exercise
<caps> workers should have considered possible obstacles before building something as big a project as a mooring mast
on television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff
after consulting with the navy as well as meeting with the president of newly formed airship transport company
he found me and shot me i fell out of the tree and broke my gun
i was doing a water depleting <num>
my next argument against computers <caps> about our bodies and minds
another obstacle was nature
this is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many many different kinds of books
many obstacles were faced by the builders of the empire state building as stated in the article the mooring mast by <organization>
eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea
i am always patient with people
and a lot has to do with the kidnapping
when we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking
they had to design it so the building could bear the stress of the dirigible
i have been involved in a lot of social groups
i had to be patient to <num> hours before me and my family arrived
you can even fill out a job application right then and there
it could be a section that kids could not enter
teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy
the other was just a car bolt
the whole day i was waiting for it to be <num> so i could go to her house
something told me to keep this from <caps> dad
but then my dad said he was going to help me <caps> he told me to be patient
it also can have people talk to their family member from a other country through a webcam
the empire state building was equipped for transportation
it was unrealistic because this was never done before on top of a building
i had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school
they help us in a lot of way and they also help us find new friends and new updates
<person> decided to roll his window down and started ordering stuff for himself at the same time his grandma was
soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him
lastly dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
i used it to wait for my baby cousin <caps> to be born
for example in many libraries around the <caps>
but those books about war are probably books about history
the greatest issue was nature
people will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong
thats something we have to take in and suck it up
i would only go on for a little bit to talk to your friends
this would keep blimps from landing there
with high speed air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast
by the very dry climates
what made it better was that she still came over all the time
does <caps> make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone
these are the things you should have
computers also are very addicting
being on the computer takes a lot out on the body
<caps> true you are helping but doing <caps> yourself would feel a whole lot better
books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age
but so are those that believe that these things are good
so i <caps> to loosen up and have a good time
a lot of people have used computers to learn different cultures
computers also have the best search engines
i eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down
those are three of the most important reasons why i think computers benefit society
the movies and music i think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it
another obstacle was to fix the buildings structure so it could with stand the mast
so in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation
it is all according to you own personal opinion
each individual has their own opinion of each material
for many students it is hard to compose essays in a public schools library
every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is
my favorite is the overweight problem
he is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home
what i mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents
that made everyone laugh
music can get too extensive as well
when my mom was done i was patient and then we left home
here is another reason why the computer is great for society
another book that tells of times during slavery is the <caps> of <organization>
others should <caps> ruin the experience by marking the words out
she is by far one of the funniest people i have ever met in <caps> entire life
being patient is a very important thing
first it shows that she is starting to like this new life
i told her that i will call her after my chores where done and go out for lunch
this section does not have any explicit language
although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you
once the teams were done they called all the squads to the mat it was award time
besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future
but is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are
laughter is a huge part of anyones life
then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined
and the laughter helped us
i noticed tears coming down all over my face
i opened it and a blinking light flickered saying <num> missed calls from <person>
he easily passes the snake and moves on
<month> find interesting and exiting
if we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well
i have never gone a day without laughing
his parents have there arms and doors open to those who will do the same for them
please listen or your child could stay back
i had a great angle in all but one direction
censorship on libraries
he said my parents always kept up their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family
he said they were wrong
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles
in this next paragraph i will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries
censorship in libraries is something good to have and something bad to have
then me and my mom and i were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back
she concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now
as you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and i think that is what gives it such a happy mood
a hour later i came down and asked
most <caps> do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active
<caps> was a rainy night
he passed away about a year ago
there are many computer games are there that you have to react quickly to and call for fast reflex and hand eye coordination
the geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day
everyone has the right to read and write what they want
less and less people are to enjoy a fresh <date> and instead spend it indoors on their country
mostly every person has a computer and it does not effect there lives a lot
work very good with moody people
some of the material found <month> be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being wrong
when either of us is going through a ruff time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while
some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it
libraries have all kinds of books
this is a major contributor to the failed attempt
just because a book talks about the <caps> and <caps> dying <month> be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults
no one every told him
almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions
i can i believe computers are helpful
computers let us keep in touch with others
the main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note
thank you for your time
another thing i like are sports
i just moved again it was my <num> high school
there were <num> major reasons why the mooring mast of the empire state building was never really completed
only people would think its fun to home and go on the computer for no reason
<caps> thing is that he was running out of water
in the constitution is states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose
if you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go
i remember when my friend was over and i was on a computer
foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with
this shows that kids spend more time using the computer then anything else
being patient is a wonderful thing to be
you can look into going there for vacation or doing a report
when you hear the word patience what do you think of
adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library
new things can be learned from them
i was <percent> irrevocably in love with <caps>
we thought it would take a few more minutes
these are my three reasons why we should spend less time on computers
it would never make it from the start
my unhappy thoughts disappeared and i was smiling
computers have changed the way we research and finish school works
i would like to state on my behalf that i do not agree that computers are good for society
not to be mean or anything
you mostly just move your hands and fingers
every once and a while my brothers and sister and l are just kind of hard to handle
a time i was patient is when my little brother kept messing with me
they had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea
everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read
i was very excited because i knew that i was getting a cell phone and thats all i wanted
those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist
the builders of the empire state building faced not so many but difficult obstacles
more and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies
unless some people are not mature at all and cant read books that are not even talking about them
thats a reason how to look up things it is easier to look up things instead of looking it up the most way
the dishes need to be done now
we waited for a long time
the building could catch of fire and be a danger for all
except for one thing that she quickly recognized
movies have a rating system for a reason
if there is no laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead
this shows that his parents taught his something important without telling him by showing him
i got out as fast as possible
the movie could be rated <num> but the parents still check it out for them
my mom was asleep it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before
getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it
we talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other
at that point i was practically crying from laughing so hard
it ruins your marriage if you are married
an explosion above the empire state building would be devastating to the city
then are team went and had lunch while some of the teams were still performing
the people wont like it and they might not want to check it out again or they wont check nothing out
i think the memoir is a thankful and grateful mood
the only way to cook would be with fire
the cyclist witnessed the intense features of the setting
it can also give kid information like weather updates that help to keep then safe
about <num> minutes later my mom hung up her phone
immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to
his parents helped him and gave him hope
i nervously asked <caps>
i think that means every book is bad if shes saying <caps> i think shes saying
we got our tickets and headed off into the plane
computers can and make you
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
so then you play more and get addicted
plus in todays world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has there own opinion and there own belief
over <percent> of adults complain that <caps> <caps> never enough time in day
thats why people turn out like they do
use it for entertainment
the clock winding down
it turns out that wait was worth it
but i got seed in my coat pocket
this quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water
and they do help people that have physical needs
an unintelligible noise came from <organization> pillow
people are ignoring their health and instead staying on the computer
so basically like i said you <caps> do anything
when she says and beside it was yet another old friend
note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz
this evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried
her <time> had been going just about as well as mine was
the other mood in the memoir is gratitude
some of the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float
those are fun and great way to interact with your family
well if not then when you are not busy you should try it
at the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable
this was a time when i was patient
he talked with a relaxed feeling and loving everything about his home and culture
my parents knew i wanted to do a job to buy things what i wanted
things that you could just see like the <organization> <organization> that was pretty cool i thought and all of the monuments
they simply are not a positive effect on people
there was a lot of waiting and a lot whining but we finally made it through
they moved from their country so that he could grow up in <location>
the time went by and i was still angry i current forget about what had happen
the whole nervousness i had at the beginning of the day was gone
now its your turn to tell us what you think about the computers
<caps> asked as <caps> put his hand on my lap
while growing up i had a friend who was very religious
i do that all the time and i like it
these things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike
computers offer another way to learn things about the world
dirigibles outside of the <location> used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles
people need to just calm down and smell the roses and forget about things that do not matter
actually <num> out of every <num> tourist research the area there going to on a computer
they came to <location> for him to have a better life
so once more me and my cousin went in to the restaurant
one time i was patient when i was in <location> getting on a ride called <caps> <caps> parents <caps>
the cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved
its use of certain words are offensive to those with sensitive ears
or even go to our local library
we were about half way threw the line when my nerves kicked in i was really scared but i knew i had to be brave and suck it up
these are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate
it was just another day on the farm and we were out running the machines
i was looking my patience and getting frustrated
you newer know what would happen
these changes would cost over sixty thousand dollars
the cyclist was greatly affected by the features of the setting
laughter helped the members of the <organization> accept what they could not control and ultimately lead to our success today
people of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines
we were almost at the school and i was bouncy from the caffeine and excitement mix
another feature of the setting was the heat
this is a very opinionated topic
the aircrafts so were also at risk of landing on sharp spires of other buildings
it had the <caps> word in there a lot
this is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together
after all that time and money he was told that the plan would have to fall through
he and i would joke about all my problems
personally i fall on the ground laughing hysterically
she called out a persons name it was hot mine
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i live in the <location>
its all over the web an etc
this means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct
i just think that computers are ruining the life of many people
doctor <caps> brown says everyone should go outside to just relax mostly everyday because staying in the house is not good
you can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country
<num> years ago i look a trip to <location> for the first time
computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do
i have patient until <date> vacation comes along
the cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him
school is a big thing nowadays
many things are said to bring people together
then i stood up and started to walk toward the front of the room
computers help us see the unseen
we stayed these until the park closed
there are many different kinds of skateboards the people who skate them ride them different
another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world
but computers can actually do the opposite
books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries
for example it states this place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town
on the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing
some friends and family keep in touch completely by computer
because they have affect on people who use computers and other electronics
over all i believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be addicted so called toy
also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that
in doing this most times where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening
the fact that he just laughed really made the situation a lot less stressful
in <caps> <num> it explains how a u
the cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building
they could go on the computer and tell their friend
he finished the next day
the mask itself was made out of whisked egg whites and toilet paper
this comes right out and tells you there is a rough road
this is on issue that needs attention
dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than helium
there is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty
<location> graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not
the designers had to spend <money> to reinforce the buildings frameworks
the thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the empire state buildings top floors are now a public tourist spot
i think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it says
it was a play boy bunny magazine
when i was at cedar point i had a lot of patience
as we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly
that report was done <date> when they were fixed
think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites
primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause
the concept of a docking mast for the empire state building met with failure because of a variety of reasons
the frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work
the best way to pass the time is laughing with friends and family
then i finally got there
every day i must be patient in difficult things
we had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye
children know what they suppose to read and does not
computers teaches handeye coordination
they think oh this girl is pretty
almost everything on the computer has to be read so <caps> gives a lot of practices
that goes with magazines and books
its good for education mind exercise and communication all over the world
computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things
another obstacle they had to face was testing there plan to dock dirigibles
the setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways
i was smiling and laughing again
it is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they wont take everything personally and can understand a joke
to me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life
after looking around he says
this is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general
certain people <month> find things offensive and others <month> think it is perfectly fine to have in a library
i remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments
so we had to wait patiently
<caps> need to make changes to what they do during the
he talked about how grateful he was that his parents selflessly came to <location> to give their child a better life
in the <organization> every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to
a computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime
so leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose
the setting of a desert in the uncultured
there are so many fun things you can do outside
she feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable
you cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them
being patient is waiting and not getting frustrated
we looked at the ride and hopped on
the desert just made him want water even more
computers messes up kids grades
i do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different
it is also very beneficial to students because if they forget a homework assignment they can log onto <caps> and ask a classmate
we still tease her a lot about it even though its been two months
computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country
they can be amazing for a while but only for a while
with a book you have to give it a chance to seek in your mind so that you do get an understanding
<caps> calls again and <caps> its clear
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
i think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me
it was useful and did not waste my time
to reflect back on those memories made the author happy
i had fun seeing my uncle and aunt
it is as simple as that
one phrase that is very important to censorship is things that they believe
my team and i all went to the bathroom
the builders of the empire state building faced a myriad of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the memoir is happy because it shows that he has a lot of good relations with many people that he calls family
<caps> convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her
and even meet them someday
the book that <caps> choosing is called <caps> <caps> <caps>
you would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again
the author of the passage ends the story with this statements to creates curiosity
during the <date> of the sixth grade <caps> parents decided they were getting a divorce
while we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom
he talks about how him and his family used to come together and have meals as a family
some people games and play
i am telling you we need to address this matter
my reward was being able to leave the doctors office
these days the computer is the latest hit
my cousins and i were talking for a long time
its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves
until she start losing her her job
at anytime about <num> billion are on some sort of electronic device
the computer helps the world everyday
this quote states the changing terrain
i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family
<caps> he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a batteryacid flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink
later that day i found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river
most dirigibles during that time
letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way
then on <date> my uncle came over for my family reunion
tether to hold the mast down because it put to much stress on the buildings frame and foundation
we would be reaching out to many new children as we held a <organization> for a week in the small <caps> town
the time i was patient was last <date> when we went to the cedar point
our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow
sure enough there was a big tan spot <person> the white tree
first of all the drive it was horrible and long
thats an example how he was grateful
the <caps> source is very helpful to many people
some <month> even seem provocative
one of these problems with the sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building
he did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees
we even use computers in libraries why the library
<person> and i would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from <caps> and laugh constantly about <num> <time> <caps> is also where we adapted the demonic voice
another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town
i worked very hard when i left the audition
i disagree with that
if we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet <caps> will stay around longer and we could make the a better place
lets take <location> for example
as we were walking around to find the music box we stumbled onto a baby stroller so we took turns pushing each other in it
its what makes friendship and relationship click
i have had personal experience with these kinds of problems
patient is when you are listening and tolerant of how someone feels
another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety
it saves gas money and time
we stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more
he was riding up and down rolling hills
she said that she had to go to <caps> to get some groceries
he says that he knows that family is not just blood related
my friends are always a place i can go to for a pick me up
the same should go for a library
i was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is i <month> do
this is important to because i am not very well organized when it comes to school
with all of these obstacles the builders realized that this would not work
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
even two year olds need to interact with other two year olds
my mom is probably a little bit worse than me but we are both pretty bad
like when were talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk
those are my three reasons
the mood created by the author was a great mood
another cause why books or magazines <month> be removed from the shelves could be that the send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content
profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness
the deer heard the arrow launch and ran
you have to take your time and know that you are timed
censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years
so many people have them because their helpful and another current learning resource
at every click of your mouse there are new things to learn
helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on
one more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas
the girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too
now if it was a book that has been misplaced i would take it from them
the author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release
so there is no reason for it to be taken off
when <location> was finally free from <caps> a main goal was to have our freedom of speech
<person> tell her well learn how to control the in
these obstacles leaves builders faced with unrealized challenges to over come
lastly the computer strengthens hand eye coordination
some of the books that maybe on the shelf <month> hurt some ones feelings
consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not
one obstacle was that the builders cannot just drop a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building
some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while
another obstacle that would be faced is nature
i tried and tried to avoid him although <caps> always seemed we were having to deal with each other more than either of us wanted to
this led to a playful warm tone as he lead to his grandparents who also enjoyed a meal at his house
but the people who like the item say like an explicit <caps> they would probably buy it
i decided to go back to sleep and did for only about thirty minutes when i woke up again
so removing these books would be pointless because where ever you put them people will just go there to get the material they want to know about
i was <caps> mad and just what she said come back tomorrow and well have your size
so after <num> months of dating i met the folks
turns out i was fine
using the computer seems to have more advantages than disadvantages
the hard part was getting <person> out
to start with her love is like part of her life
minutes later we finial got a hold of ourselves and mom went to go get some paper towels to clean up my mess
my dad drove us to a park that had a huge pond in the middle of it
i can definitely tell my mood change from parent to parent
it really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me
but she failed setting if there on time
the libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves
they also help us be different and more creative people
a time i was patient
so keeping them in shelves could help our future
i was being tortured by the thought of using the restroom
computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers
if adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer
if i was a person who got offensive by something that was on the shelf at the library i would pass it up and not pay attention to it
many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people
this made his journey very dangerous
here is a story about being patient
its his dad calling to say
movies guidelines are along the same pattern
everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media
finally i would want to help out and i really enjoyed my field trip
of sleep ever <date> which lets us make it through school
the author is grateful for the things parents did for him so he could get a better life
patience is important in life
once we got there the line was all the way to the train
i would read as long as it takes but it just has to be the right book for me
thus through the use of computers i was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now its my
inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids
it was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water
it is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas
another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it <month> make other reads feel like they are not alone
but you cant hide from it all your life
i believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems
two other people were behind me and they helped me up and then we ran around the bus
they complete us all
soccer practice friends home and other places if i need to go there
it makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge
on the other hand rather than books being taken off the shelf books would not be being put on the shelfs
this would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked
his mother was a chemical <organization>
while you have problems and obstacles that makes you a good person
we resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons
so go ahead and try different kinds of laughs
we started heading home and i slide around with every step i took
you cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes
computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do
one <organization> the only ways she can contact her father is through <organization>
i was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter
elders of the empire state building faced many complications safety was a major concern
the reason i support this is because i like to look up history about <caps> and <caps> pioneer who have changed humanity
it was already morning they took us to a room
my uncle who is there with us tends to play tricks on the kids and embarrass me
she had bought <caps> hibiscus as a comfort to herself
your child finds a magazine
the next thing that pulled on my fishing rod was a big white bass
some people think its alright
in <num> grade my sister and i played the patient game
she told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants
were done with the house <caps> the car has yet to be washed she answered
its hard enough to be quite
then <caps> started telling me a joke
censorship in todays libraries is a major issue
another obstacle they faced was nature
in paragraph <num> it says they struggled both personally and financially
just <caps> walking through <organization> in a banana costume with one of your best friends
but for the hotels they were kind of last minuet
people find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
lets say i was a fan of <person> and i read that she stole something
a library should be a place of balance
the majority of my jokes and humor consists of depressing things
i was also a little bit scared
he ran downstairs to his room as i continued to stand there with my mouth gaping
<caps> is positive and positive energy is good
offensive language <month> be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases
the author creates a mood in this memoir
we sit around and listen to music talking and having fun
it also works well for giving your children a memory they will always remember
all these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger
however that evening i was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life
laughter helps in so many situations throughout life
i will tell you some of the reasons why i <caps> this
we are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say
first at the end of the memoir <caps> was <caps>
you said why todays a nice day
it was a mans voice <organization> some background music
so else how bad the computer is
one of the most loyal customers to the library are children and their parents
i believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things
<person> and me were good friends and she had lost her shyness and i was starting to really like her
you can use a phone instead and call them
they worked really hard
chatting on the computer is great
items containing vulgar language is unjust to most
people i know have complained of their eyes hurting after using the computer
one <date> <time> back in <date> a couple of friends and i were beyond bored
there are people out there that might disagree with me and i can see where they are coming from too
they <month> also need adult combinations to preview the movie
like afternoons or during lunch time
it will causes you to be come one with another
so we called <caps> and had creatively talked him into taking us
i do hope that in the future we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over reaction to something offensive
she was about <num> inches shorter then me and she had short black hair
<organization> hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her
then we went to there house got ready and we were off to a day we had all been waiting for
when they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it
books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity
in my opinion i say no to this question
int he library there are many magazines that are meant for adult eyes only
i have never been so proud in my life the <caps>
because of all the obstacles the mooring mast would never be used
do you think we have to wait for it to unlock
we knew we had patience
its quite funny to see her reaction
the first reason why i think using a computer is good for people is because you <month> have to look up something on the computer one day
language is a big part of todays world and many do not appreciate a bad word
the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time
it <month> be in favor of something or it <month> not be
i am going to tell you all of the reasons i think the books should stay on the shelves
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify
one reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels
even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up the back part of the ship would sway from the wind
i would be nothing without her
if some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them
one way is interacting with different people all over the world
one of the first problems they faced was not being able to land
others like the books that other people dislike
the author concludes with this because it had the most impact
it would put too much stress to the building
it was good to see kids that will be on my school and in my classes
it was <organization> and <person>
after we got off i said mom that patience really paid off
she has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like shes about to cry
their home was almost a sanctuary
someone who wants to can so do not take that away from the people that want to read <caps>
the common people live in a so called <caps> <caps> <caps>
it was also very hot there
first we stopped by my house so i could grab my swim suite that i recently ordered off line and was dying to use it
being patient is a very important skill to have
the mood created by the author in this memoir is generosity
with this new generation authority can only limit so much of what children see today
a time when i was patient is when i play volleyball
technology is advancing every day
i also think its caring because he understood what was going on
the way that he describes his parents hard work and love is incredible
when we started to head back down the mountain <person> let <person> drive down
the mood in the memoir is happy
no one really goes for walks any more either
watching <person> dance to my voice was the funniest thing i could ever see
ten more minutes had passed and i began to get thirsty
through the use of computers people will be taught handeye coordination
i quickly take a shower and get dress into jeans and t shirt
a day without laughing is a waste of a day
he is going to yell at <caps> pretty soon
it turns out that <person> and i completely ignored <person> and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes
i believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf
all of those obstacles contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show and contributing to the worlds tallest building
imagine how angry the parents of the child would be
most dirigibles from outside of the <location> used hydrogen rather than helium
for a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us
the purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff
this made it harder for builders to accomplish because its against the law
the author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future
the communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising
<caps> is a very true statement
it is at this point that he uses the word crippling because he is just about exhausted and cant go any further
<caps> people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive
people can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library
it gives people a good education
the narration of rough road ahead a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story
the project was so difficult that they had to quit the task and expand at another time
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
i think the quote laughter is the shortest distance between two people
so i was in two weeks of pain
he was yelling <caps>
i have been in a library a few times in my life
computers have positive effects on people
its great that kids have a place to go in there free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read
it brought me and <person> together in the beginning and it keeps us together even now
being patient is hard <caps> can be rewarding
thats who <caps> mom and i were and were still like that
i told them all that i could and went back to the house
we wont ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem <month> be solved
<person> reached <person> and immediately burst into roaring laughter
computers are now an important piece of society
i could be in the worst of moods and <caps> always knows how to put a smile on my face
when you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body
every week i was so excited for <caps> so i could spend time with <organization>
the mood the author portrays is love and unity
one in example is to <caps> a <caps>
another main reason was nature itself
kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects
so its pretty much a lazy distraction
this was going to take a lot of patience
so i just keep waiting and i was also patient
in my life there have been numerous obstacles which i have had to persevere through
when we made the decision to go on the <caps> ride first
one good thing patience can get you to good places
then we were on the rode again for <num> hours
as stated in paragraph <num>
sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination
social network sites are good for <caps>
all my friends thought i hurt my man parts
the mood of the author is happy
you can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine
we as people need knowledge
the mood of this memoir is warm and friendly
a set of engineers are working finding a workable and faster arrangements
the workers had to change their first design to meet the mandatory requirements for the mooring mast
i thought of what the words i needed to say to <person> but i was confuse
he was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted
in preparation to the construction of the mast the architects first took tours of the equipment at the <organization>
its great that the teachers care enough to post the homework
that is the obstacles the empire state building faced in creating a docking area for blimps
it takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing
when she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden
all those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was not practical or feasible
<caps> with the amount the dirigible <person> and the wind the buildings frame would not be strong enough and would have to be modified and strengthened
her mother then comes and shares the moment with her
parents can usually monitor what their kids check out
they are also helpful because they solve problem that humans might have trouble with
being on the computer too much can harm your brain also
i walked with him to avoid the image of being any more of an outcast
there are several features that causes the author to dehydrate
thats how the setting affected was
this is what it was like for me and <caps>
she asked me and i said that it was my brother
the cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked brackish
the author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus
sometimes you got to work with what you got and <caps> might turn out more fun than your normal plan you made
that is the question
you can go to the or to the aquarium
they might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for
yes we do live in a world where everyone is judged by how they
<person> finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack
a person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style
<caps> was my best friend until the end
now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future
it symbolizes togetherness and coming together as a family
there can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation
she became very lazy
the builders of the empire state building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
you can chat with people from across the world
<caps> and i thought that would be fun to go on a trip
they can only do something about <caps> their children are doing
the features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot
hydrogen is highly flammable and actually caused a dirigible to be destroyed by fire
as well as nature working against the mooring mast so was the law
yet <caps> very lovable and sometimes sweet
without having access to a computer and its contents residents have a difficult time embarking themselves within the rest of society
some materials in libraries <month> have information that is offensive towards others
i am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody
we protect each other from messing up are lives to much
in my opinion i would think they have a neutral effect on people
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
everyone grows up in a different lifestyle
after a few weeks we both sighed up for a youth camp
it took <num> minutes to get our drinks though
this is certainly a great form of technology people should have
my mom even got a boyfriend that she later broke up with
his water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die
many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship
i will tell you about when i was patience
when you take away a mans voice and emotions you are left with an empty shell of a person who will never know life to the fullest
<person> raised the shampoo bottle over his head
its a form of entertainment as well as to build knowledge
she goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer section
then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone
first off we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers
i started to laugh and knew i had an issue
one of the <caps> of <caps> statements is <caps> of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want
some of these problems were because of what the balloon was made of
movie we watch today talk about doing drugs and how cool they are and how they had fun driving a stolen car
by jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen
the winds would be constantly shifting the mast
another obstacle the architects faced was a concern of safety
this leads to my next paragraph
some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self
computers are used by millions of people every day
as grandma was leaving my brother and i sat on moms lap and gave her a big hug and said i love you <caps>
we got to the park and rode some rides
look at what they have involved into <date>
its a great way for us to communicate with our busy schedules when we cant always get together
the author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons
although people might think to be false it is indeed true
she is doing the test again when the starts over so she can do
the mood created in this memoir is a warm feeling that surrounds the meaning of family and home
this was going to be a long day for <person>
<person> got to the line at <time> and has been there for <num> hour and she only got <num> autographs done
the cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store
and make everyday tasks simple
the ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased
this is why the builders of the empire state building faced in <caps> to allow dirigible to dock there
by the time they get out they are broke
all new ways to communicate with people
and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day this is an example of how he lost courage
i swear i was so irritated i wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey
on the other side of the stage was our competitors <person> and <caps>
of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube
i would always backtrack of my days so i had a personal calendar for counting down to it
they need to get outside get some exercise
she is possibly the funniest thing to walk the <location>
the things they cannot read are censored
a computer can also hold pictures that you take on a digital camera
we would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game
all of them you can communicate in different ways
i ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns
laughter can truly mend a broken heart
the first problem for the builders came up about the buildings frame
so this is the first reason <caps> read the next on
knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling
so you might as well get used to it
<caps> <caps> a day where there are no books in the school library
i started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun
people also can learn to have a personality because they in use
the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story do not exceed posted speed limit
he took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut
also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves
all of these are valid reasons as to why a parent <month> advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries
in fact one out of fifty books contain racism
in conclusion the author created in mood through this memoir that family has many different meanings
there are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life
the cost for these modifications were another problem for them two
you can look up <organization> yoga poses
some how amongst the trip we laughed together at everything
other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see
once upon a time there were two boys named <organization> and <person>
people learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters
also for questions you can go to one of the websites an you ask the question and many other people might answer the question your looking for
we ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride
computers are important because your child will get the proper education that they need
it felt like <num> hours
books are very important to people and need some entertainment other than television
although they is struggling but they are have happiness
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
when we look back we see that the <organization> censored and destroyed anything that went against them
the main challenge was caused by nature itself
some of there reasons are because parents could have young children and they do not want to expose them to such things while they are young and vulnerable
seeing this plant again makes her remember memories from her homeland
but the problem could do with computers
its not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from
the cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water
after we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name
i had nothing to entertain myself with
computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees
at the end of my speeches i begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock
you can watch all types of movies
they <month> even became your new best friend
the first obstacle was one of safety
the book <caps> <caps> <caps> is about a young girl that grew up without a father
smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support
adults should be able to watch all movies
theres so much to discover so much to be explored
after that wore off we finished the wordsearch <caps> started a new one
computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world
laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time
teenagers as well as adults need to communicate through computers
if they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then i know plenty more novels that would be gone as well
i think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons
we should let the computers be in the <location>
hes not really my friend but he come one to talk to
so being patients mean you have to able to wait
computers are a common household item these days
now because of this family is
<organization> by <person> is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison
the ratings are from <caps> to <caps>
many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age
not paying attention of whats in front of them my mom fell in to a mud pit and my dad tried to get her out but slipped in too
they could also find interesting things to see in that country
at the party i was patient until we could open the presents
music is a great way to clear your mind and relax
i would love to hang out with you <person>
a lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today
the computer also helps you to learn
they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
during this time he is riding his bicycle for miles and miles in the heat of the summer
they struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships
i believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials
that was one of her traditions with it
the libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it
inflaming the public is not what you want young authors
then by far this stuff helps
we waited for the rides to start back up
we stayed there all weekend
to me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was
once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore
<caps> grabs <caps> hand and walks me closer to <caps> friends
it was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed
the builders of the empire state buildings had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there
where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called <caps> <organization>
he actually thought he might die
if it to graphic for kids put it in the adults area
in the end the plan failed
another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone under age rents a movie or there parents rent the movie
two weeks later on a weekend he was out messing around and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof
they can also entertain us when we have nothing to do
every day at launch i have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch
thank you for your time
i was the only patient one at our table
everyone knows it and everyone loves it
there are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned
riding with <caps> brother and i in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated
another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left
laying there anxiously someone whispers here it comes
the stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at <num> feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure
also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude
you cant do this to me
<caps> hugged with <caps> still streaming down their faces
i recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer
its truly disgusting
apparently <caps> mom was to because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me a side and thanked we for being so patient
when designing the mooring mast for the empire state building there were many challenges architects and builders had to over come
lastly the mood is happy
this was not a good idea to be using these at the empire state building
computers also develop handeye coordination which is an essential skill for later in life
my third and last reason is their job
a mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life
another obstacle is the winds
so after i came home from school i left right back out
to her it is a symbol of strength and comfort
some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it
she feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her
however this was not the case
many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them
all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
his parents are loving people and so is <location>
make it hard for them to do their homework
i feel closer and part to keep in touch with them
young ladies want to have big boobs and butt
while we were not dating he would always find away to make me laugh or smile
children are influenced by the things they see
scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be
i looked at him with a dumb face and said <caps>
many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites
a normal person encounters several occasions a day where they <month> hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends
everyone has an opinion
we used to have about <num>
that is the purpose of the institution of education
thats not even close to what really happens
thats what you hear your parents say all the time right
you could look it up and find out what the park has to offer
like a job you print out a paper every week or day even
my sisters might not even care
the mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring and it shows appreciation to the authors parents
the cyclist is affected by <num> couple different things
i believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express your self on things
another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the empire state building was nature
the man was very crazy
then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her
this all shows that the narrator is happy with his family in pleased of where he lives
so while i waited for him i decided to ride my bike
the features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse
the teacher understand that i did not understand <caps> to do the work
censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries
the setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay
<caps> and i were covered in mud
all of these reasons come together and say the computer does benefit society
i discussed this with my mom once and she completely agrees with me
i woke up the next morning and ran downstairs
people need them to have an enjoyable life
i believe patience is important for many reasons
the lack of water really affected the cyclist
its good and you can get things done the
either way we have a sense of humor
when i met him i fed him some of my bait and i guessed he liked warms so i gave him all my bait put down pole
the last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight
the library should be divided into different parts
the technology of computers to learn about the far away places
we scrubbed and scrubbed until all the red paint from the side of the the building was gone
then i start seeing water parks and hotels it was really nice
one because they can interact with others
he saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be
i get <caps> to stop crying
this allows you to type and sent emails faster
as you can see these are the reasons i think it has good effect
like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs
there was only one more <date> left
you can avoid things you find offensive
the computer can really help you
censorship is a terrible thing for libraries
the setting effects the cyclist in many ways
those with the obstacles the builders could never overcome
we rested before we went out to enjoy the snow
censorship wont stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them
the reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves and its not a laughing matter
i felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again
he started out with a smile on the face
i do <caps> think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well
i listen to music all the time as long a i like the way it sounds
finally they opened up the ride again so now my other brother and sister did not come with us
problem is <caps> made <location> go in
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
so i told him to go get one of his shoes and i will teach him
this would add stress to the buildings frame with the combined pressure of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure
that would make anyone yearn for the one place where they too felt this feeling circulating around them
such as the rated <caps> movies or books that are inappropriate for young children
he hesitantly asked me
the computer also has various pictures which is also good
he told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball
some have never been offended
he knows me better than anybody else
computers help people find a nice spot to travel
one obstacle the builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area
computers do help you
the three of us caught a chair up to the top of the run
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the air pressure was another obstacle that was faced
he once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around
mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another
everyday i go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play
the <caps> <caps> books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it
while typing your report on the computer you might spell a word wrong well every computers has spell check
instead of going on computers
a second way the author sets the mood is by sneaking in deeper thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses
thank you for your time <caps>
another reason i feel this way is the way he describes the types of friendships he has with is neighborhood
it is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster
<organization> can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place
the computer can teach us many new and exciting things
music is made for the enjoyment of the people
when i got to my grandma house
voting is always important and people should notice that
they gave up their career and beloved country to move to <location> for her to have a better life
another term for not patient is inpatient
libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this
they can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored
but we kept on laughing because <person> nephew kept on dancing
from <date> to <date> the numbers of obese people increased from <percent> of <location> citizens to <percent>
for some reason i like travel every where with her
they say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker
time is mainly all we have
explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive
it was the first time we had been there in over twelve years because my mom and i could not go visit them do to immigration problems
for these reasons is why computers do not benefit society
that was a horrible idea
but at that moment i fell in love
all this would happen because he was on a computers
one time my <caps> planned a fishing trip to <location>
so being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make <caps> worse
we replied thanks bro same to you
we all ran to the ship and realized that there was a line
another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself
<caps> rolled up off the couch and stood by <person> and the truck
no later than a day when <person> was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her
leaving the story to end like this is a cliffhanger for some
another reason to ban censorship in books is because thats an authors writing style
now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights
find about <location> without the expense of a plane ticket
people can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time
reading is very important for kids these days
i love it when people are not afraid to be themselves
i check it almost everyday when i come home from school
finally i did about two back flips into the water
<caps> hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball
he admired for his parents strength and perseverance
my stepdad took a look at them and said that it was going to be rewired
here is another reason why computers are good
it was a really fun day
picture yourself walking through the library with your child
one day at around nine p
it is like falling into a pool of <caps>
i heard everyone in the line groan
i know now why laughter is very important in a relationship
a frontfull is a big twisty thing in the air
about half way through the semester we would get in trouble in class for talking to much and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends
i wanted to eat right then
in the excerpt the mooring mask by <person>
this ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice
i was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy
i like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans
i believe we should be patience
so in conclusion patience is a good like skill to have because it can help our progress in life
one of the obstacles builders faced was nature itself
a quote proving this is i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
humor and laughter are different from each other
it helps people because they could <caps> projects
the banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge
those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters
the article by <organization> titled the mooring mast describes well the problem blimps may have encountered
people really enjoy those moments that they spend with a special someone
i have been patient many time here are a few of them
the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist
one more reason is communication
the cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles
after that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail
its all about trying to become accustomed to changes
not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via <caps> or any of the others it is nice to chat
a time when <caps> dad was patient
recently <caps> been patient
when she completes and past her test she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day
at the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts
architects constructing the empire state building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast
getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable
all of the things that a computer can do are great
every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone
we had never seen <person> so mad
<caps> was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face
in the car we talked about the <caps>
we talked all the way back to <location>
so people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down
when we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in
thats the only time i remember laughter being my true friend
my mother came in my room upset and frustrated
the human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates
we were around <num> years old and in <num> through <num> grade
so keep the books on the shelves
this i think can help with the problem
one bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom
patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it
i think it offends lots of people
i know i like to go on the computer better then carrying really heavy books home
now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people
its nights like <caps> were laughter really plays a key role between a big group of friends like i have
i think that many would agree to this if it was proposed
it is when you are calm and waiting
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i guess it really is true that laughter is the shortest distance between two people
the features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist
the love that they got for each other
everyone on <caps> team seemed slightly weirded out by me
then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
the problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end
he is also trying to say that there is no way to express his emotions and love to his parents
children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out
these changes quickly become a part of our communication and writing
this shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test
after he said that about <num> girls went crazy screaming
whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else
in paragraph <num> he says it was here where i learned the real definition of family
music is offensive but like i said only found in the adult area
and one of those many thought to be impossible was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds
computers also have some more practical uses
the first troubling encounter for the builders was they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building
also in paragraph <num> its a paragraph dedicated to his parents
as we were kicking the ball i got an idea
<caps> i was still bored
in the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill
it had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
there is also less and less facetoface interactions with family and friends
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
maybe they will become ore friendly and become more outgoing
if these materials are using offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against that race then they should be taken off of the shelves
computers is what we use to live we need them to survive
another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible
the true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh
offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it
the library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well
the way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a cord attached to the mast
why i believe <caps> is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways
when we got to the van we all said it was fun
thats how i saw it and thats how he saw it too
it can also help with healing
everybody has a different taste in media
one time <caps> mom took a test to become a <caps>
<caps> i would very much like to be your girlfriend
their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship
i mostly wanted it because <organization> is the company that makes it and this is the last game <organization> was making because some other company bought the <caps> series from <organization>
we all have our reasons to laugh
i had previously told him how i love stuffed animals
we waited and waited and waited till finally he called are name
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful
some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them
handeye coordination is very helpful in sports
its kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not
<person> picked <caps> to be my partner
the capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world
now here is a <num> year old kid standing behind his <caps> with the nozzle end of a hose with <caps> bending over in front of me
my first reason i believe computers are good to have around is
i tried not to show that i was nervous
authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like
driving on the old back roads of <caps> in the old <organization> on our way to <location>
thats exactly what i did on the ride over
one day i was at the store with my friends
over <money> worth of changes had to be made to strengthen the buildings framework
when doing this you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored
religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects
he look at it then he started helping me with it
this just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse
the hibiscus she bought was away to comfort her
they would be able to handle something in the adult material category
well thank you for reading my opinions about computers
you also use the computer to do work
i was glad i had enough patience to wait in those long lines
and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead
so to start us off i will tell you a story that has laughter in which fixed a few ed between my grandpa <caps> and my cousin <person>
i think that creates a very calming are caring mood
no one knew that this was going to happen
a time i was patient at <organization>
there were many ways the author created the mood
but taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to land there
most people in <location> have a computer in their home
so my mom and them all tell <caps> that i need to learn to understand shes in a better place with some of her love ones
the age of dirigibles
allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that maybe not have the info
censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society
<caps> is very grateful for how things turned out
it is free choice to listen to it
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves
<person> is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home
the last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students
the back of the ship will swivel around and around the mast cause of winds
this can lead them into getting obese
we need more good things to influence our children
one of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking
the winds are constantly shifting
also you lost all your friends contacts
this at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time
the author generally stayed in one mood
people cant make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore its offensive to everyone who reads it
i knew <caps> would do that
so now you are sitting around the computer eating
our teacher from sophomore year <person> always told us that were very giggly and that it was a good thing
people who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them
to fix this problem the <organization> steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible
many people will answer this question differently
the people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece
i know <caps> worried
what we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe
in conclusion there was several obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
adjusting myself took me about a month
my selfesteem was getting a lot better <caps> it use to be
after those girls left i went and got the book they were talking about
then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library
my parents are doing this to protect me and i agree with their decision
<caps> was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door
there are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout
<person> was my <caps> teacher since the <num> grade and has been my role model all the way through life
that is why i felt the mood caring was created by the author
the mood created by the author in the memoir was the love your home and all of the people around it
but many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites
my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family
you probably used to do what little research you did them
quicker to find out information
<caps> went from just living there to it being his home
this is because he is talking about the love and bonds of family
i know many people <month> think how come using a computer is not safe
not only the students but teachers too
this can ruin relationship in and outside the family
<time> at the <caps> was playing that <time>
the wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents
kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it
then she told me i was getting <num> shots
finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over <num> in the past ten <date>
also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades <caps> doing so
these websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research
all libraries have different sections based upon age
people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take
many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit
they say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention
so i got out of the car and went and stood by the road
maybe you can go on <caps> or <caps> or <caps> or even your email
the authors mood in the memoir <person> is thankful
the blimps are held down with lead weights and this could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to ever go wrong
those too eventually ran out
we felt very positive with high energy
the fun messages are what makes everything so great
there are no buildings in site at all and no source of water
i cant understand why
i cant even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest
censorship is a topic that it strongly opinionated
everyone is titled to their own opinions
that is one reason computers are bad
there needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there
the next morning was not how <person> planned
by the time we were all heading to the <location> to fly back to <location> everyone was hanging out and there was no conflict
i cant even imagine what it would be like
one time my family and i were going to <caps> world
individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten
my best friends had set me up
i remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong
the rider says the sun was beginning to beat down
we had just finished going clothes shopping at the <organization> and mom said that i could pick where we went out to eat
as a result the setting was related to the authors moods
the author creates a peaceful mood in the memoir
i had no idea that all of my other friends would get it before i did
you could even play hide and seek with your friends <caps> even tag
the librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library and have the kids book in the younger section of the library
she stood at the head of the room and smiled
there is no way that anybody over the age of <num> has never played a computer game sometime in their life
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
<person> is the reason why there is an <caps> sticker on <caps> that contain offensive lyrics
the front rows seats were only for people over <num> because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer
there was even a law against airships flying too low over urban areas
another example that <caps> mother worked outside while it was cold to get her gardening done
and i believe if it is offensive it should be taken off the shelf in a library and you should too
i know i do that all the time
books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library
i had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story
staying on all day sitting down rating
after the girls game we all went to change
they can talk to each other but most of all see each other
in paragraph <num> the author states this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
i actually brought my <caps> with me
heres a time when i was patient
it takes you deeper into things
i let my brother go first
she could look to the plant for inspiration
people on computers waste a huge amount of their timer
computers take away from people enjoying natures joy
once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home
this paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus
one more set and we would win it
we can laugh at each other sometimes and we try to keep each of happy by making them laugh and feel good
i believe that having computers are a very good thing
the mood of the memoir is nostalgic and happiness
please take my ideas into consideration
the kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades
also there are many scams and cons out there on the <caps>
i had no idea who she was at the time
and as time goes on it can only get worse
i told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me while i was making a purchase
the terrain kept changing making it hard for him not to be thirsty
all <organization> could do was roll on the floor laughing
i have to use the computer
censoring these people can and would be horrible
we did clean up the glass though
i think its just a part of being best friends with someone
movies are rated based on their content
i you to be in of negative effects on people
these things are necessities to the world
you just need to look and stop trying for just one guy
i went back into my room and there i saw that i had gotten a text message from my <caps> friend <person>
this means that he felt he was close enough to everybody in his community it was like family
<caps> the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the family <caps> the neighborhood
she looked like the freaking <caps> <caps> of <location> all bent over like she was
on the way to the bank where my mom works we came across a dog chasing a squirrel
i was trying to keep calm while giving her directions in a very giggly manner
they can stick through it together
there are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen
in the story it say when he was riding that he barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down
not read or listen to things that can hurt someones inner feelings
so all you have to do is find anything to do if you cant do it
<person> was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentering shop
she is always dancing at music on commercials or singing opera
all aboard the mummy ride
so after that we pretty much argued the whole time
seems like <caps> has found a way to lead laughter into her household too
people are different and believe in different things
i saw people handing out blue rain jackets
well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies
another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land
lately my family has been eating in our living room
we where going through <location> at <num>
it is fun and easy to learn on a computer
that would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive
the last sentence in this memoir i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
patience is waiting for <num> hours in line to see a movie and not having to move around
i think as long as your reading whats it matter what it is or as long as your learning something
all those things tell her its a new year and makes it easier to accept whats happening
that was a time when i was patient
in conclusion there were too many large obstacles to overcome
and <caps> gets there in less then a minute
laughing and even giggling together is what <person> and i look forward to in our relationship
most dirigibles from outside of u
<caps> is so cute when she does this
saying no to censorship
when they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there
in school patience is very important because some things just have to wait
also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move
especially when all of you know that only one from the whole group will go to <location>
well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer
here is another reason why you should have patience
the concert was <num> days away
down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills
one of the books we had to find was the <caps> <caps>
my best friend and i have been friends for five years now and i hope that we will be friends for more years to come
in the everyday world people who break the law are put into jails and prisons
we ordered a <caps> and some drinks
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
thats when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men
i was patience when i had to baby sit
the same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away
there are just too many things that can be taken offensively
the mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness
the mood created by the author in
i love making people laugh
<person> said while trying to contain a giggle
my friend <caps> started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically
i could never imagine walking down the street and a lead weight being dropped on my head
those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist
take a chance and fight for what you believe in and vote for censored books
i lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area
i to was overjoyed at the thought but i had no idea of how awkward it would be to finally meet her the next <date>
also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web
books are the basic learning methods of education
<caps> waist <percent> of there spare time on their computer
i had want to school with my mom so she can take a test <caps> drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there
it is proven when it says the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof
personal and meaningful conversations <month> sometimes be
i got up on the bar and did it
i asked my mom can i have something to eat
parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to
i would trust her with my life if i had to
there is a lot of offensive music too
i kept going into the ice cold air
so now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing
they were able to overcome that obstacle
finally i said in paragraph <num>
i would want my children learning anything and everything about world history
when <caps> came to our table i was really excited and i started to drink <caps> really fast
i was eight at the time
no book should be removed because someone <month> find it offensive
some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends
these are just some of the great effects computers have on people
so all of the <num> kids start fighting
the builders of the empire state building were faced with many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock
the setting in the story affected the cyclist
the one without the computer needs to go to the library
i would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read
i over heard two girls talking
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
you have to control under the books
i believe we should not have that right to pull thing off of shelves freely
this is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place
in this memoir the mood created by the author is mostly happiness and celebration
the dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking
this statement shows what the author concludes about the story
these are pieces of evidence that describe the mood of the memoir
when games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue
political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story
the writer makes me feel joyful because it reminds me of what my family is like
even with the dirigibles tethered to the mooring mast the back end would swivel around the mast along with the wind
this also shows that the mood is in a happy mood because he is explaining everything great his parents have done for him
even when my grandma died she stayed cool
every time i saw her i would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking
my second reason is kid might have to look important things up
my opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and i support this technology
because the girl is willing to try again and to not give up no matter what
they were arguing about something
either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive
the cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal
the worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water
that day my coach told me i told you that you could do it it just takes time and patience but today was your day and you did it
dirigibles customarily landed in open fields
they brought love to all people
the first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building
these are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers
this means that friendship will wont see each other if they spend all day on the mental health when they turn on the computer
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
another obstacle was nature itself
i see things of half naked ladies on the side of the website and i know thats not okay for young kids to be seeing at those ages
these are all great ways to use computers
it was the longest line i ever stood in and i was very patient
<caps> was a boring cycle that i seemed to be trapped in
i think its reasonable the authors should be grateful for his parents courage
the geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time
<caps> with this sentence informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on
the meaning behind <time> would be that you can just turn a bad situation into a good one if you rearrange the problem
which is kind of sad if you ask me
we started stuff out
magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people
that just made it feel longer
so i looked up from my drawing
it is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads
computers create a relaxing entertainment opportunity
thankfully i had my <caps> so i watched a few cartoons and listened to music
they get addicted to that watching
its as simple as that
even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring <caps> the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast
spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful
when the hibiscus will budding she will take the test again
another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas
then the terrain in changes when he says flat road was replaced
the two of us scampered around the house looking in every room and brought all the pillows we could find back to the staircase
you can learn things on them or play games
while she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door
it would turn out to be a disaster
i thought it was because i got cracked
that wold be it until next <date> or until <caps> can play it again
<caps> <person> to the press
this story is about my trip to the doctors
she should be strong and follow the flow of life
in any situation laughter is used
then you have magazines
they show a persons opinion on something
i am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make <caps> own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading
thats what movie ratings are for
now in a <organization> library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs
this was going to be interesting
so the roof would have to be redone in order for it to be structurally sound
this is why libraries should have more than one copy
having the greatest time ever with each other
having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life
laughter is something we all need and it keeps us going with the world and the duties we do all day because we get frustrated a lot of times
like the food they ate and the music the played
she still had to clean up then she us what to clean up
even though i learn and spend time to watch how its done i get hurt and cant do it
this whole journey was all mental
our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved
without this basic necessity people cannot be happy
i stated my reasons why i think computers have a negative effect on people
in conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist
i was really mad that day
whether its a close friend or a coworker
again i had to wait <num> minutes to go on
this would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
have the right to freedom of speech
i remember going on and seeing something pop up about my favorite band breaking up
using a computer can lead to <caps> thefts
i got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was all ways telling jokes and teasing everyone
at this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out
the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
everyone has a right to read it at some point in time
one of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago
no need to look and look a hundreds of books just to get one little fact
me and her now everything there is to now about each other
the dirigibles would weigh the building down so they would have to find a way to prevent damaging the building
this problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites
he thinks it sounds amazing to drink
just one key expression or a twinkle in our eyes can crack the other up
if you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped
this enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events
<caps> is also mostly grateful for her parents
by changing him physically
they use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages
studies show that ninety percent of <caps> that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none
we have not even seen half of what media can do
communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important
<caps> reflecting my view on censorship in libraries
the issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children
they also have emails where they chat with other people
computers also have their flaws
<caps> we get back from church she replied
my best friend <person> really knew what i need to help me out
if you buy a computer your life would be more relaxing
in this article i am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days
i chose <caps> <caps> because i love their seafood
she also had to deal with living in a new country
that is how it was on new years eve
libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multibillion dollar industries to second guess their work
she waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient
the joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart
some people say laughter is the shortest distance between two people
like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together
so we started over and i helped him more and was very patient with him
with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air
in my opinion the computer was on of the best inventions made
the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to make the mast
the builders of the empire state building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock
these are the stories about a time i was patient
the winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move
i read a book but finished it
but there are so many benefits of a computer
the combination of this variety of problems put an end to the idea of using a mooring mast atop the empire state building
we both started laughing so hard
he usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories
the boy soldiers were walking around looking for her
weather they like it or not all books teach a lesson about life
when someone else asked for help
the biggest problem a safety
so when i see him running all over the place it makes me laugh
also if we can make something like computers imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements
i was standing and waiting for my turn
they are helpful for getting your local weather
i think them is we the amount of time could be lives
the author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the united states
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story
it can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life
no wonder schools have computer classes
it usually expresses the feeling of happiness and joy
<caps> was so anxious to take my sisters phone away that <caps> immediately asked for it before confronting my mother about it
our major goals as youngsters is to find people to like us
thats all they depended on
everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce
this is the same for the books that are on library shelves
being brave as i was i volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after i was done <organization> could try
so people s jobs on computers working and learning
the violent winds at the top of the building would cause tethered dirigibles to swivel around and around the mooring mast
the library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us
the dirigibles usually moored in fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down
i know the mood is grateful because it says in paragraph <num> i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
making sure they would have a place to stay for sure <organization> asked the friend in charge of finding places to stay
a obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go
<percent> of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research
time went by slowly and we finally got on
i had no idea what i was in for
people worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age
if we could less to other serious problems
he motioned the other adults <caps> see what we were doing
my mother and father came to this country with such courage
at first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions he is in without any water
this skill could be used to pursue a good career in the carpentry field
another obstacle in attempting to get the dirigibles to dock was the wind
its just the culture you grew up in and <caps> of mind you are in that current time and place
some of my friends are patient but they cant wait as long as i can
they <month> not all mean harm towards me but towards other readers they could
i think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways
the parents were determined to make it to the united states because that was hard to do
since it was pitch dark she had the flash light with her
many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes agerelated material
the time i was patient is when it wast the first week of football
it is a whole different word now and it is a lot of old books and songs
they are both rated differently on levels of age
the <caps> times of laughter are what i valued and treasured so much that whenever i think about it i cant help but smile
the features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist
which proves to me the point that laughter and humor are two very important things in creating a bond between two people
images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation
for example say you have a turkey in the oven and your so in the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off
this is our future if we allow the censorship to continue
the time has come to decide
how would a library handle this situation
if everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf then there would be a little selection at the libraries
this is effecting people negatively
in conclusion the more you get to learn hot to use a computer the better handeye coordinated you will be
computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
this law made it illegal for people to land it up there
till i found out what she was doing i lost most of my trust with her
it was like it went through one ear out the other
as you interact with people on the computers
patience <caps> a sense of tolerance
these obstacles had made the builders face problems to allow dirigibles to land on the empire state building
on the to do i when my brother would let me use the play again
so that is my story about how i was patient
i guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing
<caps> that point <caps> was no going back <caps> what she had said
censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues
with the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back
computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world
we would just have so many good time just talking and laughing our time away
if a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home
the setting plays an important part in the authors mood
her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower she understood
any game you can think can probably be found on the <caps>
<caps> everyone is responsible
another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas
in such a diverse community it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf
another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas
this letter will effect others so thanks for reading
my dad and mom stayed to save our spots
the dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway from the back
the mast was doomed to fail before it began
so i worked for a couple of days as hard as i could and i only ended up with <num> lines
today in our society many things can be taken in many different way
my dad was very impatient
the features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desertlike temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting
it keeps you and healthy
the reality of the <time> was setting in
well i decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and i knew that she would have been there for me
then the biker listened and he went on down the road
<caps> get families get back on their feet
the author loves everything about this neighborhood
in the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town
the computers are ruining family connections
others say no for some reason why they say its not good for you and to addictive i clearly think that it is appropriate
reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication
when we were little it was watching <caps>
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast on the empire state building
i wonder if some books on endangered species of fish
this is an example of handeye coordination
it was about the civil war
when my parents fought i tried to keep my brother and sister busy but that never kept me busy
the only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it
i was at my door step
its how they wanted it to be written and nobody should get mad over that
this is the mood created in this excerpt
then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward
that purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast
the schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force
there would be a lot more wars
people should think about one another once in a while and not be so stuck on what they personally believe
materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole
your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward
these are the main obstacles of the empire state building to allow dirigibles to dock
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems that led to a plan failed
we had to drive for <num> hours straight
he had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause
everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into
one day i was feeling down and depressed
he loves his parents what they did for him
most people rather stay on the computer than spend time working out
movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes
another reason computers are good because they can keep you out of trouble and can keep you entertained
over vast changes of terrain
one you can use them for almost everything
we were gone for probably four hours
say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published
i was one of the last people off our bus which means i was one of the last to order
so it was illegal for an airship to be tied on a building
laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship
by having a computer you can boost your education
computers allow you to open up the to all people
<caps> feels very grateful for her parents strife to help her and for such an accepting neighborhood
when we are family laughs together i think that is the time when we actually communicate
the story of how laughter caused me to meet the love of <caps> life
even if things seem to take a turn for the worst
a library card is one thing a kid always looked forward to
i became very nervous as we walked to the front door
here are some reasons why you should get a computer for your family
this is the effect of library censorship
an obvious one was structural stability throughout the entire building
she will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country
the <organization> was almost like an elite club
these are all great uses for computers
so many teens read that book and found it interesting
some people think that people use computers too much
that just made us laugh even more
all my reasons before
many people say that computers are useful
you can slide in a <caps> and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it
what i mean by this is that we would pretty much be telling that person that they are not able to learn something new because others think its offensive
the first of the builders problems started with trying to prepare the actual building for the added stress that would be applied when having dirigibles try to dock
the music was always playing and family came a lot
the library could make a section called family and kids
some of the things that <month> be hard for cyclist are the rough roads
bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice
in this excerpt the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink
the author now had a solid thing to remind her of home
remember this next time you are someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time
the setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay
the languages in movies and music are not what we think they are
this poses a large problem for parents
people are just getting to fat from sitting and doing nothing all day
these facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bikeride
<percent> of people nowadays have at least one maybe two computers in their household
she herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see
these books appear unappealing and offensive
can when you would rather waste the computer other than outside and at least self
the computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or a rainyday
<person> was behind <caps> when she set the table down
now imagine what that does to your body
so there are many other was to dealing with censored items
they also had complications the captain of the dirigibles shell could not let go of the control levers
now what happens if the items are removed from the shelfs of libraries
this law made it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
there were six guys in my weight class and four of the six i have previously beaten in early season
<caps> is a lot of question if the book should be read in schools or not because of the nword
it was <date> and <person> communist regime was ruling new <location>
that would take to long to do so though
it seamed like we would never get there it was not the best experience
we both together can share a laugh
in one case a girl actually killed because of nasty messages posted about her
a bad thing about <caps> the computer i can do is bringing up a virus
the mood created by the author is welcoming
these are only a few ways i was patient
so she had to take it off
i feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer
the less time people spend outside the more energy is being wasted
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
would they just be able to take it off the shelf
this <caps> proves how its likely to destroy the whole entire empire state with fire
i also had to be patient my birthday this year because i knew i was getting cool stuff but i never imagined it would this cool
i know what the feeling is when you are low of fluids because l have chronic dehydrated
the barn was unlike any other
i tried getting her to eat but <caps> would only puke it back up
this is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public libraries
it is the thing that has helped me make new friends
he might have been very frustrated but he just stayed calm and looked forward to meeting <person>
possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom
changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it
i am one of those thinkers
we were now at minute <num>
then they say about <num> cars
that is just a few way that setting could harm you
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i hope i have shown you as an independent person my statement was true
i just told you why i think a good laugh is a good thing in a relationship
he wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream
i love them very much
and i want on <organization>
lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family
farmers <month> need to keep reports on their money income
the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive
on a computer all you can do is watch and even that is nothing compared to the real thing its just a snapshot of it
the variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation
i stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter
<person> reached into his pocket an pulled out his cell
and then we have no books left for any of us
you just have to know when enough is enough
this shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle
the music you listen to has a huge impact on your life
no one can blame the authors
for the rest of ride there i was pretty quiet
you how useful a computer can do
my mom stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital so things around the house was a little bit different
whenever <caps> would joke around with me i would take <caps> all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things i thought <caps> would hate me forever
then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i was literally mortified
we put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone
he told them this is a free country i can do what ever i like and whites liked that he spoke up for his self
but the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water
the <caps> also spoke about his parents and there life
now lets just think about this for a moment
at the end of the day the <location> ended up winning
i was <caps> confused
the innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery
while you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time
i recently received a <caps>
also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights
i <caps> and ended up opening the one <caps> shook for real
i was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for <num> minutes
not only did it bring us literally closer together but it started our amazing friendship
it is the best way to relax
also in paragraph <num> the author says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
all of the contributing obstacles the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles unsuccessful
no two people think the same
a computer can store what you learn too
in my opinion it is but only to a certain extent
the use of computers especially has skyrocketed
recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends
they have many different kinds of books for specific reasons
the group was called <organization>
i saved this kittens life with my cure for cancer
the answer is most likely going to be a yes
l could drop from a heatstroke
he is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on
it is fun because you are not bored
when negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits
or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught
i hope i can achieve that too
<caps> was all very fun and entertaining but no matter what we did <organization> had something to say about every little thing we did or saw
i hope that you will too
my <caps> <date> got real stressed real fast
i think the libraries should be broken onto sections
maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper
when i grow up and soon get out of high <organization> i want to travel all over the world
now thats my choice to do all of that
open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights
you need your daily intake of oxygen
i laughed hysterically the rest of the car ride home
a library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want
my neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as <caps>
some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place
i think that there should be no censoring of libraries
these are other examples why i think computers are positive
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
so that is a time when i showed patients
i think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us
shes saying there always a second chance
<caps> timing <caps> i replied with a tone of anger in my voice
i was happened to wait another <date> <date> so <date> <date> came again
the geese are going to always come back
books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people
the map would have been a lot safer and easier
the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast
hes very proud of his parents for the risk that they took for him
now that is one long story about patience
its just that simple
also as stated in paragraph <num> the u
it is very hot as the cyclist is riding
after <num> minutes we still did not get the jackets yet
this would cause the back of the dirigible to sway and move about
in everyday of our live we see something new that comes out and becomes an easy tool for us
are maybe really good books
the risk of any of these things happening is very high
i also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this
these subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
personally i think that there should be a variety in the library
a material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people
a complete citizens and drives them from family and friends
this word search was kind of funny <caps> only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny
an hour passed no doctor
these encounters create an interesting meal
when people talk to each other via text message or email there is no emotional sense
i really had my funny best friends back
a lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow
and finally an hour in line
i got a little better every day
with the way things are today its almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence
they taught him to always lend a helping and and to alway keep his door open
<caps> a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read
they help people of all ages
patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do
the easy access to the library is part of the problem
i yelled as <caps> and i began the process
kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad
i can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at
on <date> i was with my dad at <num> am
on the front was my name in marker
in the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win
then one of them started to play with the ball popper
so computers do have a good point to it
you could also make lots of new friends by going out doors
when we got home everybody was waiting at the door
its quick easy and it works
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there
the authors mood that he wanted you to feel was that your family and house was loving
i think that you should have a positive way on computers too
there were so many obstacles to moor dirigibles on the empire state building
this contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water
the second reason i think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music
families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen
unfortunately the reality in successfully completing this far reached destination was slim as problems gradually arose
often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics
i think the best placed to start is the beginning
i mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy
being that there is one computer in the house i have to wait
i reminded him that once we got to <organization> we would go on all the rides that we want
that was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away
to wrap this up i would just like to say thank you <caps> having the time to read my letter
in conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power
i think i might be a little to patient seeing today <caps> <date> and the dance <caps> tonight
when my family was planning our trip to <organization> in <location> we used the computer constantly
the libraries are public for a reason
now <caps> use computers to organize lesson plans and print out reminders for their students
i do not think censoring is really necessary
he would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that
and in a world where its more important than ever to do
thats a day i would never forget from laughter
the have different website that play video of things that are funny
these skills <month> be needed in their job field
throughout the story workers of the empire state building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
the next example of how the features and the settings
laughter is so very important to a persons health
she symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past
you should be with your family and and friends
this is the mood expressed in the memoir
some parents <month> feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them
it is what makes the workers to the procrastinators and the fit to the lazy
showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus
it kind of worked but once in awhile it came back to me
it was a normal old boring day in the <date> but i had just got a call from my sister in law
also it means you experience difficulties without complaining
we just got together with them and acted as if <caps> had happened
but people need to get out more
there was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a city
all the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble
meeting new people is a good thing to <caps>
when i have an essay to do i always use the computer first
computers are used by many people to interact with another
as he was growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
we got the address and took off again for our search
there are so many thing that you would be missing out on
laughter can turn a bad day completely around
two years have passed since <person> mom had left
for example the author said i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
plus computers help people make money
if these offensive things were not aloud to be showed i personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents
because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
for example if i wanted to i could talk to someone and the <caps> and clean my room
but they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine
we knew each other much better and finally had things to talk about and we found out we had something in common
then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride
over <money> worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
and my last reason is because you can send messages to a far away place by using email
if you say good for you
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
this is the mood <person> creates in the memoir
who has forgotten about the past
shortly after <person> had to leave
i believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head
many people in <location> use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things
i was young myself and i had experienced this too at one point
censoring books could take away from learning
it was the day i was going to have my <caps> party
<caps> thing the memoir said was i learned the real definition of family
they could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers
the <caps> is so much faster and the articles are more up to date
it also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world
so they only had little pay to feed there family
i agree with those experts because many people take the computer serious and always want to be on
then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced
at the grocery store <organization> helps her <caps> shop
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
i am about to tell you and that time
another main obstacle as stated in paragraph <num> was nature the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
what better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences
i strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in
next reason is computers make life better
just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not also
my mom was well freaking out
i went to go talk to my dad about my pool idea
so when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves
this is why i support the computer
i think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home
there is magazines but i think they are boring
in the last sentence of the memoir he says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
we all got dressed into warm clothes to go out an go snowmobiling
all of these can lead to different things like going or
a library has to be the worst place for people not liking things
but we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone
it would also cost a lot more money to call
another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas
during the <date> my family and i went to <location> for a couple weeks
these are the moods the memoir created
these are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version
i think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want
even though me and my dad were mad at each other its a memory that will carry on with me forever
unfortunately they my momma and my sisters had to go
that they now go on the computer
lastly you <caps> basically do anything on a computer
last reason of why i think computers are useful is that they help you get a hold of family and friends
it would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries
i laugh along with them
this is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing
this is <caps> final reason why i was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer
those are so examples of how <person> changed the mood thought out him memoir
the girlinblack said that <caps> is stupid
you can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead
my last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment
most people have there own type of everything
so i did i went to tell him
i have lived in a lot of different
that is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance
it seems as though there was not enough space due to the dirigible being so long
why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country
that was one time that i should patience
this means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to
as in paragraph <num> the greatest reason was safety
people could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library
i believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long
this is much like how our libraries are becoming
to give their children a better life
that night we went out for dinner at <organization>
<caps> he said that <person> started running around acting like a pig
that is why i think the computer has a great effect on people
racism is a very hurtful thing
he talks about the love for the people and things in his life that he cares about
and i remember siting there being as patient as i could waiting for a deer to step within range
so i think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into it each day
these are some of the major obstacles the architects faced
if everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure
in this wasted time you could be out going for a jog or walking the day
the flash pass takes you to the front of the line
a second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was <caps> high that there were strong wind currents
also all of these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the buildings framework better
i laugh so much sometimes that my side and stomach hurts so bad
he is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present day life
he weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
some experts are concerned about people using computers and not enjoying nature and going outside
without them it would take double to triple the amount of time to do something without them
they teach us new things and help us with handeye coordination
we the <organization> believe are children and adults are spending too much time in their laptops or computers
everyone started laughing again
i looked over at the clock to see how i was doing on time
and even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present
if no one laughed the world would be a terribly sad place
but no one left till ten
these books do contain language that is not appropriate for children
that is what i know about laughter
today it seems like the world is held together by technology and i think computers are at number one
ninety percent of the time that i do that my grades go up and i get a satisfying grade
while he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water
some kids like listening to music while reading
this is one very important reason student use computer to research projects
it can help kids get their information about the person they are writing about in their report
computers are a waste of money
there could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
<percent> of parents who took a poll in <organization> say they want their children to learn about different cultures
there are rooms that have been never opened to public and is the highest observation desk
they help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about
one of those major obstacles was the frame work
the average <caps> spends <num> hours on the computer everyday
i understand a parents concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate
both anticipating my snap
although many people still should laugh whenever they want
after she took the test she was very nervous
websites that are selling stolen merchandise
at first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground
this shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started
little did i know i had just hit a random little kid in the back of the head
this memoir is basically about how grateful the author is to his parents
it was a lot of fun seeing my brother try new things and have fun with it
i think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons
these relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life
thank you for reading this and i hope i persuaded you enough with my reasoning
they got along great and were very happy they had each other
but we were not in <location>
now you would think that going camping would be for bringing the family together and having fun
and <num> extra pair of clothes after that we were as our way to the hotel and ready to go to <caps> adventure that next morning
you get a lot more attention when you have that trust with other people
first it started out when i got a can from my friend <person> he asked me to go
i would let him read it to learn about the past
the less i thought about it the faster time passed by
it took a ton of patients
from the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips
it took a lot of work
they would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever
the content of a library should be full of various material even if one <month> find certain materials offensive
as we finished eating a mother came along with her baby boy
the main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships
welcome <location> just sit down i will be with you shortly the teacher says
by computers letting people easily access tools that help us gain knowledge can become more advanced in many of our lives
i had to baby sit my cousin <caps> while his room pack up cause they were making back to <location>
the features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water
id never seen people act this way
the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
have good eyes and enjoy nature
it is the adults responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers
every time she hears me laugh she laughs and tries to make me laugh so that she can laugh and we all have a good time
the music should be censorship some what like with rap
i was getting myself into
can be offensive to others
<caps> were both really surprised that i said that and became intimidated
so i came back down and i landed on my back and the angle i was at on the trampoline shot me off
put a <num> and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have <caps> just to solve the age problem
these are all things that parents want to keep away from their children in order to keep them safe
just as they are today in our local library
finding a way to reach a happy medium
that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us
when i see him i am happy and my toes curl
a sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen
this is not always good
you will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map
censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it <caps> wrong
while the cyclist was riding it was very hot
and we froze but we held in there until the <num> game was over
immediately i decided to lighten the dank feeling in the room by starting a name game
to like or hate what ever is on the shelves
for example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run
that is why i think computers are necessary
the terrain affect the character by keeping him determined
the nature and wildlife is much more important
we had a total of three <caps> for everyone
i would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community
many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
i was helping my grand ma can
<caps> was not afraid to displease the <location>
writing is a way to express ones thoughts and ideas on a page
that made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigibles load
i think the use of computers is very good things in the present day <location>
the first reason why is that most spend their time social networking
winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist
for this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner
this being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material
there is no reason to only sell what you like
i know it was being rude to laugh at him but i loved spending time with him
the mood created by the author is a grateful mood
the vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational
my grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house
i learned this when i was little
i think it has a positive affect
books can be very educational
she felt bad for me and asked the boys name
after she got done laughing she ask me for my phone number and then that night we started dating
my door will always be open
some music has to much bad language in it
a very big problem they faced was safety
i had not really noticed or even heard him talk
even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of mans imagination
these obstacles destined the mooring mast to never fulfill its purpose
they can learn and even interact with
thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
if you are a shy person this can help you
i think its all right to have movies too
so we had to be patient too
in the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak
she was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes
its just easier to move on and forget it
<caps> it was decided
i knew if i had not been patient i would not have made it on the long journey to <location>
these books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know
movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces
with little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist
then with in two days there would be not books left
you would hop on a computer and check it out
computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends
we packed out for the rest of the night
this portrays the mood of friendship and caring because although they are not blood family
the builders have a hard time constructing the dirigibles
i myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries
one <month> raise the question of these books possibly invoking violence
the better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it
but if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem
there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas
i was <num> years old and i was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office
also the law against airships flying to low over urban areas
here lies the problem
censorship should be practiced everywhere
the final practice was cut short so that the team could create tiedye tshirts to wear at the tournament
i snorted at <caps> <caps> said
books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got
if the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read
the cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight
<location> relationship was very bad
and it was <num> times better and free and better
i was now soaked laying there a gooey green monster
i think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature
i asked each of the kids how long it took them
now i can understand why our schools library <month> not be so fond of carrying books with racy aspects to them
my friend <person> bought a computer game last week
these ratings help censor things to a certain extent
their are many mood set by the author of this memoir
every one has the choice
she will be here soon
having laughter in life makes the world <caps> round
i will take that test again
i agree with the computers helping people
another example can be a book
<caps> went shopping and <caps> got rewarded for being patient
so that took about <num> min
if you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time
in the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life
all you have to do is talk to him
you email coworkers about jobs
the morning dawned to be gray and rainy
going outside and getting fresh air
we were both in a mud pit
that they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through
so i turned on the radio and fell asleep
in this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is
this is causing kids to become less active
my brother and i were right behind them and our parents were no where in sight
the parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading
i cant choose <caps> they are both understandable
this is how kids are helped out by computers
its nothing like being said
none of us were even close to smiling
and the way we obtain this knowledge is through media
thank you and have a great day
was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
she first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings
the obstacles for the builders also became much more dangerous as they began to realize the science of the dirigibles
letting out the last prolonged scream i pointed down to my crotch
some can get obese and mess with your love life
<person> is very grateful throughout the memoir
people today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive
it will make your day that much better
computers have helped todays life for a few different reasons
if people can share a laugh it can bring them together
many people thought is was right
all the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly
since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be amazing thing to another person
another obstacle the builders faced was most dirigibles from outside of the u
i do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf
computers can give you the answer to any question
i was doing a waterdepleting <num>
the <caps> line is that computers are very helpful
after they figured out what could go wrong if they docked dirigibles the original purpose of the mast was not able to be fulfilled
he loved where he came from
say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army
we sat in line a hour and half for this to happen
it was once said you can not know your present without knowing your future
the objects we are talking about are our entertainment it brings us joy and many smiles
a survey was set up by the <caps> foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and <percent> said yes
we were walking home yesterday
all of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible
we just stared at him
when we drive to <caps> i have to be patient
its as simple as that
we can only hope for the best
another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes
these books are too old for a elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading
being patient con get you very far in life
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
finally parents can set limits on what their own children read
my second reason is to have a job in the computer business
safety was the main problem
i guess it was just in the way she said i saved her life
laughing is a magical feeling that goes through out your body and makes you feel warm inside
its been a few months and we have only become greater friends
the use of lead weights to way down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create
one problem was safety
he also like to give them hi fives after they are done playing
well you can thank and global warming for that
certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries
so knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the <date>
i have to input that i personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours past
then took them home and showed them to the hole town
but there is always a age group thats not suppose to read some books
this could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings
another breathtaking adventure that you <month> miss out on is hiking
the <caps> that <caps> sister an i went through that day was all over after the laughter <caps> father gave us
you have to mete <caps> fun
people reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others
laughter is something that is there when you are happy
people are concerned
that was a really fun memory i have with lots of laughter and good times
so in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects
you can be playing a game and still chat
you cannot reword whats been written
i started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force i was putting on my it which maid me to stop laughing
that book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life
if not for solely learning but for reference
my heart was sad for the poor girl because i knew <caps> needed a friend
computers are a great source of information
they thought <caps> was hilarious
people will like you a little more if your patient
they see an older kid fighting and they want to try it out
they are either working or playing
in those <num> months we wanted a house neat to a patch of works and a fresh water <date>
i think the top level or a certain area should be the adult area
because she says when the snow melts and the geese return
then when spring comes and it blooms the flower could give her the strength to pass the test
but when we got there we found out we had to wait <num> hours until the plane left and wed be on our way to <location>
they live in cold water so it took about <num> hours
so all this puts affect on him from just whats around him
as said in paragraph <num> the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency
that made us realize that we were a lot alike
a computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds
<caps> walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter
that can be really hard
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
all during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family
its a new time and age and things are different
<caps> made me feel beautiful
after a while <organization> was standing by the <caps> and <caps> dad jumped out and scared <organization>
this could very well be the poll your <caps> took
i will have to be patient
people write books all the time dealing with something that has happened in their lifetime or something from their imagination
she left at <time> and me and my sister just ate breakfast now we are going to go swimming
giving the first peddle i fell and hit the ground extremely hard
she hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test
this shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was
i went to the barber shop was packed so the guy that cut my hair told me i was next in the chair
<caps> asked if i wanted to study the bible with him
a few months ago i was at the local library searching for the perfect book
this is my last reason why i think computers have a positive effect on people
censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually
if a dirigible was to hit it it would pop the dirigible and kill many people below
the dirigible would constantly be moving around
everything was going fine
in about two seconds you should have fantastic results
also many laws <caps> airships flying low in urban areas
i was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because i love writing and competition
now a days instead of bitting the gym many people are home on the computer talking to friends or playing computer games
<caps> also gives me <caps> about a <caps> college that i would <caps> and like to attend to
this law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
many people are affected negatively by computers
so to boost her confidence she decides to plant it
the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose
the dirigibles ran on hydrogen verses helium and if it were to ever to catch on fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger
thats not fair in <location>
she tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice
it is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships
this is where the conflict begins
the third reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas
that was the time when i was patient
i guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because <caps> began to giggle
everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it
all of this can be done in about <num> minutes or less
he began to ride again
more than <percent> <date> people in the world have computers
after i was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own
well you cannot blame the library for having the book
the computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool
categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some <caps> from viewing harmful materials
the answer to that is through our history
<caps> talked about her life as being very nice because <caps> grew up in a house that turned into a home
i think this would be a good start on making the world happier and bringing all of us closer together
the author concluded the story like that because she was being positive
we got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together
soon i realized it was about <num> p
she walked up to the ticket booth and cut everyone in line
for the interacting with friends and family you can do that i mean how long can a person look at a computer screen
my dad <person> is patient everyday
i was now helping keep people up the ladder
i got onto one of the main roads and headed to <organization>
not the <percent> who sit at the computer all day writing reply
that was the time i was patient
other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families
their easy access and very helpful
now that you know that lets move on to my first reason
it degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves
another problem was the building had to be strong enough to hold a blimp in place
the speaker also shows happiness
using led weights to secure the back would not be safe or practical
<caps> all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation
it was unsafe for planes
another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast
laughing says a lot without saying a word
patience is important
during all of this i was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at
it says in the bottom of paragraph <caps> that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made
libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow
if you use the computer it might break or not work properly
<person> dad got another pull on his line
our opinions should not be based on a persons dislike of something
computers can help you with as well
he has trouble finding a place to get water
it gave birth to the muchused computer
<caps> need to do this honey
the thing that i had to be so patience about was that we were going to have <caps> there so i wanted to open my presents
this would be neither practical nor safe
this could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here
he was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback
i know this because in paragraph <num> the author writes i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible <date> decades <date>
this faster finish can lead to kids not staying up too late
everyone should have some relationship
a specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries
not everything is decided by me
computers are making that happen quicker
no action was funny or a friend saying something <caps> because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy
high winds could cause problems when the dirigibles are trying to dock
so as i assumed he got the bike stuck and since i was the only one with him i had to help him get the bike unstuck
it is a season of birth and growing
if we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost
we had fights like that on and off and thing with my family and his family made it vary hard for us to be together
the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
computers have a great effect on people
then i had to wait two and half hour just for him to get one shone on
you can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events
and even help you with your job
the rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them
he was running a muck just <caps> for a phone call
i came back <time> and <caps> was gone
that might even be how it will stay
<person> and i had almost stepped on a dead snake that was laying in the lane
my stomach was hurting and i was hungry
not to mention that all around was a densely populated city and any accident could cause much more destruction than normal
this is much easier than calling the person
it was worth waiting <num> and a half hours <organization> it and we even went on it twice
it shows me that they can smile and not some stuck up want to be perfect robot
there are <num> features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey
my goal is to be able to make people smile <caps> they are down
as <caps> continues through the passage it says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help
another day went by and my mom finally called them
the setting affected the cyclist in several ways
this is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
i think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people
but here is where they go wrong
they should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room
that is exactly what i plan to do
all of these things can help you in a way
well of course she said yes
the final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air
the author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself
for me to have fun on
i stammered walking back home
thats what i think about people trying to take the books off the shelf
age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material
he has learned the definition of family and know what a family is like and he respects his family for having a great home in <location>
when we got to the entrance <caps> said a fortyfive minute wait so we got in line and the ride broke down for over three hours
we walked and talked and he took pictures of everything
they could afford nothing else
<caps> <person> of the international health committee
according to the last sentence were <person> says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
i will have it done in <num> minutes
not just one genre a person wants
after all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have
this child that is telling the story is telling about the happy things in their life
<caps> is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers <num>
each night as i left i could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having
i was siting down in my seat
the author <month> love having people wonder about whats coming next
while using a computer you can also talk to people
people think that we should hide things that are offensive to other people
a third problem was nature and the weather
it was the winds on top of the building were contently shifting due to violent air currents
i believe that censorship is a very debatable subject for many
we love to hang out and be together
one of the original purposes of the empire state building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps
those are some obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
many of these books have images of how do this and that
so for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction
<caps> is fun in itself
while on this wonderful adventure of learning you <month> even get yourself into a vacation adventure
i remember when <person> first came to this school she look like the other girls in our class but once we got to know her we became best friends
another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him
laughing lights up everything smiling makes people happy and it feels comforting
small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it
i hang out a lot at her at her house and we share so many great and fun memories
computers are horrible when it comes to this topic
whether those reasons be personal or professional it rather important
another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch
it can teach you something and help you
its there choice to read it not mine
you can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country
i think their new slogan should be is we have a better learning company than anyone else
she will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring
i do not remember anything bad in it
theres more adult books than little kids books
everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either
but instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it
how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area
i believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children
the fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad
we all agreed that <caps> was a great plan and we would all have a wonderful <caps>
we would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on <caps>
freedom comes in disc and books but it is still <location> middle name and the birth right to our future
this little vow to herself was a message to not give up
finding out later they an existing law about airships flying to low which would make it illegal for a dirigible to even fly near the empire state building
those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends
they do not understand that what they do <month> not be a good thing
experts even say how computers change the way they act at home and in the public
reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing
when we got outside we saw my dad had introduced himself to <caps>
this is the mood created by the author in the memoir
most of the zeppelins from places besides the u
the other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it
the author also gives off a very compassionate mood
examples like finding things out about history
what harm could it cause to see it now
thank you for your time
so today i am going to go swimming then going to go on a hike then finally my friends can come over and the party we start
your comfortable person could even be your future spouse
by doing this we can learn what life is like for them
the man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy
it shows her getting used to the new home
the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons
this can lead to death
because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them
the computer is also fun and easy to use
so <location> newspaper i hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great
books that have questionable content are being thrown out
tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part
this quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them
i said in my morning voice
the smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze
this is very urgent situation so please be aware
this should never happen to todays literature
sitting around like a couch is not healthy
<person> chased <person> across the yard
we need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching
a computer many family thing
no one wants the truth cut out of their reading materials
i had been off of school now for <num> weeks and i had did everything i wanted to do
patience is being understanding and tolerant
their greatest reason was one of safety for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city
all of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water
the obstacles that builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences
on the whole i feel society would be better off without computers
d should be asked for
lastly people can learn about where their family corner form
i was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible
the odds are extremely unlikely
i was starting to get mad
i know i do it all the time
also the builders had to take into account the fact most dirigibles
he talks about how he grew up and his parents took people in that needed support and helped them out
there were a few obstacles builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i thought to myself i wonder i wonder if i pushed enough i wonder if i messed up to much
the garbagecan was as full as a stuffed <location> on <caps>
i used the computer in the dark so now i need contacts
you look back and regret doing what you did
i think our society babies us a little to much because when we get out into the real world things are not going to be censored or kept quiet
i was proud of myself after i was done riding my new <caps>
but people would kill for these games
the <caps> obstacle would be the wind
another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it
this shows the generosity of his parents and the author is trying to create a loving mood
no one could express love the way we do now
safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station
everyone one was taking the mud off of <caps> and i then put it on them selfs
well while i was being happy and my big sisters were getting thing together for my party my mom was at work
censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views
the hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter
<caps> items are all over society
these materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned
such as how many points <person> got for your fantasy team
people have the right to know everything
as my brother and i look back at this experience we laugh about it and make jokes
<caps> was the first <date> in <date> and l was eating lunch
<organization> blew my mind the first time i seen her
music everybody has there on type of music you cant just start taking music of because you think its offensive
computers are way to burdens of work
computers have a positive effect on people because they are very helpful
com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play
tears came down face face for how hard i was laughing
nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused
so a computer hacker or a fraud site cant steal my personal info
this is what happiness really is
one decision is to either buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one in a little bit
the computer is able to do so many things
no one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them
people can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer
everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions
the amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere
children that are not in school or in the early stages of school
also i would not care if i had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me
all in all we cannot get extinguish the flames of our past or we <month> never have a future
but with all <money> this technology we still need to find a balance
in this piece the features were determined how the cyclist felt
finally it makes you more social
media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do
after that day we stayed connected we had long hour conversations through this video calling site called <organization>
in <date> society not everyone has the time to go to he library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in
i know this because <caps> talks about his family and friends and his <caps>
laughter could mean so many different things
their families love turned the house into the home he loves
i know a lot of people who love it though
computers help you physically but they can help you mentally as well
the geese drive at coming back again during the spring and the main character drives at passing the test
i know i would feel bad
did you know that <percent> of our jobs in the <organization> is mostly about using a computers
this kept us active and enjoy the environment
the people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others
using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time
the last crazy event of the night was the <caps> <caps> <caps>
i think that they should put some books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will like
if we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything
they supermarket for you
every person should have that right
but computers open up a realm of possibilities
my mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always do
after our laughing was under control she helped me get up and we went to go find our agriculture teacher <person>
i find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they cant be denied informing others about that religion
many people use computers in their every day life
in the memoir it says that the parents let friends and family stay with them until they got back on their feet
parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve
so <person> was wise in her observation
i believe books should be censored by content much like movies
a life without laughter is a life not spent
one of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building
all a sudden out of <caps> where my cousin <person> farts
the obstacles faced by the empire state building builders were
i agree that this benefits society
being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you not being rude
<caps> <person> went on helping all of the other students and i was waiting and waiting
these were some elements that effected the rider on his trip
the workers building the empire state building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there
this affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat
computers made communication easy for anyone
if a child wants to read a book they should have every right to read that book
that look she gave me like fire burning in her eyes with love
i am clearly in favor of owning and using computers
i was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm
some teens think its okay just because the characters in the book are doing it then its okay for them and their significant other to try it
the last major concern is located in paragraph nine
there are things like books that talk about sex
that they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news
it seems like it is taking for ever
finally the last reason would be safety
yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home
we can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer
the speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean
they want to dock the dirigibles at the empire state building
just think about the feeling of never ending laughter
its just like judging a person for their race
for example in paragraph <num> he says things began well enough
i always have a great time and now i wait patiently for next year
i realized that my children will be telling bad jokes
this can later help you in sports when you get out and exercise
so she told me she was going to <organization>
how would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves
using computers is very time consuming
what he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too
in the <num> paragraph it mentions all the sacrifice that his parents took to get their family to <location>
after i had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more
violent air currents
it is a very communist thing to do
now i had to keep my patience though because who would yell at a baby
these life of can also become dangerous
the obstacles of it was nature itself
mom said rushing over to me
it always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining
he had no choice but to continue with his the journey
in all of our lives there is that one person that is so special you would never do anything to hurt them
the author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year
the mood created by the author is in the memoir
one obstacle that the builders faced was safety
most dirigibles outside the u
i believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future
all in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific books
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
under standing in patience means you know why you have to stand their waiting
the issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see
the computer through keep you in touch
it was taking a long time for them to cook
he says he is grateful for the spirit an generosity given to him by his parents at a young age
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
all of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football
for some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material
but after the long line
the mood set in this home is friendly and inviting
this is why i think computers are very positive
or to learn about places that you never been to before or would like to vacation to
we had to wait about fifteen minutes this time
with computers that number goes down into the thousands
this mood is a mix of many things
he says in the story the speed limit was <num>
there are some books that some people find so offensive that they can not even continue to read the rest of the book
the mood that came was loving and that tingling feeling of hope
my mother parked the car at the nearby park and my sisters ran ahead of us to the carnival
the builders of the empire state building were faced with many different obstacles
blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too
the first reason why libraries should not be censored is so they will not lose business
computers discourage exercise cut down the number <organization> hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste <organization> money and space
the last to boys showed up now
seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people
it is not necessary to take the items off the shelf
soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t
thats literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life
while they are reading the book opens there mind to much more then what they are used to and normally around everyday
i was anxiously sitting there waiting to take my test and thats when they called my number
you can go on <caps> and watch funny videos or go on <caps> and on you friends new photo album
here are some ways how
it would have been better to have aid it to her face but i know i would have chickened out if i did it face to face
but no matter how you look at it
having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away
in that smile i saw a real person smiling at me with real pleasure showing through
it would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
what could have taken months by letters in the mail took as little as one hour to do over the <caps>
as my sisters are now done and we are in the car we can finally get off to <location>
that is the final reason of why i think the mood of the memoir is a loving mood
censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it
another problem was safety
the steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe
they had to do what they thought was best for their children
it was my first game
laughter is good for every one
all we need to do is to is remember not to forget
thats one obstacle of building docking areas
i had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her
one problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium
if we do not have technology then we can not call no one
he no longer had that much water
also he is a great man
all the laughing made me forget that i was sad in the first place
everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people
i was curious <caps> i cracked the car door open <caps> i can hear a little better about what they were saying
everything was how it normally was on <date> <time>
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
many times have i been in an awkward position that i have used laughter to free myself from discomfort
in that economy its really hard to find a job
in the song it also makes fun of gay people
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
they also have toys down there for kids so if there parents want to go upstairs then the kids can sit there and play with the toys
no good comes from hiding it
some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive
<person> was all i replied to all of them who stared at me the entire time
my mom went to the font desk to tell them i was there
people also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive
there is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer
the <num> day would be the hardest of there all
were run on hydrogen rather than helium
computers are also in some electronics
putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society
and with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes
another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds
i believe that the viewer should have a family members consent to view said content
but we also have the option to eat outside on our porch
<caps> we went to the <organization>
this was a time when i had been patient
keep on reading so i could tell you all about my three reasons
but self control is the only way to avoid this problem
also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings
<num> days before my birthday i would not eat
i try to do my best in school until <date> arrives
if people wish to express themselves by reeding it then they have that right
so this is why <caps> effects education
so she is not being pressured into taking it
so by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again
there should be age limits on books
they give you bad ones to careful when your on a computer
<caps> mother recently got surgery on her shoulder
we go inside the doctors room and i sit down he does all this things
when kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing
this cyclist seemed to have bad wick
your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with
the biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired
people have the right to say how they feel by any medium
he made the memoir and nice and passionate
the next obstacle the builders faced was nature
so i think they should change it around
when i had to <caps> patient one of my most memorable time when
also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home
<person> can recall the time when the trails <caps> runs were overrun with people
<caps> you want to be know for destroying an important part of history
so we all started laughing and then i got a chain out of the back of my truck and pulled him back over
in conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea
censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians
he looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages
with out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell
i asked wondering if it would easy to get it
he was starting to go a little crazy
i remember it all clear as glass ice
the builders of the empire state building faced a myriad of obstacles
why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in
i believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with
thank you for accepting my <caps>
the loss of books has been seen throughout history
but the computer all of that to society
i recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is <caps>
another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus
it can even take a project on a flash drive and then download it
i feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off
i do mean he loves to sing
being a new student is never easy
i sit down anxious to get up and move again
the winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged
my parent got out of line so they could get a drink
i think all these things affect him
my friend and i have been going on adventures since the third grade
it seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother
everyone knows computers addictive
she decided when it will spring with hibiscus budding she will start her new life by giving the test again and providing her self how important hibiscus
they have their views and opinions and are entitled to them as well
nature was a factor because of the high winds
this clearly possessed a problem bigger than the empire state building could withstand
buy things without having to go to the store
but not the kind i was used to
i came out with cuts and bruises but that was <caps>
the dirigibles would swivel around because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
she told us loud and clear to serve the ball to spots one and five <caps>
another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels <num> degrees
these media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives
it can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts
that is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase
just as the way his parents were to other immigrants
it will make good times even better and never be forgotten
i knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times i had with one true my best friend
the second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles
<caps> had a bunch of tubes to climb in and a slide and running wheel
the author creates a grateful mood
now its possible to learn about life in <location> first hand
<percent> of kids spend <num> to <num> hours on the computer
maybe the parent should even just come in and get the book or movie for the child
growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
which means the whole community can go pick out something
fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire
if there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future
safety was a concern
and i say no to computers
this is a story about patience
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i am against any material that are offensive to someone or something else
or not all day on the computer
with this program you will never forget where you have to go
when i got here i met <person>
his mother and father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge or the culture
we started to date in the <num> grade
its too much of a pain to keep everything on files
these two quotes show the love that the authors parents showed towards their children
like a movie some people like to see things to understand them
and thats how he had that strange dream
wanting to help me out rather then embarrass me
another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the empire state building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas
<caps> was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park
then <person> though to herself i got to be patient
the workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location
thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family
the theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings
computers could also help us with our every day life
the second girl was right
it was like a whole mall in one little store
we have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read
that is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world
also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store
i was proud of being patient
it was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me
formed the backdrop to life in our warm home
the cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water
they each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written
this crushed me how was i suppose to reply to this
new styles they make more money they make
this shows that the speaker was creating a tone of gratefulness
laughing makes the bad days manageable and the great days fantastic
if the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in <location> will as well
all the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and friendship
i find that laughter is the key to having a close relationship with people
so authors have freedom to write what they would like to
another obstacle the builders faced was the violent air currents
some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves
i promised myself to go once i was able to drive myself regularly
it makes a person feel better
a time when i am patient
there are websites that help you find people
the tumble weeds show a distinct desert look
<caps> mom me and my brother said in unison
this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
it was about an hour in i fell asleep in the back seat
it is also not another persons right to decide what other people can and cannot observe
thats for my bike so
we had a great time there
you can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself
me and my friends we were going to a <caps> party at our dance coaches work
leaves and see these wide bunch of hills
they had to give up their job and skills they already knew how to do for better things
i knew that <person> went to the same church
same thing with trains
you can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government
i got off phone <caps> aunt was up she came into the room i told her what i knew
we were all very kind of sad but it was okay
computers are a big part of the working society today
the demonstration of how important my friends and family are
people having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people
social networks such as <caps> and <caps> allow that
it shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you
these were some of the obstacles the builders of the <organization>
i remember when my family and i all went out to eat for dinner one night
works of literature are just one of them
schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil
for one to complain about a books contents automatically give someone else the right to protect the books contents
the walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter
it would be a boring world
the safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable
the dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely
he described this with sentences like rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain
parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children
her gaze drifted down to the palms of my hands
he had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth
my doctor was very peaceful
my coach had to be the funniest person that i have ever met in my life
my dad drove me home
yet not one of us cared
the reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents moving the end of the blimp
my whole family except my dad was watching <caps>
the computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology
you need to be healthy and most of all active
she had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around
the world would not survive with out laughter
they can all help you you have been looking for
she shows she is motivated in many ways
they would be the kind of people who uses the computer or a different electronic a lot
in the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist
its depends on ones beliefs and morals
even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader
it could give me bragging rights i figure i need some hope and patience
this research can be used to write essays in school
another was the dangers they could inflict to civilians
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i let go falling into a pool
this is another reason computers are an impact
i am going to talk about what i think patience is
safety played a large role in the building of the empire state building
computers it the more advanced technology so its <caps> the people is using it
i was so patient i got <num> fish that day
being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble
i believe they will be in all of our homes
a fancy popcorn machine rested in the back of the room
many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place
they did so much for the author
today kids are so addicted to computers everyday they are on them
i woke up <date> <time> and figured it would be just another day
the frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible
can be considered offensive to someone
more kids are becoming over weight everyday
after all no one wants to hang out with someone who is always negative and only looks at the bad things
another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself
from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium
your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated
<person> looked off into space
every body cheered and chanted because won by two points
these are the obstacles that the builders faced in attempting dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
she was very patient
literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture
it takes a long time to cook cookies
nobody can tell a book is going to be inappropriate just by looking at the front cover
whether its for work or the one keeping in touch with a relative
when i read this memoir i felt happy reading it
the elements were against him
we must prevent this at any way possible
i also wanted to take you to the other side without computers
i was so proud of my cousin
another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from
stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week
<person> then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends
laughter can not only be a benefit to ourselves but to others as well
my dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors
i am patient at school a lot of the time
when i would watch music videos on <caps> every song that was being played was the edited version
<caps> our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean
we get out of the car and go inside
when i was younger i liked to go fishing a lot
<caps> took our picture and <caps> were off
the greatest obstacle the builders faced was nature itself
the mood created by the author in the memoir is they had no problem finding a house
i will give you guys a <percent> discount
finds out a new website there going to tell there friends and there going to pass it on and <caps> on
its bad for people to be reading those tip of magazines
they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive
i wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans
language like very heart and warm house is what really conveys it
sadly the the road was all muddy which caused me to fall straight onto my butt
he goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but
so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva
another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked on the top of the empire state building is because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas
many people <month> take this as a serious thing
even though it is a really good book and a lot of <caps> read it
this is not what the author wants
my friend found a website with very detailed information for an essay
adding a thousand foot dirigible onto the top of the building would add stress to the frame
by the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again
computers have technical problems that delete files
so i wanted to ride all the rides one more time
in conclusion i think computers are good things
children will not be able to proceed in this section
which would make the mooring masts purpose illegal
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock
at that point there would be no turning back
talk to your relatives from <location> and you can shopping without the waiting in line
they started off in a small apartment then later getting the money to move into a simple house
when it was finally time to board one of my sisters had to use the restroom
every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that i am comfortable with <caps> violent or hateful content
so we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars
this things should be pulled
our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs
so you wont get sleep and if you have school you wont be able to concentrate you will to busy worried about the game
and thats why i love them
the time i had <num> be patient was when i was at my first foot ball game
then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people
you need the computer so you can print picture for your report
it tells us that she will keep trying and is determined to do so
<caps> <caps> friends definitely take second place
computers let us look up valuable info
the mood created by the author in the memoir
it seems to me that people need different activities to get them off the computers
all of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you cant stop reading because you have to find out what happens
she will take the test a second time and pass
and you if go to these place then you would need place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends
knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important
why take that magic away from children
it keeps me up to date with currents
so i got my fishing poles ready packed my <caps> and went to sleep so i could get up early
the spire was actually a mooring mast to be used for docking dirigibles
getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence
then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot
this proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out
the hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society
we all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance
you can feel the warmth of the room with the adjectives he uses
the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area
the dirigibles were so large that the buildings structure was at danger of failing and destroying the building
in my own words patience is when you have to just be com and quiet
with all the ways computers help us there is no reason why they would negatively affect us
it takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to
the computer made for storing information and learning
in his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him
once i went to <caps> world and we were waiting for about <num> hours to get on this stupid rude
you could keep in touch with old friends or family
for instance one time while i was on a long car ride and very bored and about to fall asleep
this story is about how <person> parents created a home
people will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and wont be in pain anymore
you can also do that on a computer
i would be mad if i came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer
a has the highest obesity rates in the world
it could tear up the mooring mast
they can make you uncomfortable
<caps> campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first <time>
this means that weather could make traveling dirigibles very dangerous
i think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad
sometimes kids forget their text books at school
it takes great bravery
i agree that computers are having a positive impact on us
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
in my case laughter was the shortest distance between <person> <caps> i
the third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast
that was a time when my classmates and i were patient
this shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring
it causes there to be a lift between family members
she gave us money to go buy a coffee and then she told us to go back home
it was now three against two
the computer helps by reading it aloud to mom
parents can censor what their kids read if they want
she would adapt just like the winter hibiscus
id rather see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood
each day i wonder if its a dream or a nightmare
these are some of the things authors want to avoid
the lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible
they teach new things
in the excerpt the mood created by the author is love
<caps> describes how they did so much to give their child a better life
banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future
we always find one way to fight over something
said that <caps> are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places math
just like weather people always want to know breaking news
safety was a huge issue
his gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life
it was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends
censorship in libraries are a touchy subject
my letter to you was to show you on my opinion on what i think should be in a library or not
another obstacle faced in this creation was nature
sometimes people will push you out of their way
the abandoned grape juice factory is also a let down for the cyclists mental state
and other people should not get offended by what other like
<time> <time> was perfect for star gazing with out a cloud in sight
the final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone
after that i got something to eat and relaxed
in short <caps> four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room
kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like <num> or <num> grade
experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds
my final reason that computers hurt us more than they help is addiction
this book has been meant to tell of what slaves would be punished by if they were caught
one day i think the <caps>
i would not want anyone to be offended like that
well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier
i think this took a lot of patients from coach <person>
the ride that we were on was space mountain at <organization> land in <location>
we went on a couple more walks for the next month or two and we got a good mother an son relationship
he keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on
they had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there
short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain
it is easier than the hassle <money> crowded malls and long lines
later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy
i think that the mood created by the author was happiness
another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble
because some books and movies are bad to show little kids
thats not all we can do
the mood created by the author of the memoir is thankfulness
with computers we have enough for each kid in the class
the mood created by the author in the memoir is to show gratefulness towards the authors parents
we are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal
she had the memory of her grandmother and hibiscus
the setting was rough
it was a late <date> <time> and he was walking me home like he always did before
but even though it started out good almost nothing last forever
if you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward
the corners of her moth began to curl up and a slight giggle leaked out
dirigibles that were built outside the u
another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the <date> ft
the setting has a major role for a cyclist
i want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay
as the bell rang i hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line
one example is most dirigibles from the outside the united states used hydrogen
taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries
there is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some <month> feel offended
the people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family
i thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend
you can instantly talk to people and catch up with them
then one by one everyone took a shower except for me
after the game we all go and party at <caps> <caps> house to celebrate a big win
i believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong
pretty much having the same personality and both always smiling and laughing helped us connect right away
i am one of those people
at first <person> is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughters actions and feelings
why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud
i still feel temptation trying to rush time and make me anxious and grueling to wait so long but <caps> still patient and try to let the temptation go away
the obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger
i had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride
censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction
when we were pulling up to the window to get the food <person> told his grandma to pull up far enough so he could get the food
the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips
its an escape for them from everyday life
it also depends on how they get along and how they treat each other
we also use handeye coordination is loaded and
at one time i thought i was the most patient person in my whole family
<caps> whole life was being flushed down the toilet
allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful
computer have a positive effect on people because i believe the computer can teach people a lot
after these things come to try and adapt to <caps> ways of life
while he was biking he had to go up crippling hills
i have observed numerous pitchers who just completely give up and look defeated
websites such as <caps> and <caps> are also causes of this
there is no need to over react to words on paper
when i got my head out of the monkey bars i told the kids that they should try putting there head in the monkey bars
so i decide to go try out for a select team
for magazines they should have all types of magazines
they also cant fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days
but its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it
i was patient for my luggage
after all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up
<person> almost caught a huge <num> inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke
in hour pass <caps> the boss came he came he said to <caps> dad <caps> for waiting <caps> finally hes done for his meeting
this shot <person> takes
this was why the setting was affecting the cyclist
but yes take with caution there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at till adults
less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day
computers help us expand our knowledge all the time
the family invites many people over to their home to have dinner
the two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem
i started reading <caps>
music is something you listen to or you hear
wonderful moments that i will never forget
i laughed at her for so long and those are the moments i wish i could bring back
so my mom was so proud of me
to begin with computers helps us expand our knowledge
he was starving and he still was being very patient
that includes children
the author of the memoir created the mood very well
thats one bright side
and hydrogen is highly flammable
this sentence gives a welcome home and loved mood
but the main reason was safety
but sometimes you have to be patient
since the united states has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the united states
for a lot of <caps> a sport is their exercise and in every sport you need handeye coordination
i believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers
there was another day like that
my last frame i got up and picked the ball i wanted to use
we were both happy this had happened
if someone wants to write a book on what they think is right then they are allowed to do that
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on there own rather then you just keep telling them
finally is the tumbleweeds
this year i tried out for the <num> grade volleyball team for my school
she bought herself a flower to cheer herself up
we played with there dog after a while
more than <percent> of most students in an average school have one
that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area
and that was something that they could find in <location>
this made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children
my cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient and we tried
he gave me a cast and crushes and then we left
also you wont enjoy nature for yourself
to set the empire state building apart from the <organization> decided to put a mooring mask for dirigibles
these are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society
<person> was trying to be as patient as possible
<caps> that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and secure
and <person> <num> grade <caps> class when i surveyed them there ans a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer
by censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author right to speak
there should just be a children library and then make another library for the adults
in the story he says the bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water
that is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections
then after awhile of that it was dinner time and my mom told us to get off and come eat
it will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers
they can tell you a lot by just the touch of keypad and the click of a mouse
another obstacle was nature itself
i would have to look harder
those movies are watched by people of all ages
he had seemed upset since he had picked <caps> up which was completely out of the norm for him
i wiped the sweat from my eye the way the author described the hill as crippling should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist
not everyone is going to think alike
for music theres different types also
everyone has their own level of patience
the mood show that the author had a great childhood and loved his neighborhood very much
i think that since he talks about his friends and neighbors so well that it is a happy neighborhood
keep us sheltered is not going to protect us it only makes us want <caps> ever we cant have even more
this <caps> its appreciative because it says that he has thanked them over and over again
this made me very unhealthy i gained nine pounds in one week
however the effects it has on people can be bad
which was something i could tell right away <caps> was the dog for me
a few different moods went on in the story but one of the most important was loving
as i crossed it my wheels started spinning out and flinging mud at me as a result i ended up very dirty
then me and my mom finally got called and that was story of the time when my mom was patient
after we put the dogs in we started to go
that is just insane that you would want to wast that money after <caps> being payed for
without it we cant do anything that patience
sometimes life can feel so cruel
one reason that it was difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building was safety issues
so <caps> drove past <organization> and then <caps> started to cry
the author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life
it was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating
<caps> shows that <caps> loves his families cooking and his own
i know that when i was younger i used to play math and science games on the computer to help me study for tests
he took me into the shop which is connected to the woodshed out of the cold and turned on the furnace to keep me warm
if you do theirs something wrong with you
this quote shows that he is not only thirsty but dehydrated which is several for a human being
i had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go
the setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next <num> miles easily
i believe there should not be any censorship in libraries
computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago
if a child gets addicted to the computer it will affect how he interacts with other and <month> do serious damage to their brain
being around these people is like watching a comedy movie or act
i ran out the auditorium doors
the architectures and engineers of the empire state building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast
i began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do
the second reason why i am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming
this is why i think computers have an positive effect on kids and adults
this can be a good thing because then kids wont have the obvious reason to get the story
i cant believe i fell for that we finished up are meal and went home laughing and joking all the way
i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends
this can also affect the way people lively
after a long day at the <organization> mom said it was my turn to decide where we went to dinner that night
you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
the builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat
at one point i actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school
it was almost her birth and she was so exited for this birthday because she was turning twelve
just your average teenage party
winds and hydrogen were main focuses
she had been asking her <caps> for a while now
so he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing
i was with my mom and my sister <location>
imagine the impact if the <caps> had locked away every copy of the <caps> because it brought about change and controversy
one can also attach documents that <month> consist
laughing is a healthy drug it affects you and other people for the best
the movie was i <caps> <caps>
i talked to him about him asking them if i could do any work for a little cash
being patient is hard sometimes but easy others
some people say that computers make you not be able to see while
the trip to the top went smoothly and no one fell or got hurt
or some thing that fun or i think or beneficial to me
the <time> time i was patient was <time>
i am going to write a story about patience
my dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me
and computers can make our live s a little easier
some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion
i go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down
a lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf
making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough
i asked her why she was saying that about herself because i knew she was a responsible person
the reason i say this is because <caps> is important to spend as much time with family and friends instead of being on the computer <num>
the games teach you different things about history
last reason is you need a computer to put music on your <num> players
unplug yourself from your computer
we laughed at each other until two in the <time>
laughing at them makes them think that its <caps> to do what they are doing because it is making others laugh
this building of the mooring mast simply went from a dream to more of a way to win a record for the worlds tallest building
she wanted to go <caps> we left and talked about it the whole way home
suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library
defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports
so i figured out the hard way
the first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the height they are already at
i know that sadness can sometimes take over but we all need to think positive and not let the negative things take over
<person> and <person> had agreed with <person> mom and yelled at me to
some books say sexual things in them that <month> offend a race of some type or a gender
if this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown new <caps> walk
<person> was speechless as he handed her the bouquet
another obstacle the builders faced was the violent weather at the top of the building
i will always remember that ride through the mountains
if a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out
she had friends from high school and college who she ever talked to
there where some small rapids running right throw the middle of it
<caps> patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences
they would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats
the desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow
i find out it was sold out
she got really upset and stormed out of the place leaving me alone
i hope you think about this
and that we our funny adventure story
aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing the computer holds many more wonders
most of the time these words are said when i am angry at myself or another person
grapes of <caps> was banded because their was slavery in it
it was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the buildings frame
<caps> the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail
you could use <organization> and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashion
the last day we were up there we got up early
not just <caps> person should be able to talk for everyone
so computer help the community
that can lead a person to being very lazy
it needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents
but also i think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it
one last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles
entertainment can not always please everyone
many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate
the setting in do not <caps> posted speed limits affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes
and that i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
you not only read at home but at school as well
the other things you can figure it out on your own
that was the time my mom was patient
computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people
she kept on looking and looking
kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just setting at home
then when i got there it looked like there were <num> people in line at the time
people already spend way to much time watching t
the winds above the building were constantly blowing and shifting direction
the author explained how her parents were very courageous and brave for leaving their home land
so instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking on the daily news or searching like that
we had already got our food and we were waiting to get it so we could eat
one night my little brother came home with a book that he got for the library
most times i will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie
the next few months were going by faster than ever
<caps> was the best sight in the world
when we finally started to calm down <person> came down stairs
there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age
<caps> i went to see how long the line was
its like an addiction
it is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world
countless times i was in desperate need for information
but if you going to go on to just go on to just talk to friend then that is a waste of time in somebody life
<caps> got bored <caps> he went in the kitchen to see was dinner ready
the use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk
in this case patient was a great thing for <person> and i
i was angry at that point
they should just mind their own business
friendship is another great relationship for laughter
sometimes i have to wait an hour or <num> minutes
then he came upon rolling hills and rough <caps>
he was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave
i am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world because computers help everyone in their education
i know i would be fine with <person>
he soon almost ran out of water only made things worst
my dad sets up his house as a haunted house
safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air
some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers
by using computers i have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial
second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house
i think we need to reform this problem soon
you cant protect your children from offensive material
the author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents
another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers
soon after that the cops came
some parents bring their child up they way they want to
i ran out of the bathroom
thanks to websites like <caps> and email people can easily stay in touch
four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the empire state building
book censorship limits knowledge
<caps> <person> replied in a confused voice
the dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers
safety was the greatest obstacle
so then we had to take the game to <caps> <caps> and have them look at it
she had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish
and then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions
i need it for basketball
<caps> looks at me like <caps> was going to punch me
this is loving because it shows he is happy and he enjoys being with friends and family
for an adult it can show them meanings of words or new words
that was a huge obstacles the builders of the empire state building had to face
<num> people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all
thats when her red flowered dress flew up and we could see her tong
considering the freedom of speech one can express
we followed the rules and started doing cartwheels and round offs down the halls instead
the warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue
the computers that we have are missing your life us you no it up
they do not have to read these books it does not affect them
i chose write a story about a time when i was patient
it was a super boring day
i want to go home i managed to sniffle
i was to scared to see how long the other lists were
everyone should pull the plug on their computers for good and never turn them back on
the greatest obstacle was nature itself
finally i saved up enough money
<caps> was almost time for <caps> birthday
some parents are less active with their kids
<caps> talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way
<caps> she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries
the way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful
if you want to be on the computer instead of going outside thats your choice
examples are him talking about how all the cultures got along good with one another in his area
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents paragraph <num> states
the physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position
computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures
in basketball you need to be able to look up and dribble at the same time
there not the kind anyone could go out and but though
would add stress to the buildings frame
this is a positive effect for our country
its clear that the computer is not safe
so i walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little <caps> running around in there
that is the mood and some examples created by the author in the memoir
because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the everchanging winds
the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort
some people my be funnier than others but everyone has a sense of humor within them
i love being with my dad because i always have fun and learn something that will be vary helpful to me
and these teachings have been the basic of my life
i was trying to be patient but the patience was wearing off
<caps> least i never got in trouble
after reading this essay i hope you will agree with my position
my brother and i had to go to the bathroom
patience is very important
experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger
many books are banned that address great problems of society
people should not be shielded from the real aspects of life
i would sit there and do nothing
all three of us were laughing hysterically at my faked passion
this proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat
computers are very helpful for people
computers are the way of the future
this quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dieing of thirst
this is where an adult comes in and supervises the child
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways
we can learn about the climate
the second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place
i think the mood of this story is warm and loving
in the end the idea was unrealistic
the cyclist accepts information from foreign old people which made his first mistake
from my personal experience i always do spring cleaning because i want to begin fresh
but the only thing i could do was be patient
i believe there should be some censorship to some extent
studies say by each upcoming generation the communication skills are decreasing by <percent>
i agree with this because the computer can teach people things
this story is about the time i was patient with my little brother
so there is my opinion on this little matter
also if your parents found out you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded
it was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a closer
some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way
a patient person experience difficulties without complaining
this is why computers have a very good effect on people
i got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours
my mum is someone who is patient
s go to school and with computers the kids get a better chance to learn absent the world and society
you hear jokes that are offensive but that is all that it is a joke and it is not to be taken seriously
<caps> it was the day to go on our vacation and my parents were proud of me for being very patient for a week waiting to go to <location>
it was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area
this is why communication having a positive affect on people is the most important reason
you can still believe what you want and read this book
also his friends could come over too
i think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend
that is why i think computers are helpful
the answer to that would probably be sit down in front <organization> a computer all day
freedom of speech is a law and should be followed
there were times when tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
the first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride
the major thing that effects him is the lack of water
<caps> <caps> reenacts the situation and his wild sound effects encourage our laughter even more
then the student could be in trouble
you can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored
he was looking at me as if he was all tough
your computer is making you stupid
my friends wanted me to stop listening to her music
no one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or <caps>
his attention then altered to his father who was sitting on the edge of the bed cradling a small bundle of pink blankets
to take one book away is to take all of them away
the complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story
that is also a typing game
so i think their benefits our society
how many people do you know
start up your computer and get talking
there are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers
after a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive
so being patient will eventually pay off
movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where the many things i learned there about how to love
a couple months latter we seemed to become really close friends and not just in laughter
this is why i think the authors mood is happy and calm
everyone needs exercise
i walked over to the bucket and <person> came over next to me
the modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses
like jam pack crowded
that day i invited him to come over so we could watch the game together
he learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum
the computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away
offensive books and movies can cause many problems
i flashed <caps> with the flash light <person> started laughing
another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well
by <date> i had spent multiple weekends with <organization>
she is the only one who makes me happy when i feel down
that goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like
she believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read
that is my personal opinion many others <month> have different opinions on this subject but i just think every thing should just stay on the shelves
things today are way different
in taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away peoples right to freedom of speech
i was patient when i had to witch <num> little bad girls at my sisters house
if they get off they can and if they won to sit there and waste or
one time i played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds
we were in the waiting room of my dads doctors office
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
this essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone
later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents
another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects
we also got stuck behind every slow person with <caps> way to get around them
i personally think that reading is better <date> sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing <caps>
perhaps the greatest reason was because <caps> dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice
through him i have met tons of great friends
i honestly believe that is could be the a short distance
i was patient as they explained it
finally after the longest <num> minutes of <caps> life there was no sign of thunder or rain
as construction neared completion many concerns arose
i worked hard all night to get it done
it makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable
so my mom had to give it all back to them
computers can help with countless things
i hope you will trust me that the computer has a positive effect on society
when people fall in love they find someone to share their life with
a <caps> is that everyone wants to share their event with the family
these great qualities computers have for people are fantastic
<person> and i were together basically every day and every night
i talk to my friends everyday on the <caps>
i looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply i expected
we walked around the playground some more <caps> talking about past memories or something that happened to each other in the past
the censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed
please excuse the mess
costing over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the buildings framework
we waited for <num> hours till we got there
it actually turned out pretty good after all
<caps> cant win every time
after five minuets of that my mom told me to sit down and find something to do
<person> told me to keep going she new where we were
i was stunned by her voice
computers informed many people about them
not know how my brother could just sit there and color for twenty minuets
i frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college
i know the benefits of laughter
this iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with <organization>
since there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
he was still waiting for the call <caps> still nothing
but the trip he makes changes his mind a lot
this quote shows that the mood was cheerful and calm
the winds a that height are constantly different and could cause the dirigibles to move around
for as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons
this is the best and most efficient way to protect and keep everyone safe
these multiple factors easily disallowed any possibility of successful airship travel in the future
also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget
the mood created in the memoir was based off how the author felt about his home and family
then it was <num> o clock
the mood created by the author made me feel grateful for what i have in life
this tests and quizzes
the cyclist makes this statement
i can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time but so would a book
the lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water
i once has to drive <num> hours to see my grandma in <location>
laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together
wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building
we do have books here that are kept behind the librarians desk that if you really wanted to read that book its behind her desk
everyone piled back on the bus and called our parents to let them know we were coming home
<caps> computers also allow people to talk to each other via the <caps>
if the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding
when i was a child i picked up on everything
i was content with the fact that i had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk
also the mood of this story is very loving
you of course need a <caps> to do thank one
the movement swelled and the <caps> people soon developed a national pride and goal
so i think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves
social networking is placed at the top of the list
get out there and get a computer
my story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors
these two things are not okay
the builders of the empire state building faced more problems than expected to
i know you might think that computers can make families get further apart but they actually bring them closer together
with all of us being different all over the world
the winds that high were very violent
m because our plane was scheduled to depart at <time>
but at least i learned something
now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and he can say the library has no restrictions
com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert
i agree with computers do produce a positive impact on children
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
to add on to that this is good for are society because if we use paper thats killing more trees
i was a cold <date> day and i was at school
censorship in libraries is good in some ways
once your power goes out you have noting to do because you got fired all because of you computer
also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal
so we were waiting while the life guard was telling the boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid
also it symbolizes rebirth
it starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party
i smiled sarcastically
i should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf
she then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother
when we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff
being able to talk to anyone that is far away is good
these conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination
i had no shortage of traits to choose from
the builders of the empire state building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building
they would also be careful of pedestrians they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street
it was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome
even doctors are computers your medical needs and give time
now can you see how much the computer benefits society
we look into each others eyes after wards and begin to laugh
i think high schools <caps> to put these books into the libraries because it might help some kids grow up and become more mature
computers can your family too
my dad rapidly opened the door to find me crying with laughter
am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way
there are many people who need that because of their knowledges
in that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book you will find a number of people that would read the book
such bravery they had
identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt
more family time can be but i think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising
next i support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people
i believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on
then we went on and on talking
mine has a ruby in it
in conclusion i hope i have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly
<percent> of people only use computer to connect with family
we are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine
he was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant
another reason why i would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save alot of important things
no one knew what was to come or the laughter we would experience
the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would transmit all the way to the buildings foundation
parents should also care about what there child hears or reads if there young
everyone got caught up in the hype in my opinion
in order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself
second would be the animals there dangerous
we were laughing together
the buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points
computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school
another obstacle was safety
for one your eyes will begin to hurt
he never gets into fights with his mother or father
he is <num> and we hang out just about every day
there are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking
he likes that his parents are selfless and that they care about others
the way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable
they also get receive an unconventional or unintended education
it is actually a very simple matter
this day is usually a time to kick back
this would have both meaning and make the empire state building the worlds largest building
the builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed
finally the hundred points there came
computers made that event possible
he might have died from dehydration
so <caps> went and looked around
of course i sulked but looking back on it now i am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better
the three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first
this is a time when someone i know was patient
everyone loves staying on the computer
as i go on and on my mom has the patience to listen to it
s required the use of hydrogen
it <month> be starting an argument that is funny to us
the child obtains a book that is about violence and sex
we laughed for probably a half an hour <caps> one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened
computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than <caps>
is is not the same as the actual thing
as i walked back to the locker room i glanced around the massive gym
there were also no people around to help him or give him water
<caps> finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone
i had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up
i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it
the hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants
we were laughing and scared at the same time
my second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday
one more obstacle they faced was an existing law
the cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay
i turned and stepped out onto the empty stage and took my seat in the front of the band
people will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to
<caps> but i want to practice some more
but when got there we got there it so worth the wait
they wanted their son to have a good life
<num> and how many people go on at least an hour a <num>
there are many reasons this paragraph is included
those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist
not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see
this goes from kids to adults
last she burst into tears again
we should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too
other opinions wont matter
he had to deal with a diamond back
they choose to modify the frame and strengthen it as well
this one she can actually call home
more than <percent> of <caps> give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them
taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading
the constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character
stuff like that i can understand because that can be personal reasons
i know that a lot more kids too because i was reading in a magazine that <percent> of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer
the new trend in schools all around the globe is the addition of computers or a computer lab
if the net was shorter i would be able to get my volleyball serve over
also fears of the sharp edges and forceful winds would cause the dirigible to get punctured and pop
people read for enjoyment and knowledge
this is a problem because <caps> this no exercising thing does stop the life span could be greatly shorten
it is a part of history
that is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf
if its for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life
this required a lot of extra work for the builders
in the end the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the problems that came with it
i believe that with out laughter my family would not be as close as we are
he was only one year old
some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went threw
m y hand strikes the ball
take my story for example
for many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman
without those things in our life i really can see this world falling apart
what we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so
i would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right
i strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons
you should have all the materials that a child should be interested in
one is on a rainy day
in the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water
ever since the <organization> was invented obesity and lack <organization> exercise in a persons schedule has skyrocketed
it only took him <num> minutes and he was already in <location>
i have had an experience in which i was offended by a movie i watched
here we are at the fair
<caps> still hurts to fight with friends
the computer can make you gain quit a bit of weight
it helps complete a number of tasks
in the spring the geese will return and the hibiscus will be budding
all the time i was waiting i was getting more and more hungry
public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people
it <caps> helps you at your hand movements
be patient with everyone because patience is respect
these threatening winds would have made it impossible for the dirigibles to land and serve as safe transportation
i think the people with the best personality are the people who can make someone else laugh
movies can bring things to life
just because children think its cool
<caps> started laughing so <caps> that she started laughing
a time when i was patient was when went to the mall
children in there <organization> years through about first year of <organization> should <caps> have to see that
these are little things we can do to make a change for good
<num> you have a friend or family member you lost contact with
the answer is computers
to me laughter is what makes people so unique
i like talking to people from all over the country
this helped me get over my fathers absence
another major worry was safety
all of a sudden a kid started breathing heavy
everyone started to talk and walk around
law stated that the dirigibles would be flying to low for urban areas
when he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die
this way more and more families can do activities together
if anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in
i could get a slight view of the donkey
computers have a very positive effect on people
same with any other high school student
then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down
it was really something to think back to all we have done together on the bus
if they are overweight their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge
there has always been a sense of subliminal messaging throughout the development and evolution in the cinematic world of movies
having a more positive day and going out and saying i read <organization> wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear
you can go on the computer and chat with friends but not all the time
win i went <caps> <caps> <caps>
when he finally put me in
joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms to there family
as stated in the reading
libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have a warning signs for their age
to sum it all up i say take them off the shelfs
most of my friends do it with me
and it continues i will never forget this house or gracious neighborhood
so i let them cut and i have to wait and be patient
however the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is far different
this was an obstacle because it would add stress to the buildings frame when it was attached by single tether
this is because those books contain material that is not at all conducive to the young persons brain
one main effect that see is many people play the computer too long and are becoming overweight
computers are too important and beneficial to lose
to conclude i think computers are not good for us
if students go to school and they are in high school they pretty much already know what is going on around the world
animals are the one thing that cant talk back or make fun of you
that one stupid word stood in my way no
we would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future
during that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together
that night we went fishing on the <caps> river and we still caught nothing
this is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age
first the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like
it would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians
probably not will that computer game running
therefore i think if you like doing that then the computer is what you need
we can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material
the geese coming back in the spring will now also remind her of her new name and how must try to live there happily now
we had nothing to do
i lost <num> pounds by just swimming for a month
then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information
for example <organization> a couple is just out having a excellent time they would want to keep sharing the wonderful beyond with each other
theres so many more reasons but this is just one mans opinion who knows what other people think about them
there are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children
this in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader
she was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well
today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials
another obstacle for the builders was that the buildings steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design
use a real dictionary
the author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir
it was hard arrived at the first town for author
so at the end of the story she said i will take that test again
if an accident were to happen with a dirigible it would be putting hundreds of peoples lives at risk
another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are <caps>
<caps> was to be paid twenty dollars if i could handle <person> and <person>
its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them
this could potentially cause danger if the back was to hit a building near by or start swinging out of control and break loose from the building
i just laughed so hard that i could feel my abs working out and tears from my eyes coming out
sliding around in snow was the last thing this car ever did
the last reason is that one
we all get offended but just move on from it and find something different
without having to lock down at the keyboard
it is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter
not every one has the guts to say something to the school
movies and books can easily be censored
i think that it is should be left alone the way it is because it put that way for a reason
especially with me and <person>
they can also rent hotels movies and games
the one thing no one said was that one time during the <date>
i wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out
patience is about waiting for some thing
i said we should ride front row
at this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated
when you are always on the computer it erodes you eyesight over time
the only things i can really do is take nasty medicine
and last i think it gives the mood of admiration
later while i was outside i got a visit from old friends of mine
both of these things you can do without a computer
some of the lyrics can really offend people
<caps> one person <month> deem inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person
last this not a time where e wait to patience to other
one part was driving there
thats how a computers have on effect on school
<caps> communicating on these are also another benefit
computers have a large effect on people
if books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already
so when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry
i know that the population of <organization> uses the computer
i could go on for hours listing at the different types
everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials
the blue keeps you up at the top for <num> and drops you while the red one shoots you up to <num> feet
one day we will end up like the world in <caps> <num>
so there are children books and there adult books
i ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed
thats the part i was wrong about
it also discourages him
the rest <organization> her family still lives in <location>
i think that computers have a good effect on people
they often shift because of violent air current
a real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired
the people of the household woke up irritable and grumpy
what a happy ending for a patient filled paper
it was <date> and i was on my way too pick up a long time no see friend too go to a warped tour concert
some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to
by the way the author writes about his family <caps> can just feel the warmth and love that his family provided for him
i rely on my computer so much that i would be lost without it and i would get half as much done
third reason every could be offense to somebody
in the spring the hibiscus will be budding again
keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way
they mostly were memories of good past times and how he grew up in a loving and caring family
always and i mean always be patient
computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without having to go there
the one only a jerk could have
he told me give him till the end of the week
well in the library they will have generations of books on offensive material
once we were settled in we went in to <location>
one obstacle was nature
we were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up
the first reason was computers have a bad effect on people is it can really hurt your eyes
after that dinner i went strait up to bed
due to seeing this they <month> get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life
they played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos
when kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search <caps> and <caps> saves time
think about the a day doing fat because of all the fast food on the computer while eating it
but my sister was always calm and patient
it was during <caps> class that we visited the library to look at various books
now that just shows that laughter is the shortest distance between two people
those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad
the author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph
when it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat <person> and i were on one side and his parents on the other
there will be some interesting things you will find like different kinds of bugs and of insects
i thought it was going to be a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared
they made reservations at the <organization> in <location> and then take a walk on the beach afterwards
it would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street
its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf
we all started cracking up laughing
i love swimming better than going on the computer
the winds are much stronger than down the streets
viruses can come in many strengths some can crash your computer some just send boat loads of popups to your monitor
<caps> there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk
i was amazed she was sad but took her time carefully and slowly as if every move she made had to be perfect
they now had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building
one day it was sunny with a cool breeze
when people go on the computers they forget all about things they do
it <month> also make the person feel violated and offended
but now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned
a plant called the winter hibiscus
i think that computers are good because of these reason
the temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water
she said with a smile
the cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination
the library is all about learning
now onto my third and final reason
this one starts in my <date>
the main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of <organization> below
on these open chat rooms you can talk to people that are thousands of miles away
i use the computers to better understand it
i began to wonder if we would ever resolve this
books do not kill people
that is why i think the mood is love
they also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects
you can also see majority of people like what they got
laughing with people has been the greatest influence in my relationships with my friends
then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about <num> almost maybe even hotter
the author set a great mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir
you can see you favorite shows and moves
therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech
it smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon
these problems caused this idea to disappear
by this time i was doubled over struggling to speak through all the <caps> i was consumed by
my alarm went on at <time>
i played <organization> and the game
this would then be transmitted to the buildings foundation as well
the book will make the kids think thats the right thing to do if they are able to check it out
the mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy
censorship in libraries should not be allowed
sometimes you are just so happy that it all builds up inside and has to be let out
priority not too long ago
reduced social interacting and skills also result
but i did not complain one bit
so that is my story about patients in my own way
computers can help kids with homework
i would have to face <organization> on my own
they are not a waste of our time
<person> started to explain to me that he was half brother to my sister <caps> who was one of the siblings that i had been searching for
also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him
they might not even test it anyways
there have been times where i had to be patient
if they can be at home on the computer for hours then they probably can hang out in real life
and computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family
he loved swords so much
and this story is true
i have been waiting ever since
i feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing
<caps> like you caught dinner for tonight
the author chose this to end the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart
we forgot about my mom and brothers so we left
my imaginary friend is a <caps> user in my imagination
my mom went shopping for dog store they told us we could pick him up on <date>
magazines help people keep up with news
there come a point when things just become too much
but not at all of us can afford to travel far away
every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around
they love to pain of others
laughter is our brains only way of coping with the world
last but not least <caps> it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools
that is why i believe books should not be censored
it seemed as though he never left
it dropped but it was still alive laying down
in the story there are many reasons to suspect shy she ended the story with that paragraph
this last paragraph is written for several reasons
he is annoying every day but i listen to him anyway
other peoples parents <month> feel the same way
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful
<caps> declared as <caps> tried to defended herself
<caps> kissed the top of my head
there is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library
thats actually how i met him
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
it going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it
i was proud of way self for not complaining
it was at her home where she learned the real definition of family
in a recent poll <num> out of <num> people say that computers had made them more social
seeing the geese and winter hibiscus
also he learn how to love people
those are the reasons why i think the computer has a negative effect on people
movies and television
i know thought they were buying a pair of boots
it then goes on to say most dirigibles from out of the u
it takes away our freedom of the press and speech
i was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter
his spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water
all because of a movie or book
laughing is one of the things we do best
she got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing
to avoid getting into trouble his dad told him to go across the street because there was three boys down the block that looked like trouble
i wanted to know what i had missed out on
censorship is a touchy subject in our society today
one of the things that i had to do was to talk to the group of other participants and two <caps> for about one hour
a lot of people use computers today
i was me a while then i did it
lead weights could not be used
my <caps> and i waited in the line for about an hour
patience is something not very many people have
the mooring mast was a failure from the start
was to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster
outdoor <caps> in sixth grade i went to outdoor <caps> i got up really early and went to <caps> where the bus is taking students to outdoor <caps>
i wanted her to look back at me
also you can chat with <caps> or old friends
the first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds
the setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike
another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of <location> libraries
i think it would be a crime against <location> to censor things in libraries
the way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight
computers help us communicate in many ways
it is happy because the overall memoir is about family and friends and good his child hood was
the author was just so proud of his life and parents
he also hates the smell of dentist office
this taught me one thing
we now have an inside joke and every time i remember that day i tell him from flat to volume and we both just start laughing
mooring dirigibles would not be good at all if they were being moored on top of the empire state building
not all of the world will care to see <caps>
he soon started to be out of breath more always have a high blood pressure and he started to become overweight
my last reason why i say that you should spend more time off of the computer is so that you could spend more time with your family
we where mad and my dad was losing his patients too
the finally started to unravel
you can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home
we have <caps> pretty funny time in there
and the highest observation deck has never been open to the public
i listened to my mind
this is why i believe the author ended the story this way
in the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water
children exposed to at least <num> hours a day to <organization> compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are <num> times as likely to develop such possibilities
thank gosh it was during the <date> because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad
i just wanted to get out of the car and walk home
its a good way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy
the memoirs mood is the love of the authors parents to him
not spending much time can have a big effect on mother nature
thats how i feel about censorship in a library
<caps> was thinking what can he do until dinner is ready <caps> he went to go to play his video game
which is good because its much easier
he said i will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home
she referred to the plant as yet another old friend
having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself
this would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is
if people want this is going to be a big war
everything is offensive to someone
if people want to spend countless hours sitting in front of the glowing technology then be it
my parents passed on to me
i was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them
as an architect said it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the empire state buildings flat roof
i hope you agree with me
doing such the phone would be very expensive
reason one you loose interaction with people
it seems as if inappropriate materials are found everywhere in todays world
before i could even blink i saw her sprinting out of the <caps> and screaming off the top of her lungs
builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
it was my <num> birthday
well the two that hide were <person> <person> <person> <person> the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend <person> <person> i
starting at thirteen and up through adulthood
as i was running i noticed this slippery spot
so he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men
in the story rough road ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about
i stood there smiling for quite some time
libraries should not have the right to censor material
<caps> said no teacher asked why the kid said because i have been going to a basketball tournament
computers cost a lot of money
its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of some one
the setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water
i know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading
from the excerpt the mooring mast there where many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
<person> gets up goes outside brings more wood for the fire place and starts lighting it
it is when you as a individual can act like a human being
after all those obstacles they could finally build the mooring mast
it made our trip worth going
i looked up at <caps> helper and saw a girl
the idea of censoring items from children based on offense is not something that should be pursued
there was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him
it was the practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights but over a civilian area this was neither practical nor safe
i had plans to go to a basketball game after school
i believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive
the kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away
please read on to understand my reasons
i would like for you to appreciate my concern on how <caps> society should have computers
in every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste
the rest of the concert was pretty funny
in this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity
my father and his father has all of their records in a safe
it depended on the wind and climate
we were excited because our teacher <person> was going to show us a movie
even though i probably should have been mad
this shows that he is grateful for what he received and the mood is very joyful
lets say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country
even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mast the back of the ships would swivel around
it can be an enjoyment to read to the next person
i will sometimes though look back on how i reacted and that by itself will make me laugh
this is why laughter is so important to the the three of us
the author is showing that he knows how immigrants come to <location>
there was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age
after we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened
she is very thankful for he family and important friends
either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize
this paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends
builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempt to moor a dirigible
the weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation
this ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent
he showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong
someone can not be frustrated with a novel written <num> years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards
she will take the test again and will not give up
your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers
censorship has become a major part of the media nowadays
so she is going to be reading to prepare for when the spring comes when the hibiscus is budding then she will be budding too by passing her test
they get hand eye coordination
<person> rolled her eyes to me
my entire team stared at me
one last obstacle the builders faced was the wind
as i explained to her <caps> is happening
it is something that some people might do
you also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me its really not about what i get its the things i do to help out my peers
they get on an they stay on forever
the features of the setting effect the cyclist
same goes for books and etc
but there are many other types besides rap
for <person> this was a small step up from an ordinary date but for <person> this was the biggest day of his life
one of them being the mooring mast its self
i have to bring a car bag to entertain me
they let people live at there house
we were walking down <caps> street when a bolt of lighting struck through the trees
nature would bring up many challenges for the builders to have to work around
i had to get my shots
then i open my presents
i remember when i was younger i would love to learn about the <caps>
we arrived at the hatchery and we began by feeding some fish they have out in a pond
if you be patient you could do things much better
also in paragraph <num> my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family knowing that they would do the same for us
now i know what your thinking what of we need to print something
the speed limit was 55 mph
one person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book
when your supposed to be vacationing in <location>
their are better things to <caps>
this gave him a better life
the feeling of boredom quickly flew over our heads
handeye coordination is a very important skill to have
it was the cool thing for the <organization> studs
i actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book
<caps> is thankful and grateful for everything his parents and family have done
the word has greatly changed
we are always laughing almost every moment we are together someones is always making a joke
there are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer
if they lose their jobs they can pay for they cant use their computer
i do not think they should just be removed and out of the way
this censorship will only cause future issues
in conclusion it has to be obvious that i feel censorship should be used in libraries
every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto where it counts we all bust out laughing
also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start
now the kids know how to say them
that is basically an every day thing for me and my sister
there should not be a certain kinds of books in the library
the long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride
i cant talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up
many people want computer because they do have enough money to <caps> one
he opened the door just a crack and peered into the room
when i got bit by a dog i was in <location> when it happened
well i have been there
the library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied
the second issue the builders had to face was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
<organization> was the hardest match test i ever done
that line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage
the mooring mast was needed because the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the <organization> flat roof
the black and white <caps> <caps> sticker
<person> explained as the started too lead toward the intersection which was about fifty yards away
the books someone decides to read is up to that particular reader
laughter is the shortest distance between two people a thing we have done since birth is laugh
the books that are on and off the shelf
also if you are talking to someone that has a name of someone you know
if it is over pedestrians it is not safe
they also have educational websites that help you with your work
the greatest obstacle for the builders was a matter of safety
i say the same thing to them what i say to everybody who asked me about being patient
owning a computer is surely not a good idea
since that night <person> and i got a lot closer in our friendship
the builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed
this made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless
they will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on <caps> or something
his house welcomed everyone and the air was always filled with not just scent and music but life and love
the geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in <location> which she misses very much
so i went for a walk with him
reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life
another obstacle that the architects faced was nature
which can cause people to loose time and friends
he could do it again
you know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer
this freedom should apply to books
we should take time to read some of those so called offensive books
and the guy at the counter said about two hours
the mood the author gave in the <caps>
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
but there is a good side as well
books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library
the features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip
some people use their computers for business of work related
in our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency
this quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding
the back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds
sports teams because of computers
so the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods
you could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do
why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries
my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family
something this big and having such a long history cant be good for some people
that <caps> someone else happiness is the true gift of life
the balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city
this shows joy because they are all together
this shows thankfulness because shes saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her
the stud tilted to the side
another reason is his parents did hard labor and worked really hard to make he a good life
architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents
these books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material
my sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother
the censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next
and the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all
but we had to wait for a table for a halfhour before we sat down
hes grateful for his parents and how they sacrifice moving to <location>
also i do not care about any noises that go on in the library
then there are people who cant afford it
these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars
everything that was on <caps> was not as bad in my opinion
everybody is not going to like everything but thats just life
that would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building
during <caps> class <caps> was doing a chapter sketch
the air hugged my skin as i walked up the path that led to my friends front door
the planting of the winter hibiscus represented her change as well
there are so many effects in the process of laughing
you lose relationships with your friends and family because you never get off the computer
that is messing up the relationship with your family
going on the computer is much easier
i think this because when <caps> was talking throughout the story <caps> talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are
if you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book
the cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him
if you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want
imagination can scare people
<person> will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
<percent> of people who have to much going life believe that they
she never laughed and she never smiled
if you take those away its like your trying to hold people back from education and knowledge that they have in books
instead of going that direction we went into a picknick table and pushed that right into another one and landed right onto a third table
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
you could do something quite like draw a nice picture
it was slow because we could hardly get through one set of instructions without some group speaking or finding some other way to disturb the class
first we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got
a time i was patient was when me and my mom and dad and my big brother were going <caps> <caps>
i believe this because in the text he says i was going to die and the birds would pick me dead
<caps> the time they got their food it took <num> hour
so i tried laughing and it worked
she was <num> and <caps> was <num> the first time they met
making sure children cannot reach these materials is a concern
people can <caps> learn various facts right from their computers
patience is when your waiting
patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork
i guess patience really is the key
the librarian probably have other things to do like arranging the books or checking out the books or making library card or helping someone find a book
we all understand the benefits of laughter
you can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to
i love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though its just a movie screen
in my opinion i think computers do
music i will said yes and no because some time music is not good but some time people need music to do they work
censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights
everyone have seen a lot of things that are offensive to races and beliefs
sometimes its just the simple things
the mood created by the author is very happy and grateful throughout the memoir
the plant signifies her memories
so take them off the shelves
books are known to do this to people
in seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour
i look at it and it looks like rubber
parker goes on leaving websites
we started preparing for the worst
another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal
a movie that could be considered offensive just by the title <caps> <caps> <caps> cant <caps>
laughter really connects the bond between friends and its helps both of you get through hard times
there are too many magazines that try and expose women
the topic of <caps> and the <organization> <month> be found to be offensive because of what they stand for
or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to
there are also no places to stop for water
say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games
the computer can help reach people from a very young age good handeye coordination
<caps> time went on <person> started to get better and better
another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible
we attend the <organization>
she was angry but she was patient
now i told you all the reasons why i think using a computer is good
in said novel society has outlawed all books
we all hugged her and ran off to the swings and monkey bars
to water down the language or to make the novel kid friendly would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters
children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings
i think that we should have computers
as soon as my friends saw my blue lips the all started laughing so hard that some of them fell in to the freezing water themselves
she thinks she can pass it next time
having to talk on the phone that you can barely hear their threw it just kills me
just one computer can enlighten you with so much
then we got to leave
its a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own
if they get on that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offensive by that
that was neither practical nor safe for the pedestrians on the street
to hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights
laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people
if they have one copy of a book it will begin fights
my friend name is <caps> <caps>
and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing
he is also thinking to himself that he will die out of here
she gives examples in the story that makes many people get many
libraries are almost in every town
i went and got them water
let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries
millions of people read and listen to those materials every day
it seemed like every week one of my friends would get their permit and just pass me up
to do it with family is a great way to remember fun times
one life skill you can learn is how to type
the author is once again stating how thankful he is that his parents came to <location>
every once in a while wed have to move again because of the current
once he made the whole inside safe i was let in
the author makes a very loving and caring mood by doing this
find something to do other than play games on the computer
so one day he took me out for lunch at <organization> because he knew it was my favorite place and i loved going their
censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested
this is unlawful censorship
i remember when my brother was <caps> impatient
laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other
after we changed out of our costumes and back into our regular clothes we started taking pictures
others can get mad at a movie because <caps> discriminates races of other kinds
so i hope you take my ideas an consider them an thank you for listening to what i think
or you can find out facts
the change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist
<person> has a preference for religious books that explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of his religion
this shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle
though its funny to see that race use those foul words among themselves but when its in a book its racism
and <caps> he loves his family and friends
i glanced over at <caps> and then back at <location>
i got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing
we strapped in our boots <person> went to the lift to catch a chair up
we decided to stay for one more hour and then we left to go home
it is the most meaningful thing that anyone could possible do
people need to get out there and do something other than be in front of the computer screen
no one is going to have the same interest all the time
than it keeps that mood going when he tells us about all the people that come over regularly for dinner
<caps> you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person
i was bored there was nothing good on
he writes that in a way which could make the reader feel that he is extremely happy
i got crushed and none of it would have happened if i had waited
i understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries but their are some cons
this supports the mood of the memoir because the authors appreciative of the atmosphere of the place that he grew up in
it goes from flat road to rolling hills
the features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
at least i still got too talk too him
the mood is created by his parents and where he lives
you then go back to your house and eat the food while on your computer
people can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground
i gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as i handed the items to my mom
one main problem was that the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
people could also use less fossil
he was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water
we are not like a video game that has seconds lives
i felt depressed for the longest time
maybe a friend can help with homework
gym clothes <caps> people say laughter can bring together anyone
docking at the empire state building was too complicated for the idea to be completed
there are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people
so we went to go see if hes okay and he said yea so we took off
i felt so bad for my cousin he had to watch his mother die all because she used a computer everyday cause that has her job
my second reason why people should use stay to computers us <caps>
the information provided on the computer can really teach everyone something
in my opinion having computer is good to have
surprise just kept coming and coming
laughter is an important part of life
first when on the computer people have less time to exercise
for libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights <location> has stood for
this is a huge problem in the united states computers are main cause to why the <caps>
movies are rated by the language and content they have in it
some thing you can <caps> to get them to go out side with you is take the computer away for a week and have fun with your child
he said he learned the real meaning of family in his house and he says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
my first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school
being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing
the heat had affected him greatly as well
if i were the cyclist gazing at the sign i would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead
the author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope
are you okay mommy said <person> walking into mothers bedroom
more and more people are making less effort to see people in person
this site was trebling
also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more
she uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn
probably not to happy
many say that history repeats itself
making friends with laughter
make certain items restricted and red flagged
<person> let me go first
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot
four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play
while using a computer you can <caps> many things
i know what is out there and some of the books or movies are not always kid rated
the mood of the memoir is generally happy
i think that computers have a positive effect on people
so we had to wait a really long time
this little boy comes running down the hall in a panic who cant find his brother
computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one
many people also speed up their word by using the computer
i was so proud of myself
especially with fast food playing a role
furthermore hes in the middle of nowhere
thats why having trust is a big deal in a friendship or any kind of relationship
that is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library
most of that time can be used to exercise
this might just be the greatest thing about the computer
its not even on purpose half of the time
like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him
when you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything
everyone is different
developing a connection to nature can really nurture the use of that is and ill
nature played its role because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents
that he almost died most of missed read it
our relationship has been great ever since then
it also has a very loving tone to it
computers have become the number one source to find information
and trust me i bet you he is think the exact same things you are
you can fine out many hallway can take you to <location> or <caps> beach or other places
the mood the author created was a peaceful mood
a friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry
when weather rolls in giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like its dappled with giant pieces of cotton
these are the main reasons why computers are not beneficial to the society
if the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit
my skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was <num> or <num>
that material is the life blood of our society
<person> and i looked at mom and said wow moms like i know
it was a sunny day outside and it was <date> after school and i had no homework
when we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it
if that happened there would be a very limited supply of books
the books might be offensive to you but to someone else it could just be another book that they want to read
there is a lot to be learned from only a few words
it shows that you get along and that your having a good time
we arrive midmorning
this shows that she is adjusting
here the author shows that hes extremely grateful for what his parents did to help him make a new life
supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect
the best relationship i have is with my best friend <person> and it is filled with laughter
they would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the <location> and maybe even across the globe
also help with learning about far away places
all in all it was a very good time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul
they were both supposed be killed and thrown in the ditch
books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge
thats less trouble you will have to go through later on in life
the only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him
but after an hour and a half i finished the book
when i was about <num> i wanted one thing in the wold
it would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials because one person had got offended
i think that everybody has laughter in there life day in and day out to keep a good attitude wit people
<caps> said <caps> we started laughing
most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends
at the <caps> office
especially when you get older and have children
the front page on <caps>
dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights
he even came across a snake
one evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders
thanks for reading the time i was patience and times when i want to be patience
it is like they are part of our daily vocabulary now
if you meet any person weather it is a grown up to a friend to a person you want to go out with they will always enjoy laughter
computer let people see pictures and videos
you will say that you are board very fast
the line was very long
nature was another factor
this is the time when i was patient
<caps> my mum got up i asked if i could open my presents she said wait till your father gets up
problems quickly arose the first problem that had arose was the lack of a suitable landing area
this story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up
that is because they would start looking at it more
a bunch of blue and green scribbles
they change the medical field too
no one likes to be told what they can and can not do
with some help my fish turned out to be a king <organization> that came in at <num>
he never tries to be someone hes not
i shook my head <caps>
should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive
the name looked and sounded familiar because i used to go to school with a boy with the same last name
one was that they had find away that would not make the building to unstable a thousandfoot dirigible moored at the top of the building
this is one of the many perks of owning a computer
he loved white water rafting and loved the sport of <caps>
after the <caps> cousins wedding <caps> dad said <caps> go fishing
another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment
books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away
also instead of my mom getting mom she was also patient
first of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems trying to make dirigibles able to dock there
he is a very funny and loving man
some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head
it has made me a much happier person
the builders of the empire state building faced many challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top
spending time on the computer runs up the electric bill
<caps> good sign of patience <caps> when you are waiting for your big sister to get out of the bathroom and you just wait until she gets out
if they have access to it then they are going to take it and borrow it
now we have the computer
life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of
woman and <caps> are the same no matter what people say
then my dad went and asked other doctors how long is it going to take
it took me an hour at least to find <person> in that small room
also books are usually funnier to read
also said in paragraph <num> there would be lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street
because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it
everybody would get a cot and would have to endure the warm daylight and the harsh cold bitter <time>
all of these make the cyclist start to give up hope
with the law in the way no one would even want to try
but if you take visit there you will get to really last the food
the book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home
so by you not burning off that fat you just keep gaining and gaining
so when i got home i went on my laptop and looked it up so i did and it said nothing about
there was a time when i was patient for a whole month
people use offensive things all the time but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way
whenever i am morose he always manages to find away to bring a smile to my face and i found that i to had the same ability
because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior
waiting for <num> years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble
since had or ion i jumped out of my dad and woke my dad up and went to the mom
as <caps> grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him
one way is to be respectful to people and people <month> be respectful back
well that needs to change
mainly it falls on parents on what content you want your kids looking at
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
the horizon was what kept cyclist going
sometimes making people laugh when they are sad or mad could also bring you very close with someone
i go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too
i think people should have more ideas
the cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars
<caps> this memoir creates a mood in the reader
laughing at <caps> bell
my creative gears are forever turning
going outside is better for you to
the law stated no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas
no matter how crude a topic <month> be it <month> still be needed by certain individuals
at the end when the setting is bright so is his mood
also to play games on
the creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the empire state building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique
movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for
i had applied in <date> and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to <caps> <person> from <organization>
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles
the children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are
<caps> friend was dumbfounded
thank you for your time
these reasons are why i think a computer is a positive technology
the boat was delayed so we were told it would be late
in the story winter hibiscus by <caps> ho
my mom setting up the table
it <month> be offensive to you but to another person it <month> not be
<caps> expresses his gratitude toward them a lot
to censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens
computers can help people become interested in these different topics and <month> be even inspire some people to go to these faraway places or hack different people
<caps> had passed <person> class
that also shows how grateful the author is
you to watch popular with today
my opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people but you cant say that i am just a kid and she plays on it all the time
another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of wind
<person> the <caps> <caps> <caps> out with buddies are some of the best <caps> of my life if its an adventure or just a <caps> time <caps> out
we did not know what to talk about since we all were so different
i always love to make my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile
computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process
this is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood
these are the reasons i think computers can be bad
i am sure most of the things you have to type for <location> are written using a computer
his is the time i was patient
no good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries
so i took my shotgun and shot her in the chest
in the gym other kids were playing a small basketball game
this is really bad because you were on the computer
it put out a sense of family in the story
the cops investigated everything and called in something
also they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
but it was worth the three hour wait
it was a very long time before the laughter died down
this trip seemed like it was going to be a long one with out my phone
a tree was moving toward me
i turned around to see <person> giggling
when he found out what was wrong
i learned when your patient and not asking you will get what you want
we had grown used to the couple
other than that its none of your concern
there are many examples of this literary technique throughout history
dirigibles from outside the <location> use hydrogen
this is a happy thought and time when different cultures can come together to have friendship
it also helps you by telling you which places are famous to visit
my parents remember they thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere
this is why it support the computer
so computers can not only be unhealthy but they can be deadly
its the parents chose to say its okay if they child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies
do you think way too many people are on the computer
thats how the setting affects the cyclists
he was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road
she is the healthiest person i know and rarely spends anytime on the computer
define these three or four words
an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
so ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers
students would sit in hallways eating their lunch or crowd around one big table chattering loudly to one another
not only will there be no more books but there also wont be anymore libraries for people to go to
so as you can see computers have good effect on our society
boys were <caps> wrong
send it off to your friend
in the memoir the author creates a mood that is calm and comfortable
the author concludes the story of paragraph with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl
my mother and i worked out a compromise that i could read <person> novels that she approved of
those were <caps> a few obstacles they had trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
also it would be over <money> worth of modifications
then my ipod come out
she asked if they could get gas
and that was a time when i was patient for something
she lived with her uncle named <organization>
many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the empire state building
both of both of our families would go and <caps> things together
well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer
i do not think we should deny anyone that freedom
we drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper
the computer is a great source of entertainment
people spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people
<caps> started to get dressed up
not only will you be unhealthy but antisocialism is probable too
that is the second reason why i think computers are good for people
in fact computers help us out a lot
<caps> are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body
<caps> <caps> <person> is here time to go
music artist might also be affected
you can spread your imagination with the games you can play
think of your family and how much you love them
this aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road
one time i was on my way to camp with some of my friends and i looked out the window and saw a sign
once i had to go to the hospital to get an echo on my heart
is cool because the computer help you in everything
my nephew loves school now
and he wont forget it either
computers are also good for you
my grandma said <caps> keep waiting it will come soon
you can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from
like when you go to see a rated <caps> movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie
the features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways
i think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries
these machines have helped scientists to do experiments
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
third of <caps> cant afford one
here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing
another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them
that is just one example of the many i know of
if one read now between the lives it says more than just this
you can learn about or
there is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book
such as in to <caps> a <caps>
architects cannot just drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings roof
thats why parents need to interact a lot
thats when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day
then <caps> started getting late and i had to get home
these are the obstacles the empire stat building faced
we are the <caps> and parents
then the phone rings
the author created several different moods in this memoir
lastly the danger of the weights being over a whole bunch of peoples heads is pretty serious
emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers
the puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks
that way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive
pure bliss and pure innocent
so it cant be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway
after that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens
it would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself
if that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy
they take out the books that have bad words or pictures in them
she was very nice and thoughtful
now she wants to wait to see that flower grown so when she takes the drivers test again
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime
the builders framed the mooring mast with a skeleton of steel
i can just go on the computer and search whatever i want
i was supposed to go tell him how i felt about him always drinking alcohol
this made the builders have to modify the frame
theses materials are what keep people connected with each other
at the end of class <caps> gets graded and the grade on <caps> turns out to be a <caps>
if they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone
what i do think is that they should keep everything in the library
overall there are many ways to describe the mood of the <caps> from reading it
people that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out
total censorship is bad
i start laughing uncontrollably then <caps> without pause
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building had to face
you could send an email and save the paper
would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them
which has helped are society in <caps> ways
the <caps> of <caps> was created to insure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control
one could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses
thats what i thought
i believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in the world today
the books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad
i thanked her all the end of the day for being so patient with me
there are many stories i could tell you about laughing with my cousin
also you see the words that you are typing and you press with you hands
one reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information
we used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week
and you know how people say computers are bad
i remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff
libraries carry many different kinds of books
we had to wait for a hour before he came back out of the market
he could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion
when you email some one and then the email you back it saves the and government money
i peered over the edge and saw a little path
the problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians
should be aloud to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries
some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family
one obstacles was that the building with a mooring mast on the top of it attached by one cable to a dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame
so if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from
computers can even score tests
as he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty
too much time in front of the computer will also take <caps> toll on your eyes
if they are offended they can go to read some where else
this was thought out to be a great idea
realized how much worse the accident would have been
how there parents always had their arms and door open to many people knowing they would do the same for them
this is the main reason that people become socially depressed
another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature
it <month> effect their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things
<caps> also says that his family was a lot of people in his neighborhood as well
some material <month> have offensive comments that is sexual
the sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice
it makes it easier to work on projects
growing up my mom always told me that laughter is the best medicine
another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains
the world has seen what can happen when things get censored
i felt like we had been their for weeks days even <caps> their were a lot of kids crying and playing
i think computers have a very positive effect on people
this author creates many moods in this memoir
the problem was solved after spending over <money> on a steal frame to support the mast
<caps> stayed that way all afternoon
nobody would tell me whats going on
i know how the summer heat can affect you during <date> activity s
they should stop the computer games
they <month> even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school
some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself
in the desert his water tasted like the flavor of battery acid
<caps> told us all kinds of crazy stories about when he was a boy
safety and nature also had a big play in the obstacles of the building of the empire state building
take your phone with you
my family will send emails back and forth with them
i think that there is a warm mood in the memoir
harry <caps> even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them
that was a story about he being patient at doctors office and for a <num> minutes thing
my concern is for the children who get a hold of these books
what they do not know is that if something is <caps> thats just going to make the kid want to go see it more
the world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books
but instead the architects assigned a shiny glass and chromenickel stainless steel tower and then designed the mooring mast
the library should give the child a certain amount of time to return the book
id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat
i waited patiently and i was praying he was alright
i got ready then we hit the road
which got <caps> the wrestler of the year awarded by my <caps> coach <person>
its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the empire state building
you have to think about the kids that are mature too
i told my brother and he called my dad
it was time to send my taste buds on vacation
the mood created by the author in the memoir could be strong to many people once they put it together
libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any schoolwork they have
the weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads
guess what it can do better then censorship
you disconnect yourself from your family
you can look up the weather for that time
therefore computer teach handeye coordination
and they can look up whatever they like
just about any domain name on the web
but i still sometimes have patience
to looking at websites
and talk to friends more easily
the heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly
with the computer my dad talks to them almost everyday
i know thats happened to me
we were almost in <caps> <caps> so i just turned on my <caps> and listened to music the rest of the way
the safety of the city became a concern
if it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it
computers also lead friendship torn apart
i am not a patient person
computers make you become become smarter
another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons
computers provide entertainment to people
the mood the author created in the memoir was happiness
the excerpt also <caps> that there were problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving
it is also very opening
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
the time i was patient
he ended up getting a <percent> on the test because he used a computer
we cannot control everything that people do
however this was not an easy task
also throughout the whole memoir you can feel the happiness when he talks about eating dinner with all his family members and friends
all sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around
the small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey
it also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in <location>
and to let the passengers on and off there also
and how a house can become a home and how important family and friends relationships are
in this story the setting affects the characters dramatically
another way to teach handeye coordination is through computer games
what if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff in a little writing
a second issue the were faced with is that it is in a city
i believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst
this shows the closeness of the people in the neighborhood had and this represents the love as well
he used several books to get information on the topic and i used the computer
i will <caps> remember this day because there were so many different stories i can tell from it
music on the other hand could be thought of as different
i know this by his statement
baseball is why i can bench press <num> pounds
we showed each other loyalty throughout <num> days
they never said what the books were but they kept talking about how they felt and what they would have liked to do with them
i wonted a ice cream cake
for me i think it is
we were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter
in the <location> hydrogen is used to fuel the dirigibles
as nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building
learning or big things like testing
some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them
the mood that the author was happiness
i have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of what were you thinking moments
laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and i
the author <caps> this mood with his quotes that <caps> puts in
my family and i began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us
people will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want
she is amazing and funny
these are only a few of the reasons why computers do good in our society
when people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got
i think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship
you can <caps> to peoples cellphones
this would also be dangerous for anyone aboard the airship
everyone have their own views and ideas on everything
<time> after my mom and my dad had gone to bed my sister and i had a <time> of watching movies and laughing our heads off
<caps> i think another mood of the author is definitely love
well the <organization> had to choose a side and the side that they have chosen that computer have a positive affect on people
i think you should pet on
we thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us
it is located over the pass about an hour from <caps>
it was a hot <date> day around three in the afternoon of course a donkey was the crowds favorite animal
with all of the wind the dirigible would be tugging back and forth on the building
anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique
this is why they should limit kids and adults to only <num> hours or less of computer time each day
laughter is important in my life for many reasons
not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on
the mood was also caring and friendly
i believe people should not spend <caps> much time on their computers because it can hurt their eyes
i think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect
he said we cant come out because we might distract somebody
this is why computers are good
before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family
most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was
this is another law that says citizens are allowed to think <caps> they will of anything
as long as hes reading thats all that matters to them
the builders of the empire state building were faced with producing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the buildings framework
the mooring mast would have stressed the building
i believe that computers are an major impact on people
then finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price
computers play a big role in society today
i do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and <month> find different types of work offensive
every book in one way or another would offend someone
i was laughing so hard i got a brain freeze
when they just take it off everything will be in grate shape
one that you can get in trouble for being impatient and get a step
and he could just be a bum
this modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars
by seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has
they help you keep in touch with friends and save you money
if we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world
and they will go out and do <caps> anyways
we were so loud i thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure
everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing
in the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to <location>
about <percent> of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life
one week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister
we need to be able to ask someone a quick question
schools influence computer use to help us learn
he is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion
everything must be taken with a grain of salt
read on so i could let you know how and why these things about the computer are helpful
i think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy
it was once said were there is a will there is a way
<person> had just took a drink of punch when i said <caps>
finally we convinced one of our classmates to do it
the blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain
we actually stayed for quite a few hours
it was a risk not worth taking
playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family
not just by talking on the phone
the smell traveled through our needy nostrils as we entered
i feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now
lastly you are able to find lots of information quickly and easily
the people it helps are kids in school to look up an area they need to find for a question on a worksheet
i understand that people do not want there kids to see them or hear them
at that time there was a law against any kind of aircraft to fly too low over urban areas
i had never done anything of the sort so i was somewhat excited
there is two things that are going to happen
these excerpts really sum up the authors <caps> about family
formed the backdrop to life in our warm home
this reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well
she picks up on the first ring
<caps> <caps> were going to do
<organization> looks down every aisle until she finally finds the pasta her <caps> wants
having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library
laughter is important to everyone
theres also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you
this is why computers are beneficial to the society
i slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope
computers can be very helpful to many people
the springtime is a representation of a new beginning
computers have caused problems where kids do not do any types of physical activity which deprives them of their daily needed exercise
then there is the man much torture
the author created such a specific mood for this memoir
every year we have a family reunion for two weeks
it really feels good when you laugh with a friend or a significant other
it was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph
this memoir gave me the feeling that just a house is not a home until there is love
<person> and i say <caps> sad pandas today we say that when we see that one of our <caps> is quiet or looks sad
two summers ago i went to <location> and <location>
there were many obstacles builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
one obstacle that faced the builders was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building
lastly computers are taking away family time
and they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on
my conclusion is that people should not to be able to get off of computer
he started cussing and hitting me
in my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done
music is a great thing that all age groups love
when people need help they read a book or look it up
some people are going a little bit too far when it comes to older teens
especially learning how to laugh about mistakes or situations to not get frustrated
songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about
my little sister is getting some thing like it but its some kind educational one
my mother got home and <caps> was nothing to say
<caps> when got to the checkout line there were a lot of people in line
one of the people i enjoy being around most is my best friend <person>
school or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were harsh
one time i was very patient
all of us start busting up laughing
and they are silly and they bite
it had a top like a water bottle would have
and some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited
these conversations have several effects on me sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better about things
the winds were shifting all the time so it was a very big safety issue
think about how <caps> someone <caps> really likes that
l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth
look at it and try to live life as you would in another persons shoes
these are some examples of the mood that was created
your computer cant get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one
laughter is <caps> my middle school years
when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself
this empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty
the teams were on different sides of my moms green suburban
i do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids
i bet most of the students in this world would say to keep them on the shelves because they like to read and look at pictures
after that day me and my best friend <caps> always laugh at that story
eventually we both fell asleep
i waited for the people in the <caps> next to me to get done with their turn and then i went up to bowl
the last time she came to see my older brother and i we went bowling
this would result in a in high grades
get out and get some fresh air
parents should not let there kid go to the library without them if they are scared for them to do something or look at something bad
censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer
another reason why the tone is grateful is because he says
people spend way to much time on the computer
one time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine
<caps> grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip
one time i was playing at the park with my friends i was playing soccer my friend told me to pass the ball
these are the greatest moments
another reason is to express the theme
everyone reached at my house around <num> pm
in the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways
i wish i could be patience everyday but cant do that
on the computer you can get any information about any information about anywhere or anything
after along <num> to <num> more hows of playing
all these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children cant reach them
laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons
i think that everyone should have a change of reading any book they want to
they can also read classics by great authors
some <month> find that <caps> <caps> or the <caps> of <person> are offensive books because of their repeated use of the <caps> word
i was so impatient i looked like i had ants in my pots
the builders of the empire stat building encountered both man made problems and problems from nature while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist
then after an hour the storm stopped and <caps> were able to board the plane
technical problems also arose
the government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society
you get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity
language usage in music is also a big deal
they think that they should get some books that are not found offensive
what some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life
now after many years it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote
especially if its in a middle school or elementary school
everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to
computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature
he had a sense of simple humor that created giggles in every corner of the class
this was my first major downfall in which i had successfully lost my humorous personality
they should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it
they are just not old enough or mature to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines
which means its harder to do because of how high it is
<num> years ago our immigration limit had ran out
just because someone else <month> find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf
so we decide to go up and ask what was going on
many features of the setting affect the cyclist
computer advances are bad for our country and town
it had opened <num> minutes ago
thats why most people are not healthy because of computers
her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying
the obstacles that were faced would put peoples safety at risk
if they even succeeded in docking then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around
you could do lots of other stuff than lay on the computer
if something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed
not all of them are for the eyes of every person out there
some parents might not want there kids to be exposed to this
once we got to the actual airport we still could not stop laughing <person> parents were getting frustrated with us even though we were making them crack up also
also he saw a snake that scared him to death but he passed the snake
those people now rudely look down on them
since i go to my local high school i think its nice to be able to find anything i need in my library at school
i was utterly shocked
i like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive
and those were for specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir
one other reason was a legal reason
to be able to say that means you have some pretty amazing neighbors
i do not want to be the same as everybody else
typing can help majority with this
navy dirigible reached the mooring mast
that description allows the reader to picture the warm culture of his childhood home
next i looked at the t
then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better
and i was talking with my sister <date> and <organization> and i fell asleep
my dog is <caps> and they are known for herding cows
then you go to search and put in <location> then all this <caps> of him comes out
the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building was unrealistic because there was a lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan
i am writing about a time when i was patient
laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship
i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots
if no one lived in a house it could never be called a home
the law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building
laughter brought me closer to my friend
and last get off the computer and go see your family and friends
i mean how could anything i say make that situation better or help her to feel better
learning about people will help you make friends to
i hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration
she will never know unless they meet us somewhere
me and <caps> were looking at it and it had a big hot tube bath bed king size bed i jumped on it and it was the best
most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium
some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed
i barely talked to anyone unless it was through email
she feels that right now shes likes the hibiscus
we started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall
that sort of crushed my reading spirit and i really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more
and <location> blimps were filled with helium
meant my grandpa where out on a hunting trip
i think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends
you have to expect that from kids now a days
you can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master
<caps> is in your heart <caps> always will be
the movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be <num> or older to go back there and look
one of these is the feature of setting
then i had to explain how patient i was
there only a couple people observing the other animals
he got up and walked over to the gym teacher
the workers had to take nature into effect
you want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does
the winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction
this basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want
the memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting
the victory of that nights game lead us one round deeper into the state tournament
another reason why i believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this
when voted one it could stay or be removed
they just finished the pull <caps>
a couple of days of not thinking and worrying about him did me good
this is how the computer can help you research any topic
that means that they want to be something when they grow up
the framework was not strong enough for this
after awhile of that i sit back and relax
once i got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds
another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below
meaning shell survive also
also the ornate mast would be difficult to raise on top of the empire state build due to the high winds
when little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section
you take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you
another obstacles were making the mooring mast of the empire state building to fulfill its purpose
imagine being in the hospital because of playing on the computer
<caps> about these two people who fall in love and their love lives
the setting in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit is used as an important for character development
if you are waiting to get a shot or life threat results
then i went inside and just sat there
even local doctors have pointed <caps>
we wasted all have on the shill will and i was waiting to play dodgeball all have
people have different opinions what one <month> find extremely offensive another <month> not care or even laugh at it
everyone has there own freedom
after that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination
i feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again
your body is special and your health is important
<caps> hugged me as <caps> had when i was four and broke my leg
they help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers
one day i was riding my bike and thought that i should stop pedaling and crash into my fence
she respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read
that section is only for mature people of the ages <num> or older
children have to learn these things some time in their life and i think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life
its not just cause there mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe
if you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more
the author of winter hibiscus ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes
the shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues
we were all ready done with the day before it had even started
the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus
i also managed to get all the information just from my computer
they allow people to contact others who are far away
it allows you to from your home
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the empire state building would have to
a flaming dirigible or a falling metal object at extreme heights would cause serious injuries because the landing is above a highly populated city
<caps> we <caps> my heart was pounding so hard i could hear it
having these documents in a public library could interest small children in reading things that are inappropriate for them
the look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless
it was this <date> we were going to this place in <location>
<num> out of <num> doctors agree that handeye very important for healthy living
the cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns
he apologizes and explains a couple things to me
even nature suffered from the advent of computers
but the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now
if someone is to write and publish a book then someone will want to read it
the author of this story created quite a mood in these few paragraphs
she wanted to drowned out the sound of <location> farts
my last argument is that people can talk to anyone using chat sites
there are many hills and the terrain changes a few times
i was doing a waterdepleting 12 mph
he envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub
<caps> you for letting me know that
there was this boy who made me smile and laugh
then on the way back we took another <num> <num> minutes on both trips it was boring
only in certain situations are peoples opinions actually taken seriously
some children go to the library without adult supervision and have freedom to check out whatever book they want
my mom was giving me all the steps on before starting the truck
when i got on the field realized i was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game
eventually the sun started to set and we made a fire by the side of the <caps> and roasted marshmallows over it
the information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant
we were driving to <location> <caps> and i was getting antsy
my dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did
i was having a hard time understanding the math
i told my little sister <caps>
i always have lame jokes so i was nervous about telling it to his parents
his life seemed like more of a routine and i was curious to find out why
they even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school
my third reason is when people do go on all they do is eat junk food and get no exercise
outside there is great things to do like go to the park or play sports
many people can only express themselves in their art and art can be very real
i believe it can mean many different things for many different people
but if they want learn the easy way its aways the hard way
because we are all the same
the winds also would make just getting to the empire a hazardous job
all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
i know i can i said to myself as i was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself
this shows prof of the projects incapability to be built
i <caps> his style and the way he sets up his jokes
little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff
it went through <num> appointments
<person> was getting was getting closer
to me that sounds like <caps> because he knows he can always come home to his parents if he ever need help
the author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending
they are required by some to enjoy a good book
there are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above
is sure i would have had across time if went people have probably done
books provide so much information on almost every subject known to humankind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one
in a study it showed that <percent> of people in the world has a computer as a communication tool
kids and teenagers can also use them for studying
that is why i think it is not right to spend all your time on the computer
we drove <location> to <location> and headed east towards <organization>
that was a time i was very patient
we jumped up and down and got on trophy
all of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the empire state building
so my answer is no about taking things away that are not censored
i think this conflict represents the <caps> way of life in itself
hours later of trying to keep him warm <person> arrived
that you need to do something
when he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated
even if we do this there could always still be away
some books in libraries offended some people
this had meant it was very flammable which was something the must consider
there is also a law forbidding aircraft flying to low over populated areas
also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off
<caps> ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for adaptation
for a cyclist every thing becomes more serious
thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on
many people become addicted to computers
secondly learning you can learn a lot on a computer all you have to do is look for it
we laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work
people can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like
the author also sets a love filled <caps> because of how open his family was to other people
they all carried for each other and were happy
libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library
the main conflict with this issue is how different everyones restrictions are
help us to became someone important in life
shouted the announcer
while <caps> walking to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away
as you can see those were some obstacles builders faced
computers can help everyone connect with anyone <caps> you can see computers have so many positive effects on people
man cant know everything
the author did not put any negative information in the memoir and only put a positive feeling
they can and most likely will come to your house for you
she realized that things come and go but also change
the youngest one is <location>
i darted my eyes in her direction again
with the use of <caps> or a
the author also describes what the dirigible would do as an affect of the wind
<caps> need computer to help us with research
once when me my dad were supposed to go to the races
wind was another harsh factor for the construction of the empire state building itself
he does grate in school too
laughter is one of the most important elements in ones life
these things are why the mood of the memoir is loving and grateful
computers especially help out college students
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
i show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis
when i got my bow i was very very very excited
when class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself
after you settle in and are being quite the wood come alive all around you
when the teacher was helping me they sat and quietly did there work
that will not stop me with helping my friends in the future
books should be the same way
books need to stay on the shelves
first the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot making it hard to pedal
the tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died
<person> and i were laying on opposite ends of each other
if you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you
i think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library
i ran to the kitchen where my parents were
here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance
my brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made
i would just get attitude
but yet he would never get directions from any oldtimer again
but one time l really had to use my patience
there is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your <caps>
the winter is the current season and spring is on its way
so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing
we all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when i am cooking
another example is that in school kids have a choice of what electives the want to take
so in other words my family and i had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes
i m one of those people
computers is a little device that can almost let you do anything on it
so i started to get angry i went to the couch and sat their and watched <caps> while my dad was eating
this brings up the <caps> of <caps>
after the <caps> got removed i went home to sleep
however the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the <caps> side
i think that computers have great affects on people
that was one time i was patient but not the only time
i was gazing out the window of the small classroom while <person> kept talking
the guy apologized to my dad and i
i would have to say that it was a very good ice breaker
we all got something to eat because we were all hungry then we watched a little <caps> then headed to bed for the night
the democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government
it can help you get through hard times
please consider my opinions the right way
i was patient the whole time
some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies
this will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read
not everyone has the same opinion on things
when she got in the ca we were off
censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy
the author could write a sequel to this one
patience is also about waiting
we finally got on the bus and headed home
we always laugh about how we started talking
computers are a good benefit to society they you to talk to people give different for you the the latest updates
you can learn about all this and more if read on
the ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black
the removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help
sometimes we record t
the cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain
i cant wait to get to that paragraph
laughing is actually health and is a form of excursive
also if you are in the army and have a <organization> baby you can watch as they take their first steps or say their
it was one of the hardest things i have ever done in <caps> life
bead all the about computers and you will think but like me
i now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often
i remember a time when i had to display patients for a long period of time
the big problem that it faced was the wind speeds that high up in the air
the third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas
<num> more it was time to go home my dad and i was tired beyond help
the <caps> mood in this memoir is being grateful
the winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable
even people want to know where are some people from
so him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying
were starting to bleed
that could waste a lot of time
kids should not leave there area for a <caps> book
it is the sign of happiness and gratefulness
the biggest obstacle was nature itself
he was a very patient man although we got on his nerves
bottom line is that you have free will and you have to power to choose weather or not you want to read something
i cant think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read
they would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books
so for that they always kept their arms and door wide open to people they considered family
in the excerpt the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there
she tried to stick it out but things got worse and worse
many of these features affect him in a negative way
thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her
patience makes perfect
i remember one time when i first started going outside i had so much fun
no water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going <caps> water
movies like this should be banned from public libraries
computers let you talk your you right
the last obstacle that the builders faced was the shift in air currents on top of the building
except that night they had a really big fight after they thought all of us had gone to bed
another example in paragraph <num> where is says i will neverforget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
it was raising and many people wanted to see if <caps> would close down
that hard in life there is going to be a lot of hard things in life
maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher
some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves
the author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason
imagine what else could happen by staying of computers
after about <caps> minutes she called us in to a medical room
i would have to say that the reason <person> and i became friends is because of laughter
if it is a bad day then they will not want to but probably will
it has a playful tone with a warm and loving mood
one was alive and lasted <num> minutes then died
not even a library has all the information you need
the pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about <num> feet in the sky and if they messed up they could potentially die
<num> out of <percent> of <caps> family members and friends agree with <caps> mom
the same case with my mom
over <money> worth of changes had to be made to the framework
i could do it and sure enough i could
we all waited tentatively as he chomped down on the moist bun and swallowed
another problem is lack of exercise
i know that there are so many things that could offend people
<caps> how the stress factors on the building troubled its construction
patience is a valuable thing
i like discovering things on my own
a computer is anyones passport to leisure and enjoyments
spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease
they remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks
this what i get out as the last paragraph are the story winter hibiscus as what it means to me
but the bad thing was that <person> was still in love with <person>
the author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test
at the mall my mom told <person> and i to meet her back at food court around two
she said no save your little money that you have
<caps> looked like a great horse that listened to its rider
when the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes i believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost
the weather affected the use of the mooring mast because the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
later that day i rode my bike over to <caps> house and thought about what to write
<person> said to the kid they you know you have to go to the back of the line right
the wind was the most obvious flaw in the landing dock because of the rough wind currents at the top of the building
the blimps were unable to be used because they were a major safety issue for the people being transported
about half of the people are talking to friends who live in another state
my mother would not let me read the <organization> books when i was younger
when we went to the <organization>
a child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost
<caps> is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not
dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights
after reading this information and the descriptions
there are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection
to prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it
i had been there a lot that <date> and i was pretty familiar with their selection so i was looking for something new
he states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the <location> for him as well as making his house feel like a home
i was waiting patiently for my mom
it would have cost sixty thousand dollars worth of modification had to be made to the framework
and i rolled my eyes and walked away
if you replace it with slave that statement or passage loses its power on its readers
but then my phone rang once more
world communication has also opened up many business opportunities
then just ignore it and go on
usually when you have laughter in the relationship it will make it last longer
i was happy i made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst
later that night i showed my mom i could do it
computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places
spending long hours on my computer had caused me to become
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the first obstacle was the forceful winds
you can use this to talk to friends and many on line
books are vital to learning things
they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong
it can help you find long lost family
it was very entertaining
we just have to raise them the best we can
you might be able to see how an <caps> household runs
one challenge included was the fact of the wind from such an altitude as the empire state building made situations perilous for blimps and people on the ground
without ever leaving their state
another thing you can do is learn about recent events
<caps> time to step away from the computer and into real life before <location> gets demolished by these effects computers cause
mostly teenagers have this problem
<person> said how the door nob fell off
and exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise
the shelves would be blank
books are essential part of life
because hes talking about how his family started and how <caps> met his friends
the computer can take us anywhere
four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and <num> out of those four people have had at least one account hacked
when they are older they might actually like them
he learned a lot and we were all proud
the essay takes place in the early summer
these were the moods created by the <caps> in this memoir
this resulted in <money> worth of modifications to the foundation
this reminds her of her old home watching the geese
since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those things are gone
one day a kid was going to school <caps> was going to turn in a paper for math <caps> <caps> did
or possibly you could be talking to some of your really close friends who live just across town
in the following i want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries
people should have the option to read or watch what they wish
computers have become a part <organization> our everyday life
patience can be used in <caps> in experiments <caps> could also be used in math to find an answer
i am a person that believes theres two parts to every story
these two opinions can cause an intriguing argument
whatever the case maybe they should feel comfortable in the place they are at
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful
<caps> got off waiting when it would come
the computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that <month> be brought up in a class room
heart disease is caused by obesity
books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer
i do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books
it is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same
<caps> a fast and easy way to communicate
you can also have conversations through email with no problem
the reader <month> not like the topic but others would and thats always good to think about
outdoors are just <caps> fun <caps> <caps> <caps> <num>
search <caps> up on <caps>
a time when i was patient
another reason the author <month> have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit
my life was perfect before i had my brothers my parents and my love of my life
there are a few reasons for this
there would be no music to listen to
she gives off a calm relaxed feeling
those are the people that i grew up with and have known since birth
<caps> as <caps> the computer is letting you teach yourself
there is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all
the boys were well liked and had great lives
one of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest
the only time they let us stay long is when we maybe doing a project for school
people are starting to see no point in going out and doing things because there are more important things to do on the computer
the passage explained that the winds above the empire state building would shift violently and frequently
another thing that the computer offers is handeye coordination
a single cable tether held the dirigible and it would add stress to the buildings frame
when i think about that day i still laugh
it signaled to me that they all must be happy together
i was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others
i believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries
the constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well
censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive
computers make people develop hand eye coordination
it was the new neighbor kid
an example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places
one problem they faced was that most of the dirigibles made outside of the <person> used hydrogen rather than helium
i waiting i was looking forward staring at the silent audience
second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature
people can always have an email for business and friends
you just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely
people are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family
this is true that you could use the phone and call them out you have to pay for long distance
lets say i was in the library and i did see something offensive
one of the reasons that mooring a dirigible on the top of the building is most dirigibles that would come to this dock from outside the u
the reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling
the dry desert affects the cyclist the most
the computer is used a lot for researching
now the <caps> needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary
if this happened the dirigible would crash into the empire state building or other building
i choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to
mom said <caps> you need to be patient like the other parents
most dirigibles from outside of the u
when they came to pay the bill <person> began panicking
people know their limits and if they know the contents then they should stay away
another main cause was the wind current on top of the empire state building
i wonder how do people come up with these ideas
i think the description of the setting enhanced the readers perception of the cyclists journey
now you know that i was patient and was hurt all day
who are we to tell people what they can and cant write down
i rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on <person> face
the cars were going so fast around like you could feel the bleachers shake
<caps> is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do
in a matter of fact it got worse
that is unfair and should be stopped
and <person> and my brother <caps> dying from the wait
at that point we were up <num> and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half
i think that these are all very important
you cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer
there is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer
it also effects him because he had an advantage
i think that everyones opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library
i told her many time to calm down everything was going to be alright
we began the climb and i began <caps> talk <caps> her
before this project was started the builders should have researched or accounted for all the obstacles they were going to face
in the story he told the many sacrifices his parents made to give him a better life than the one they had
i waited for a hour then i got my turn
the <caps> of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there
my best friend <location> is the funniest girl i have ever known
<caps> i was just scratching my head
i had finally got a reward for being patient all these years
my group went on all of the big scary rides
the environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways
m you can talk to your friends easily
i stepped foot out side and entered my apartment and went straight to my bleakly colored room
so the whole ride their and back i waited patiently
one of them tried to take some pieces and i guess to the other one he was taking too long
tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill
as i see it no one is forcing them to read it
<caps> is grateful that his parents did that for him
allowing dirigibles was going to be the new way of transportation back in the 1920s
because this plant reminds her so much of her old home
there should not be censorship on books in schools
by the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water
<caps> often say that they are stressed and depressed
dear <caps> <caps> <caps> i believe it is true many people use computers and that many more will use them in the future
the reason for this is because if your writing an email then you should know the keys that your fingers touch
i will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home
a great thing to use on a computer is a web cam
it really does work on your hand and eye coordination
to conclude that when i have to have patience in class
event though they are almost adults
another reason is they stayed very close with their family
on evening we decided to watch a movie
all <caps> you will need to multi task like at a library you need to find a book and talk to people
one way is that the rolling hills <month> let the rider get more tired
those was some affects the cyclist had to over come
many things on the cyclist journey affected him
i threw the first water balloon at <location>
they could be talking to one of their family relatives
communicating with elder relatives who cant speak <caps> was a lot harder then i had thought
teens can be influenced by anything and whats worse is that it can start at the library
i believe that the book that none of us read
brings everything back full circle
hes very proud of how he lives
these are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries
some <month> be fond of other genres and some <month> dislike the other genres
one obstacle was that a lot of dirigibles outside the <location> use hydrogen over helium
we each have our own specific reasons for using them
this started to affect <person> relationship with <person>
immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis
this is problem in the country because if we become lazy then we could ruin our country
you just have to be over <num> to go in that area and with an adult
if citizens keep sitting there then we will became unhealthy
because the more they just sit around
all of these culture came together in a great solitary and friendship
computers can affect people in many ways
patience is tough to achieve sometimes
i feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others
you get completely <caps> guard <caps> just cant help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are
i bowled and i waited
the first problem they encountered was that when moored at the top of the building the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame
i think computers really do benefit society here in why
formed the backdrop to life in our warm home
i would always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
<caps> grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket
and by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful
at times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world
they are the ones how want to go the rated <caps> movies or get a rated <caps> video games that have offensive language
that they themselves have purchased to get
adults mostly use them for business
obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds a weak structure and public safety
and we all liked that name
the author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community
i got into the car first
this story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture
and last was the differences in gases used to keep the blimps afloat
lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults
even though <person> will never see her grandpa <caps> again she will always have him with her
i also love to make others laugh
as they tried to run away they tripped over themselves and started to roll all <caps> while they were being stung by the wasps
it said the flowers leaves quivering in the wind
i have to look at it
then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
they should just be put in their own area for adults to read only
she once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again
the passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone
there are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people
with a computer all you need to do <caps> to type in what info your looking up
there are many benefits to having a computer
i know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work
in my personal opinion i do <caps> think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold
i knew <caps> hard long she had studied for that test
they said yes so after waiting <num> minutes and then nobody wanted to play anymore
we also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most
every time i go to get my hair cut it is a lot of people in the <caps> shop
they give you access to an amazing amount of information
i think this <caps> messing people up
this special area should be clearly marked with a sign that says <caps> content and should only be able to be viewed by adults
so i can have the laughs that i want now
or use it to plan vacations
the sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer
setting plays a crucial part in the cyclists mood and energy
we get to the dunes unload everything get our riding gear on and our helmets with our goggles on
in some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see
most dirigibles from outside the <location> used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable
<caps> is one reason why i think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature
i do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well
but in the end he found some water and the story ended fine
the construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required over <num> dollars worth of modifications and a lot of time and planning
people should have their own choice
just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else
we have had less visitors than ever before
computers should be used less
i know a kid named <person> who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over
for example they write <caps> <caps> going <num> dance
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
the heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way
if a person took offense from a book or magazine i believe that person should just put it back
the cyclist was in a bad situation
it read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate
i love <caps> little brother
<date> really brought us back together again
another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers
and there was no shade are place for him to top and get some water
she ends with that paragraph because it starts over
these weights were used for open landing fields
you have no right to take that away from someone
i had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip
i think that this is very important because <percent> of people that the computers leads people to become antisocial
<caps> know how your partner is feeling can make all the difference
people could then read these comments before checking out that item
so the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels
which they went on to say it would add stress to the building so they had to fix that
people need to communicate through computer a lot
and computers can help you prevent those things that are bad for you by showing you ways to use computer that wont harm you
she was nervous but with the help of her <caps> she sit and talked with her father
we all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun
nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires
the parents point of view makes things a lot worse
removing a book from a library would be done through ones opinion
magazines these days are even worse
the fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind
it was obvious she did not belong up there
those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer
then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the empire state building
she loves to laugh but her boyfriend hates making jokes
computers also of for the average
the weather also created a great risk
<num> out <organization> <num> people who store <caps> their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do <caps>
we had just gotten done watching <caps> <caps> and were super hungry for lunch
this way other people can read these books
we all follow in a pack down the street until we show up at <organization>
they allow friends and family who live far away from each other to communicate and stay in touch
another obstacle was nature itself
the sight was troubling
i know this from some clues in the text
she should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do
i has so many information in it you wont even think a person it
many obstacles had gotten in the way of the builders in attempting dirigibles to dock there
i believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that <month> be far away
laughing is great for your heart and mind too
i can even see how my cousin in <location> is doing
some people prefer <caps> rated movies or music with explicit content
in my opinion i think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to
<caps> could tell that his parents love him very much and <caps> is grateful for that
there were plenty of problems engineers at the empire state building faced when they wanted to dock dirigibles
you waste over <num> days a year sitting in front of your computer
that i went to doctors
she misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers
this is another reasons why computers a good
it also looks this time was one of his bes time
building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building
in the <caps> it <caps> stated that we have the freedom of press and speech
though it was an accident it still happened and it can be prevented and it should be prevented for the sake of the children
a final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature
i was worried because it was going to be a long trip home
bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences
when i came back out i thought what can i do
now i know some people <month> not have grown up hearing foul words but many of us have
take a book that refers to slavery and what they use to call black <caps> back then
the amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house
when using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright <caps> lights
that was definitely an obstacle they had to face
the can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know
i went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when i come back out she already had two puppies
said <caps> as he ran around me
it reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role
then my family and i left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground
then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found
<person> casted his line as far as he could get it to go
but i think what we are talking about here is the joyful kind
just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someones world
the cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me
but i wont it now not in <num> months
she realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail
many people go on vacation and what brought them here has when they sat and places
for this reason even older such as <person> find computers weird
everybody came back outside to play around with it
it was here that i learned the definition of family
but also like the geese she will go back her face hardships again
<person> blushed and asked him if he wanted to swing for a while
which helps in most cases
it can bring people together or even tear people apart
sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications
the winds would make the ship sway back and forth which would be extremely dangerous
sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody live that close
to conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves
we all were laughing and then we all stopped at the same time and because we all stopped at the same time we all started laughing cause <caps> was funny
even if that includes some of them being offensive
there are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves
<person> wagged her tail looked at me and looked back under the car
i say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood thats really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care
after the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while
now think to yourself would you risk taking away someones favorite book
i have been to the library as a child and seen all the books there
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding
clearly the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building
a time when i was patient was on the city bus
i remember when i <caps> younger me and my friends always wanted to go see <caps> rated movies
so now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school
there is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercise
the author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist
magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander
by no time i was at the office yes i said to the person that was there do you now why your hear <caps> said no i replayed
usually i get so nervous i forget to say the body of the speech
behind some movies or books there is are violence and bad scenes
the mood of this duration is very warm and happy
i rarely have patience i cant wait more than around ten minutes for something
i think the music of <date> is a big problem because the lyrics can be very offensive
it gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see
which made me look on the positive and lighthearted side of things
then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school
a good movie would be <caps> <caps> <caps>
nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured
the builders of the empire state building <caps> many different obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
parents always kept their arms and door open to many of the people
by the tone of the narrators voice shows that
some might find it offensive and others <month> not
the obstacles the builders fact was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
one day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section
you could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew
laughing in a relationship is good because if you cant laugh together you probably not be together
the plan was <organization> and i were going to pretend to be in a fight and <person> was going to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me
i usually storm of in the middle <caps> cause i cant take anymore
i know this because i will never forget how my parents turn to the simple house into a home
there are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework
the story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect
you can talk to people long distance
they also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines
she started to turn beatred
i remember when we went for a walk to a pond to find alligators
as i searched <caps> room <num>
a person like that can succeed in life
or in rare cases the parents are the cause of it
the fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people
the books are trusted and filled with information
<caps> my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back
their are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things
they noticed after the masts construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city
it took me a while to picture who it was but eventually i realized who it was
there it is with the date exactly
to block any part of this experience <caps> to block our full potential
computers help students with homework and projects and they help communicate with other people
she never wanted to exercise or doing anything active
i jogged to her house down the block and we long boarded down to <person> in downtown <caps>
i look who they are from at <num> all from <caps> dad
if you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question
if you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature
the cyclist was lost in the dessert
setting <caps> the cyclists physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story
i know this because my eyes start to hurt
we made a boring moment fun
i believe that children should have the right to know about some things but not all
we went to this fancy restaurant i cant pronounce
i believe all books would be fine left on shelves
teachers always have there homeworks listed on a school web page
if we did not have computers we would not learn the same
in fifth grade i had to do this really hard project
we put in behind the store and our mom left after telling us to be safe
another obstacle during his trip are the hills
this was the time i was patient
to prove there over twenty <caps>
quickly i turned away
i always wished that i could go back in time and relive <caps> childhood
i am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and is relationship
the area around the building was too densely populated
a second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock
these are the books i remember
thats the mood of the author in the memoir
therefore i believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good
the setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp
<caps> <caps> <caps> <caps> i want <caps> go get icecream
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
you can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job
some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills
at least thats <caps> i think
for movies i think they should have an age limited for children
he states that he grows up learning that family has nothing to do with being a blood relative
its too bad i underestimated how wild they were
then finally <caps> made it only <num> minutes late
the library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age
another example is when i was a freshman
music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored
overall there are many reasons why the mooring mast never became a reality
both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground
there is still more that a computer can do
the author include s the last paragraph to show that she still has hope
this made it hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely
if you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it
some people should think that school should not read <person> due to racism in the south
if you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it
those are some obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
and there is nothing that can stop people from talking
i had to force myself to get up and say hello
books are put in libraries for peoples pleasure and love for reading
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy setting
some girls forget to ask their parents and it buss me because there is only two days left
<caps> just sitting at home watching movies
safety was another problem
my second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other
<caps> mans trash is another mans treasure
would add stress to the buildings frame
another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts
everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end
she helped me pick up all my math homework <caps> picked up my schedule <caps> saw that she too had choir this period
the same rules apply with books and music
the author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by
a while back my mom had decided to send me to <date> camp
i have seen a little kid pull a adult book of the self
books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive
i was living in <location> at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to the <location> for one <date> as an exchange student
thats why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help
some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view
this is why i think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie
the <caps> is that people should agree
the libraries also would not have to worry about people being offended
if materials are offensive they should not be displayed
the quotation all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
i am against censorship in libraries and i hope you are too
they were all amazing homemade houses
everyone was making eye contact with me
but she did not get mad
another obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced was the law forbidding air vessels of flying too low over urban areas
the builders and architects had to find a way to allow the stress to travel down the foundation of the building
i was ready but my coach said no
one way a comedian does an act is stand up comedy
computers are very great to have around
the author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out
soon we will become the leader of <location> and we will get to the decisions around
other rides we want on too had a long wait
i looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears
i knew this was different tho
computers teach handeye coordination and allow people to learn information from all over the world
in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks
kids can learn more but they spend too much time on line
this quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous
that is why the author concludes with that
<person> had thrown a big water balloon at her that knocked her out of line
i suddenly stopped laughing at all because i thought laughing alone would look stupid
we worked out at the gym <date> for four hours each day
actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelfthat work i abhorthen you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
so i watched the clock tick down over so slowly
for example your friend live the other side of the globe you an your computer and message so you can still talk to them all the time
the authors interpretation of their childhood home set a mood of love and compassion
this makes it much easier than to fly half way across the <organization>
another place to be patient was when i had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel
the paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year
a little bit earlier i played the game
so that why computers help out so much in this lifetime
off people exercising out with time in the computer which is unbelievable and terrible
plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing
put a smile on your face and turn your frown upside down and laugh
they allow you to store information
<caps> left feeling like a good person because he was patient with the woman
she cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out
i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
my mom is very patient women and a great teacher and leader
go experience nature
i think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week
what is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another
then he battled ninjas
it creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away peoples freedom to make decisions for themselves
this supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because the author expressed their opinions in there own way which set the mood
while i was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck i sat there very bored
when i was little we went to <organization>
my mom was very nervous
they were coming over to our house to play bored games
it gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad
he was extremely proud and grateful to his parents to teach him all these
<caps> sits down <caps> the ground
computers solve problems that some people might not now about
in the <organization> every single person has the freedom of speech
it was a pitching barn
in fact hardly any will
well theres one of the reasons and i <caps> when my parents were kids that they had no computers and they went outside to enjoy nature
that is why computers have a good effect on people today
we did everything together
sure i think i am so mad that she thinks she can <caps> can and it would be all better
a computer has information about anyone you chance
i am a dancer at <organization> of dance
you just sit there staring at a screen
it was about second grade when we became <caps>
laughter makes us forget about it
this was a <caps> because of the high speed winds at the building shifting all the time
thanks to a close friend
go get some fresh air
how cool is that <caps> reading this letter and sharing it to your company i believe that you should support my cause
most of those people are <date> of age
the mood of this memoir is <caps>
she is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge
then your friend said <caps> playing games
he says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and sacrifice
computers have become something that people depend on
talk them into becoming racist towards others
<person> was your average fourteen year old
sure enough here came <person> <person> rite behind her was <person>
as he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out
to make his building the tallest in the world he added the mooring mast
in the <date> dirigibles were considered the transportation of the future
at times i have my bad times and need some laughter in my system to make me feel at least better
they would be dangling high above people which would not be safe
the heart of their home is the kitchen because they all love to cook
more over he was in a desert area
mother nature herself was also a problem
that special day we were supposed to start our state writing tests
sometimes i am but sometimes <caps> not <caps> going to tell you a story when i was patient when <caps> normally not patient in situations like this
when going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help
they help people learn new stuff about things and
this made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people
patience is a very important thing to me
remove a book from a shelf is like decrease from knowledge that could have been known
without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily
i think that would be unfair to do that
the music of this world is very diverse
you can see here the positive effects of a computer
its not accomplishing anything
another factor that goes with this is the wind currents
after she had talked and discussed the basics of <caps> <caps>
that is why i believe their should be censorship in every library
they were incredible two story oak made houses that look like they could take a tornado coming out with only scratches
<caps> i walked over to where <caps> pointed <person> looked around thinking that <organization> crazy <person> <caps> just seeing things
i was patient at the clinic so then we spent <num> minutes
this is going to be my first opinion
labels such as <caps> or <caps> are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision
i have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away
they are an excellent tool for all ages
when surrounded by new digital age
another way to speak to friends or family is a website called <caps>
at least you getting up to get the phone
i feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion
the builders of the empire state building also came across an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas
movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for
that has yet to become the problem
the ticket id been dying for was actually mine
also because of everything that could happen to the building
the builders of the empire state building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles
another thing that needs to be removed is racial material
i asked my mom if we can go home she said no
the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country
the anger in his voice was excruciating
i was hoping my <caps> day would start out good
when we got there we found a spot to sit on the ground
the budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower
one of his moods is that he is happy
having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life
computers do not benefit our society today
i was hungry so i told my mom she asked me if i wanted to go out my cat i said sure and went and got my jacket on
a second reason is it generally makes everything <caps>
the purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners
people should not have the complete say in the removal of books
they should not grow up to fast like some people are
sometimes laughter is a very important part in someones life
the winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live
he tells of the courage his mother and father had of coming to the country without any knowledge of the language or culture
how is that fare to others who might like it
second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama
this shows the parents love for the kids
until this one day came she called and <num> was kind of busy because there were people over are house
some parents wont let their children watch certain things on the t
for the next mile or so we continued without finding a map
on our way home we danced around in the backseat and sang to all of the songs that we knew
i ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water
the dog was running so fast that the fur on its face was pushed back and it looked like it was going to rip off
my little brother is holding on to my hand so tight that his little knuckles turn white
<caps> is ready and so <caps> do this thing i muttered as i grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood
i talked to the people who have just started to use computers and <num> out of <num> people said that they had liked what they had seen
that just invites the reader in
after a while of playing we decided to go on one of the water well <caps> was the water well at the park
i believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time
this proves that his life in new jersey at his house helped him realize the true meaning of family
i am not a very patient person
i disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why
while this <month> be true for some people it is not true for <caps>
computers give us a bright future
most people would not even call that a library
books about abortion give us an idea about how horrible it is or how it can not only effect the women who go through with it
i quickly ran to <caps> dad and told him about <caps> problem
almost everyone in this world reads
the last obstacle was a law
and moving the to the back closet
our <caps> class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by then
the empire state building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships
so i gave her a dollar
laughing makes memories
the heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke
can you imagine having to drive to peoples houses just to talk to them
the conclusion sentence of winter hibiscus is one of realization of opportunity with spring beginning
<person> has a gift to make anything funny at any time
<caps> can mend the broken bridges between people and even make awesome relationships even better
censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history
as i stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement
i believe this because at one point in time my older brother and i did not get along very well
my opinion is that people should have computers in their homes
the look on my mom face could never be replaced <caps> was so proud of me
censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long
the reasons listed above tell you why i believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose
i got the red kind cause it the best
its a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you
they came back <num> later
we had to leave all of our family and friends behind
there were very strong winds that were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
for example when the author says their were no cars nor buildings in sight that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere
i start laughing uncontrollably then <caps> dad starts cracking up
stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured
to stall healthy people need to be outside and exercise
another obstacle the builders failed to see was the actual construction of a modernday dirigible
one of the people who worked at <organization> said that we could not run in the building
his brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting on foot in front of the other
he went for a ride on the neighborhood trails
and the library need more style for the people are excited and take the books and read
laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance
that book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read
she put a smile on her face
another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational
doing <caps> when <caps> was easy you will also get a better grade
libraries should not be censored
we should be able to communicate to our friends and family <num> out of <num> people in our school think having a computer is good
<caps> any dirigibles could never tie up the the building because of this new law
those children then start to ask other adults and children
that mood is happy and friendly
certain items have different forms to them
the climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building
there are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today
he then shows up an hour later with a couple gallons of gas
the show is full of really puny and dumb humor but it fit all three of us
<person> and i pull the dirt bike out of the old spiderweb infested shed
finally <caps> stepped out of the vehicle
people just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others
movies that are <caps> rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie
as we made up a game called <caps> we found that we had a lot of similar interests and also we laughed at the same jokes
and instead of spending ten minutes in a dictionary
i know that i have made friends over the years that have moved away and that i have lost touch with
i do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive
i have read and seen a lot of books in my life time
there are people out there that think somethings should be taken off the shelves or not even made
every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects
for my first reason goes along with personal values
being serious about everything is not always a good thing
also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that
i picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and exercise your bones will become weak
i actually think its a good idea about people being on their computers
we <month> throw away a moving song because of its lyrics
<caps> you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant you <month> use a computer so you know how far
now thats why computers are straight entertainment
face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do
there is also caring and selflessness
one of these ideas is using the empire state building as a mooring mast for dirigibles
somethings on the shelfs in books stores and other places can be very offensive
the ones that teach us about life and society
the features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist
this setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water
one reason why dirigibles could not moor the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas
the other boys at school would laugh at <organization> for being so much smaller than themselves
there are relaxed moods to explain the feelings he had for his life and there was even harsh moods to show the tough times they went through and such
these books were penned to educate our civilization
computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there
obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it
i believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles
this story is not about what i wanted its about patience
there is this one thing about computers that remains constant
its good to defend yourself
the reason why i say that is because we should be able to but what ever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way shape or form
this memoir is based on the definition of family
not just the year and a half id known him
parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much
the setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation
with a computer these are some things that you will be able to do
he this means that he needed water so much and the hill was so big that he needed water
even i lose my patience some times
reason why i think you have family from far away
these reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans
you eventually memorize where all of the keys are located
i waited all the way to <num> to get my hair cut
i think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
my opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too
a third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication
its a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it
wow does he look small next to that truck
that would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands
this shows that the tone is thankful for what the parents had done and love them at the same time
eventually we would all get lunch and go out to the park near the river right next to the <caps>
you can write a visual letter to one of your friends
he would get tired out faster
so she wont now other
the first sentence in paragraph <num> says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over
also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket
the impossibility of the plan was realized for there were too many obstacles to face
our daily lives would be dull and boring without new technology
<person> was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar
this features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind
family and friends and even mental health
we also are doing our part to destroy the environment
well the computer is a great source for learning about these places
i had never been in the position she was in
i absolutely hate sitting on the bench
after the ceremony <person> and i threw a party
i introduced myself to her and she told me her name was <person>
<caps> said with a smile
there were two attempts to dock on the building
his gratitude and love towards his parents just warms the readers heart
libraries can help us in many different ways
not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials
my first reason is natural disasters
it was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where i celebrated my first birthdays
then i saw him run past and before i knew it i leaped off the ground and waved frantically
how are we suppose to teach history without telling the whole story
yeah i said you think a comp
these games also make you more intelligent
we argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there
being a spy was one of the most hardest and funniest things that <person> and i ever did at the library
you can find information fast
some people feel the need to disagree and say computers are bad for people
the journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one
they will want to know
that was long after my <caps> left and went back to the adults
you know people that like to travel to far away places and have fun would rather that than waste their time on a computer
<caps> local library closes at <time> pm
sometimes using the computer could be educational
probably not the two you would think
i do think in some cases then they should have to say why they want that certain material just to determine it is for all the right reasons
in the excerpt the mooring mast the builders faced many obstacles
if this is the case i think that its not the right thing to do
a lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day
we can not escape the diversity in which we live in
i was always so caught up in laughter that i never had time to think about the negative
why did i have to fall history
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
this is because she types and researches information all day long
so think about going on the computer all day and night
and we all knew that before she told us
if you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories
that is one less hour of exercise
all types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that
another obstacle the builders had to deal with was the greatest obstacle in paragraph <num>
computers are just plain bad
because complaining will more than likely do something about it
computers are a magnificent part <organization> society
i rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them
my eyes stink when i am on the computer for half an hour
even if the ship would land their it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even approach the area
violence is very harmful for children
this would cause many problems and face many obstacles
offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age
that is why i think laughter is important and it does really make any relationship stronger
i was really exited to go
the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give you an idea of how she feels about what happened to her
i think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together
the next morning at <num>
it also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family
the violent air currents at these heights would cause the dirigible to swerve around the mooring mast
movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence
my opinion is that the computer help a lot is something like need in our life
being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated
and for which i am eternally grateful
my opinion on movies however are a little different
there is something about music that soothes the human body
libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out
hoping she would find him attractive and let him text her
one of the obstacles faced was that putting a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame
he also says some of the people who became depressed start thinking of suicide
it took him around <num> minutes because he needed help with a lot of thing
another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction
after getting some helpful advice about a few short cuts the cyclist sets out for adventure
i hope this helps you with you questions about how computers effected people
i asked my mom if we could leave but the line was to big to get out
offensive books should <caps> be there to only distract the teenager from school
computers are a tool that need to be used in an everyday life
in <caps> <num> <caps> says there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are
most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections
children spend most of their time on games than studying
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
one time i was taking the <caps> test we had a very long time to the different parts on the test
they going to hear it anyways so why try to stop it when there going to end up hearing it
we also go to the library to read the newest book of a series
my dad was patient and that is unusual because he is normally in patient
you could be out there getting to were your relatives live to see them
a sport that requires a lot of this is <caps>
this is a story about a time when i was being patient waiting for a plain in an airport
we all need some laughter in order to not be depressed and sad
one obstacle in docking dirigibles was the framework of the building
winds made the blimps very unstable
this is not a hard decision to make
that was the time i realized that i had been patient
people are now these days
<caps> was really that hot
to do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn
the computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy
there is always a good side to every situation
you can play all the music you want
this law made it illegal for ships to even go near the empire state building
that is my last reason my opinion is what it is
in this memoir author creates a very specific mood that is the same throughout the memoir
laughing is healthy and good for the heart
being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies
when we woke up we were there
the computers that people think of are machines that sit in a room and is used often but not for its purpose
my <caps> came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because i was not talking to her
my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills
i was really happy for myself and i even told the girl good shot
they can either play sports or even take a walk or run
a lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends
<person> looked at <caps> and simply said yes
<caps> wants to go on the computer that day and throws a ten turn the parent should take the computer away for the next and so on and so on
even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world
everyone uses them or has used them before
they struggled both personally and financially
it would also be taking away the artists or authors freedom of speech and expression
the building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation
the setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat
those are what i think are his moods and the reason for them
i will always remember that day as one of the craziest days of my life
there was a time i was very patient
<caps> is of buddy my <caps> screeched as she ran down the stairs
a production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them
i sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me
that is the major problem the builders had
the library is not just for the children but also for the adults
computers are useful to find information for school projects
slow i walked slow i talked slow
most people when on the computer tend to eat more <caps> are all wellknown facts
i was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was
many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state
i glanced at my watch almost every <num> second
it shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy
but everyone on <location> should be patient
or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones
his memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it
which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea
it would be very dry and dull
but it does so we must censor certain things that people <month> get a offended by if they saw it in there public library
thats not how you should spend your life
we had been patient enough on the plane ride to <organization>
learn to stand proud on what you believe
this method is widely used today in the modern world
a problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind
you could smell the tension in the air as everyone watched the clock spin on the last <organization> of school
my face was beet red
that know matter what i do i cant make it go away and the computer ends up being broken
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made
so thats a good thing
the hostages of the computer cant even sped time with their families
their going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though
it took the entire time and i am still not done with it
it is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyones goal should be
i was patient then because i had to wait until she was born and then i could become a big sister
it is their job to just offer information
about a hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while i was staying there
another problem they encountered was the dirigibles were unsafe
it was very hard to be patient but i tried my best
for example when she broke down in the flower shop
i knew that he was a good wrestler even though i had about <num> pounds on him
these boxes can be harmful to their users eyes
it was however not enough
he looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch
my family also believes that at my age right now i should not watch rated <caps> movies
not everyone likes the same things
<percent> out of <num> people said they like typing on the computer more then writing it on <caps>
another way is go on a website where you can penpal someone from a different place in the world
<caps> bleeding by the highway at the corner as the fence <person> with him
if you are not patient things will only get worse
theres many people out their like me
we really have fun together
for example <person> would do anything for his family
the first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there
that is very dangerous because your cholesterol will rise
we were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had
based on this excerpt the builders faced a few problems when building the empire state building
have them grow up the way they want to grow up
get up and prevent the negative effects of computers
there are so many books the can be a little offensive to people and even kids
the faith the struggle hard times
she was bringing up good memories of her past life in her home
thats what i was told as a child
so people can see what the author has to say
and to this day is not open for the public to use
some ways computers are good for you are that you can get a better education when you have websites with so much information
this problem is something he would like to keep to himself
soon the sun starts to beat on him even more
at most jobs you have to know how to work a computer
this gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through
the girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant
i remember this one time when i had to write a final draft for an important essay and it was <caps> last day to do it
the heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst
it is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses
i stared up ahead to see <caps> bright blue sled reaching the finish line
at the time there were also <caps> forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low
so we played <num> <caps> to pass the time
exercise is a main way of staying healthy
people will always read no matter what
friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you
the last problem was the law stating airships can <caps> that low above urban cities
mom told <person> and i to go to bed
there are many great things about computers
i think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child
the cyclist is very hot
when the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride
why get rid of books that others <month> read
people would start to cut down on the amount of time they spend on their computers and start to live
the second example is parents should protest so books or other etc things could be rid of
at home you need patience
we did recycling everyday
the fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later
after the first couple minutes of class i had found that the rumors were true
my own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for <num> hours straight
another example is when ever i watch <caps>
the cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town
it was said in paragraph <num> that dirigibles did try to reach the building
the greatest obstacle was the wind
they where also lucky that they where going to have a better life
if something were to happen and the dirigible was to catch fire
thats why i think there should be a certain section where only a certain amount of ages are allowed to go
also there was one boy
one obstacle the builders faced was the harsh winds
this problem was discovered when the u
it gives them to learn handeye
all the time i was just in his arms
he also made the kids parents seem like very nice people which set a friendly mood
dear <caps> i think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it
people should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience
i was patient by waiting for my mom to take me
i know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games
when on the computer there is no enjoying the outdoors
i actually liked making a new friend this way
if you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it
our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire
nature was one of many major problems to allow a dirigible to dock
computers have gotten more advanced over time
the problem is there are millions of children like <location> who are not getting enough exercise instead opting
<person> wrote a famous book called <organization>
<caps> means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song
theres tons of loving people around the house too
the line was to long so we decided to go on some other rides
last <date> i went to <caps> <caps>
laughing has always changed <caps> mood and helped me through situations
this is very convenient
safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the empire state building
many kids would rather choose the computer programming class rather than physical education
we are better than that and our literature shows it
<caps> was about half way into my <date> when my mom had told me the <caps> news
my friend <person> is very patience person
for example two blimps attempted the docking and one of them could not come close to the building because of winds
one of the greatest electronics invented
i had never seen him be first chair on anything
a sport or hanging out
i thought it was an alright idea
the setting is active just like the cyclist
<caps> he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir
those are the ways that the author created a happy mood in the memoir
we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while <caps> was all muddy
i really missed <location> where i had friends i can understand and laugh together
docking a dirigible to the building would put stress on the buildings frame
she failed the <num> grade
you slept for long was though him might sleep until school that back up
<caps> can only learn so much from a world history textbook
and that half of what he says is basically a joke
as you can see this is why i believe it is positive
so in the other words the computer is useful for students
just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book
with this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework
please heed the following advice
at first it wont be easy but its worth it in the long run
the congregation of family and friends
many girls have gotten taken because of this
shes one of <caps> closest friends
if your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day <caps> one week can <caps> your vision from a <num> <num> to <num> <num>
getting rid of a material can lose someone information about whatever they are researching
winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents
i pick the movie i wanted to see
everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive
i feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer
in my life there has been many times were i have been patient and times when have hot been patient
a time of be patience when is all the time if you was not patience you will run all time
so i just played my <caps>
on the right hand side because we can get off on get back on the high way
once on <date> break my family and i went to <location>
com and all the other search engines
these winds would make the back of the dirigible swivel around and around the mooring mast
when the dock was in place at the top of the empire state building two dirigibles tried landing but both times it was a failure
i think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children
one such feature is the hills that are present in the essay
i helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience
hydrogen is highly flammable
the dentists decided to treat him first
i said it was fun i made people laugh
surely the pressure to build the tallest tower in the world got to them
it just goes to show no ones opinion is right or wrong
right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of <caps>
today is a first day of <caps> first new middle school
laughter will always bring people to relationships
they get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities
above all the author clearly shows his love for his parents
the library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic
laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy
what was so darn funny
we walk down are drive way an thats where the walk starts
offensive articles and or movies and magazines etc should not be pulled from shelves
they can find out what the weather is like so they know how to puck when going places
libraries should just stick to the same old same old a section for kids with kid books
a library is a place to sit and enjoy the surroundings
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
its also a great way to keep in touch with long distance family or friends
the mood created by the author was great
my friend went a few days before and said it was a good <organization>
computers are very important and are life changing
i noticed a picture on the front of <caps> binder that someone had drawn
those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad
<person> and i look back to see if <person> was behind us and no he was not
if they limit their time on the computer and do some active game it would be better for the child
the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
with a cellphone you have to buy the phone and pay the bill every month
those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
one feature included the first ghost town that he come by
they hit the ball and it started to come toward me and i went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt
a <caps> showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat <caps> its faster and the two people can see each other
in <caps> opinion i think computers have negative effects on people
the last type of game is the tower defense
the computer is like a addiction
it would teach us to be more intelligent
<person> and i would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone
this book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the <location> during the earlier years of the <location>
you just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home
laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them
the boy obviously thought i was talking about joints
its up too the parents too show their <caps> what too read and what not too read
when communicating with people on the computer the writer tends to short hand things
<caps> an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas
this quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test
laughing is truly the key to living a great life
her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret
there were already hundreds of trees that had come uprooted there were bound to be more
the speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a heatstroke which could slow him down
also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends
a fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus
or the big dragon came from <location>
so if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it
if he gos too pot he could spin out of commission and the water was trouble
a final obstacle was an already existing law
were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
they are renewed in a symbolic sense
soon as the temperature rises to what feels like two hundred degrees the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels sometimes life can feel so cruel
this <date> <person> and i will be returning to <location> <person> and are looking forward to many new memories and laughs that we will share
the hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again
they will be curious
then he was done and the time was about <num> <caps> at night by now
your bank account number
the same with magazines
it also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends
it showed her getting used to her environment
too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him
so then there would be no books left
day <num> i had about <num> bottles of water but my sister was still hanging in there
so reader these are some reasons why people should easily computers
one can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language
now thats a good game
sixteen minutes go by and still nothing
i believe that <caps> is one of the most important part of any relationship
this rapid spread of the news saved many lives in <location> as people immediately dropped what they were doing and rushed to help
so people think that compute is fun for them
as time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious
fifteenth minutes later i arrived at my moms house
in addition to all this some people can task and many things like hang out with there family and friend but most importantly enjoy life
it prohibited the flying of any air travel bellow a certain feet in residential areas
by the end of the first sentence everyone was giggling
after that we went back onto the trails and skipped through the trees
i still do not see why it is such a big deal of reading uncensored material
the last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas
my mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or i
all the adult magazines should be with the adult reading books
get into a fun conversation or debate
its not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material
many want to protect their youth from some of the so called harmful things in society
computers not only give us knowledge but they give over half us catch the members of society that do wrong
i asked ten adults if they think everyone should have to a computer and ten out of ten said yes
on another note a survey shows that <percent> of children that spend time with there family and less than <num> minutes on the computer have grades higher than <num> in all classes
this law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building
so me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie
the biggest company <month> need an computer even the <organization> need them they are big in you company
so read on to hear more
this way she found a fun place and left the country for week
i disagree that media materials should be taken of shelves for being offensive
our imaginations were bouncing off the walls
the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there
every day my fourth grade teacher would give us math home work that was really long and hard
also in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again and this will give her newfound strength that will cause her to pass
especially with my dad
finally it was <person> turn
i immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie
there were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong
my brother was very excited to here her plan
instead of being on the computer learning hand eye
it is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech
the idea of the mooring mast was a very under thought idea
i do not think that there should be censorship in libraries
that game improves your counting of numbers
the dream for the empire state building was to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of it
<percent> of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college
i had asked my mom and my dad if i could get it
if your always happy on the computer
it turned out to be a okay day after all of what happened
here is evidence from the article
she said <caps> go ahead so i went over sat next to some girls and talked to them
laughter is an important element to have in life
i remember when a lady came to our school who was blind and deaf and she demonstrated how to use that special program
to help us catch criminals
they cant take every bad or vulgar thing off of the shelves
my mom had to go to where she works because she forgot something
some of those people <month> have certain religions that say they cant read or listen to certain things
most of these offensive items are not placed in libraries because of this problem with people being offended
i knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes
libraries contain many helpful and entertaining materials for people of all ages
every time i glanced in her direction it became even more funny
censorship in libraries
i could tell that <caps> was very excited
so we waited and the line went really fast
overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy
the last example was that he grateful for his parents sacrifice and love
so finally they called me in and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight
she will either tell us to knock it off or she will make us run a couple laps around the gym
wake up call rolled around at about four in the <time> for us two girls in a nonsound proof tent
<caps> went and found a long stick outside in the snow
finally a duelist named <caps>
not one please or thank you were said as we walked away
some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer
our reply was pure laughter
nobody should go through life without laughter
<caps> be so vulnerable anyone could get in and cause pain
it was fun trying to get to class because i slid around everywhere
kids like me that normally have a long rough day at school like to come home and rest with some nice game on the computer
music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people
communication has evolved so much in the past <num> years
its an amazing thing when people laugh
we needed it to thrive
the one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law
this is a big part of teenager life
computers are an outrage
just make sure that you know what your kid reads
<num> out <organization> <num> computers are used for learning about place and people
my other friend <person> spent the <time> at <person> house the <time> his mom died
this is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope
hardly anyone will read them anyway
there was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel
it is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the empire state building
i was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient
the features of the setting effected the cyclist very much
one reason is that you can explore things at home
i got better because laughter is the best medicine
that is what matters
my friends and i can get along in different ways not just in laughter
that their parents swear up and down you cannot understand
<person> finally got the strength to get up
computers have a large positive effect on our lifestyle
the whole night we hung out and danced like crazy
and whether you realize it or not laughter helps you to
the author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change
by describing the hills as rolling it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through
its really funny if you the one playing it but if your listening to it
the more people get computers the people exercise
in movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention
censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish
if i had found something that i disagreed with i would not read it or just think nothing of it
in this quote i felt the mood which was love and the <caps> inquires it with his word choice
i just cant wait for class to be over most of the time
they were all excited and everything
so my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit
on the computer you can chat and talk with people without having to be on the phone and paying a bill for it
i know a thirteen year old named <organization>
nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games
it was two and a half hours before he got their
according to the passage this law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
<person> talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood with many other immigrants
com and millions of people will see it
<caps> for me gets me motivated for the day its like my drug to get through life
reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like
from this you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement
the different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all
i remember having some difficulties with a few friends and one of my cousins gave me very good advice through an instant messaging program named <caps>
thats just like smoking
the articles would probably be <num> after the events occur
<caps> first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it
it in an ideal way to relax after a stressful way getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs
approximately three months ago my family and i decided to take a trip to <location>
he was running out of water in the desert
its not laughter that kills people
i was doing a waterdepleting 12 mph
its just a dam book let us read them
the end result is usually us both with tear streaked faces from laughing so hard
then he goes to <num> hour science and there is a lab with partners
back in but then it was half time
seventh class of the day
certainly it cant be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go
again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him
also she likes the geese and the hibiscus and these things might make her feel more comfortable
if there ever was a need to really look at something and give <caps> another chance this would be the topic right here
censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well
thats why he could be a highest level of the company
the mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic
<person> explained the situation further as we intently listened to the sickening words coming out of his mouth
the expectation for dirigibles to dock on the empire state building was very high
<caps> lets get it over with
<person> shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as <caps> could at <organization> face
those are my reasons why the effects computers have on people are not good
but that was the exact opposite of <caps> was going on right now
everyone gets in position
the censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree
another <caps> is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type
which meant it would have taken along time just land and fueling
we took a bas it took seven <caps>
family always makes everything special
<caps> i borrowed it and got that eighty five bucks
laughing really can open someones eyes
that is the mood i think the author is trying to set
<caps> try not to let <caps> happen again <caps> said
laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny
in this memoir gives a grateful feeling
so they can live in a house
you can not removed that
there are plenty of dangers out there in <location>
usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age <caps> and up
i hope you have a positive way on computers they help you out
the mood in the memoir was very warm and happy
i was living out in <location> and it gets pretty hot in the <date>
our couch had to call someone to bring us another set of keys
they are apart of our history and the history were creating
due to violent winds at the elevation these weights would waver the blimp and its weights
such as there was a law preventing airships to fly too low over urban areas
she plants it when she gets home and vows to take a driving test again
they help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home
the implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends
<caps> how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family
the second problem is the cyclist lack of water
in this case computers are good
the workers were exhausted
i also have to wait for my bust
the people of the world always have a priority
this form of technology is called the computer
for most of my childhood i did this and it was very simple
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
i got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in
this brought on thoughts about it happening at the empire state building
everything about his family gave me a warm sunny feeling
<caps> mom said with a smile
computer have a very positive effect on us
have some fan in the sun today
simple house into a home
for example you can play games
<caps> is going to kill you
censorship is illegal where we live
the little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed
laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose
its not the computers fault
there is a water ride where you get in a log then you sit and it takes you up a hill
fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author
i can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that i enjoyed our trip
building the empire state building was no easy task
i knew that to get fudge i had to be patient
once <caps> i was <num> years old i had a and <caps>
<caps> replied with a really confused face walking out of the room
one time i had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to <location> it was not fun
its not like parents can keep us away from it forever
simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens
then you never know what there parents wanted them to know at a young age like that
this is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever
<caps> is required to clap
computers are really great sources for whatever you trying to do
everyone has a different view on things
the <organization> spire was originally built to be more than just visibly stimulating
another problem they ran into was the law
you cant keep getting mad at them for making fun of me
when i first moved here i was a very shy person
he setting of this short story affects the cyclist
know you know that i think that computers need to be seen less throughout the human day
adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries reading materials
the mood created in this memoir is friendship
the three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough
the cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water
music could also be a bad influence on kids
winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents
so if they would just take those things off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problems at the libraries
i was a flock of seagulls haircut
so that <caps> at school <caps> remembered her moms words and was very patient all <caps>
you cant focus on the people around you
when he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad
however you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years
laughter plays a big roll in my life
there are bad books but there are also good books in the library
like he said in the memoir i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home
when i was about six my family and i went to my cousins ranch in <organization>
one of these obstacles was that it was unsafe
libraries are meant to provide information to people so i think thats all that they should have
there are also lot of different in what people want
he just made everyone happier to his laugh
throughout the process of building the empire state building with dirigibles dock there were many complications
this method would not be safe if used on the empire state building
after a while <person> and <person> got tired
patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action
if a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life
that year and two months has been the greatest period of my life
the cat gets its goal by being patient
one time was the often best friend i had went to a ride it was so hot outside but the first ride we on was called the <caps>
but overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries
the last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use
some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other
the whole idea was dangerous and risky
one way is to keep in contact
however it is also very foul
it would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to <caps>
libraries are open to people of all age
people have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting
hes grateful to how much his parents did so much for him and others
i honestly never seen someone on the computer for
i could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself
most dirigibles from outside of the united states use hydrogen rather than helium
one major problem was that they used hydrogen which is highly flammable and they were in a highly populated area
with a click of a button you should be going to <caps> or a nice vacation
in the short story of the mooring mast
i was in the car with my mom and <num> sister
finally my <caps> day of high school was coming up
<caps> i am usual stressed out the one thing i love is to hangout with my friends
the last one is when i was <num>
some of the most interesting books that i have ever read are offensive in some way
these types of things are very offensive to people
lack was not a factor in this story
these two factors will cause major stress in you daily life
it was here where i learned the real definition of family
this saves the lives of many people
it was just as boring riding a bike around town and stopping inside the shop <caps> make small talk just as sitting by the fire in <num> degree weather
its a great way to see and learn about different places compared to how you live
all of these things should be
this would be bad for the people on the street
also when i was supper hungry i sat there and did not complain
including the importance of one
i was so grossed out i basically threw myself at the sink
so when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth
well thats what i got for using the <caps> for knowledge
in conclusion <caps> was very proud and thankful to his parents
we had o walk all the way across the school to get them
having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good
this is the case for many other people too
computers are a great way to use in communication
to them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other
this reminds me of my friend named <caps>
instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer
i learned in class that in the job were much more difficult than they are today because of technology
then ran down stairs and shared them with her mother rocking in her chain
one reason why the mooring mast could not dock these is because places outside of the u
rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills
some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music
the advantage in technology has provided many new ways for <caps> family and i to communicate with each other
another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast
it is a key item when someone is looking to travel
the bible is considered to be one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print
there were many obstacles that stood in the way of the of allowing dirigibles to dock there
now this law made it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building
dear <person> i think myself that the computers could help u
growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
quite sometime l can be patient and cant be patient
the mood of the author in the memoir are grateful and thankful
the rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were
this creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them
once again i headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river
it is better to go outside you got fresh air its nice and cold
he starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men
the mood the author created in the memoir is
we waited three hours in that room
the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus
others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read
<caps> is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their <caps> <caps>
these are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives
but i would have to say that most people live off of or get entirely influenced by what they read or hear
lastly in a computer you <caps> basically find out anything you want to know
there are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries
please continue on to learn about how we should use the computer
it is funny how even hearing someones laugh can give you feelings for them
there were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the empire state building
i personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent
this paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging
then i waved my arms around to make him stop
i remember in <num> grade when i had a math midterm
things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others so keep everything on the shelves
unfortunately this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans
finally another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building was because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas
if i found something that was offensive to me i would just ignore it
finally the ride was up and running but <caps> took another half hour for testing and when that ended <caps> was a two hour wait in the back
i said yeah that is true
they were just writing a book
you can learn about faraway places
this is way computers can be a bad thing
that is where it <caps> <caps> <caps>
kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it
if you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful
having friends so close by you can really make every life great
something that they want to express by telling raping
he told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game
the last point i will be touching on this discussion is the loss of money that some of the schools have due to damaged books and stolen property
one obstacle was nature
thats why this is a free country
its all based on how you take what they said into thought
the most challenging problem faced by the author was the lack of water
it was happier because we know that he could have more life opportunities in <location>
once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left
computers are a magnificent tool for new things
the building would have to be modified and strengthened before the dirigibles could go there
computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future
<caps> smiles and reaches down to help me up
in the end of it all a book is just a book
so after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick
<person> is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood
on the cover of many magazines women as well as men bodies are exposed
the last thing which makes everyone change is what computers can do now
he needs something because there was another town <num> miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going
he was running as fast as he could and i yelled at him to stop and wait <caps> he kept coming
new programs such as <organization> word have a special function called voice commands
i looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen
of course not all users have a computer for information
i was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade
i told him i sometimes say i would rather live in <location> than where i live know because <caps> so much calmer there
they made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building
for example <percent> of people will stay on the computer all day and wont even worry about their kids
teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story
this has been a joy to write i hope you think so to
war books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be
not just because he is my dad
it is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing
in order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all
<caps> walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help and she replied if you could i live over <caps> she pointed to a large tan house
their was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at <time>
went to go buy everything and it was like the next day was my <num> birthday
a quote that shows this is the demonstration of how important family and friends are
surging winds would not allow the airship to maintain its course and the ship would be blown erratically around the mast
after the ride i asked my cousin why she was so silent
all <organization> these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising
but when it was <num> seconds left and we where down by <num> point i got fouled
yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one
the were all so lead weights to lower the dirigibles down but this could also set risk for people said on page <num>
something that you have to live out for yourself
thats what people want is to see people for who they are
we still have to wait a little bit longer in the if we go back
i said a little then <organization> got <caps> on my bed and started bouncing
recently over the <date> of <date> i was fortunate enough to meet my uncle whom i have never consciously met
a bad sign of patience <caps> when you brake down the door and you have to pay for <caps>
the way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him
well libraries contain more then just books
in paragraph <num> the author states the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
that is the end of my story
the wind was so strong that it could throw it into a building
they know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author
the terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water
he used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day
i love computers and everybody else should too
that was the day when we had to take a writing part
music is a whole story its self
he also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen
<caps> we both calmed down we went our separate ways
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
that was the time when i was patient for six hours in the <caps>
lastly it can even increase you chances of finding a job or helping out your job
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness
<caps> were the last people
not everything can be just peachy kin all the time
computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school
not that people have patience
that is why i think the author wrote that as the last paragraph
i feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material
computer even have a positive effect on people across the world
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
<caps> even the elegant music could mask the crowds uproar
what is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper <month> include information that is not suitable for all groups of people
<caps> asked <caps> i showed it to her
this is the only time when i was patient
the mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be i believe love
people laugh at their own mistakes which show others that they too make mistakes
i think they are a great addition to society though
so take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it
it is a beautiful sunny day <caps> <date>
thats why they should have <caps> computers because it takes the attention
one after school i was walking home with my friends from school
having an oneonone talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books
i hope i persuaded you to like computers more
it is because there are people who do like it and do not have a problem at all and like me is not bothered by it what so ever
movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart
slowly advancing t words use
censorship should not even exist
this can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way
i would think that computers give a positive effect on people
the builders of the empire state building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
for example one big problem they faced was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
i was very patient to hear who won the <caps> <caps> contest
<caps> a while she found out that she was a dollar short
books are an extremely important part of literature
another way this mood of happiness is portrayed is through his writing about people coming together
when your on your computer for several hours you tend to got sucked in and not interact with anyone
its one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but its not whenever you do it for the fun of it
they bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell
the author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it
when you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource
about ten minutes later i get a text saying meet me outside to walk around
other obstacles were made for the builders of the empire state building which proves that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles
the right one so i was very happy
our national parks <num> have been decreasing in their numbers of customers at a fast rate
the final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law
<caps> stopped and looked around
all in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
the features of the setting made the cyclists journey even longer and more strenuous
with censorship nobody will feel left out and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same
the biggest problem was safety
no one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot <date> day while emailing a friend
all of these reasons are why the mooring dock never came to life on top of the empire state building
i think computers are a great way to have fun
typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs
having great coordination would mean that person would exceed past anybody who do not use computers
people are not leaving their house and not getting active
the most thing that matters in his life are family
the mood the author created in the memoir is a roller coaster
this is why i think that the censorship can be good and bad
one other reason was it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
this illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past
so do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
we arrived at the house <time>
there was all so an existing law against these air ships
people are becoming addicted to computers
but after all of those people that can and cant people cant quit
it made it very difficult for him to finish his ride
if a child is doing a report about a country in <location> they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country
through these our settings the effects change
he tells them of his
you can use <caps> to find people you need to find
at that time i really began to feel like <caps> were my family
the aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost nonexistent had the idea been carried out
this would make it illegal for the ships to even approach the area
the idea of the building for acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped
the ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey
by the time the skit was over i was rolling on the floor laughing
where <caps> could see to the other side of the river and there were other people camping on the other side
a fresh start with the drivers test
also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out
<caps> <caps> this is <person> she said with a smile
most importantly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
likewise there are other times that close family or friends can talk to each other over the <caps>
one of the problems was violent air currents
this could puncture the dirigibles material and cause a horrifying accident
the way the author explains everything puts you in the same mood is him
in that situation i would just go on <caps> computer and <caps> a friend asking them for the assignment
i did everything i had so much fun it was like heaven at my house
so my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things
another problem they faced was the law
my mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time
this creates an atmosphere of passion
having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is
they get sucked in stressed out and stalked
i think the mood that was expressed the most was happiness
when asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest
she came over at around noon and we played for hours
it is used to show a spirit in the girl
perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation
i made some more food and went to sleep
i hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn
the solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books
maybe just for a little awhile <caps> its still something that could make your whole day better
so you got my opinion on censorship and i hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer
money can also contribute to the addiction
laughter is a important part of life
the mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety
they make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus
when i first started my relationship with <person> all i could think about was being able to enjoy the times that i have with her
some kids might not even read any more because you took the best books out of the library
the dirigibles were mostly filled with highly flammable hydrogen
i think that at least <percent> of people would try this
because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast
i asked a boy who was in few other of my classes
in the selection do not exceed posted speed limit there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist
to this day i will never forget that moment
many parents have different standards and what some parents find acceptable for their children <month> appall others
<caps> those insignificant moments in life when were reminded of who we are and the bonds we share
you should buy a computer today
i said sounding a little sarcastic and hoping to start a conversation
at the hotel the boys got the top story while the girls got the lower story near the swimming pool
this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
there will always be many more books there to look at
its part of life we must cherish every moment we can
just <date> we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our <organization>
she was obtaining a plethora of <caps> on most of her tests after not studying because she was on for almost six hours everyday
without computers i never would have learned so much about that place
being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard
people might come in the library looking for a book that they want
those are a few ways to describe how the <caps> created this happy and loving mood
laughter can always keep you out of fights no matter what
the censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust
for example when i go to get my allergy shots i have to be patient
i decided to take a chance and peek over my back pack to see who the teacher was looking at for her next victim
after lunch i had <caps>
i cant say it nicely
i garbed for one and jumped on right before <person> could stop me
president <person> even says the computer is where <percent> of the world gets info
they are also a great way to learn
i snapped and started to complain
they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as <organization>
if you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store
this decision is now up to you
it was very nice to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us get through
this effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off
so my dad hands him the keys and says keep it on <num> wheels
i came out of the house after counting to <num>
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
he came home three hours later
most of the time a child will read what looks interesting and fun
ultimately consumes all free time
<caps> as simple as that
well computers can be a good or a bad thing
they should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things
video games make you think that is also reason they are good
the cashier said hi <month> i take your <caps>
thats the story when i had to be patient
you have read my reasons and you have realized what the computer does for the world
some other guys shot one they all run way
nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child
it is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test
but he keeps saying that <caps> are proof of aliens
this is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue
the ability us to get more education
so please keep reading my letter and i will tell you the side effects of the computer
the mood created by the author memoir is
many people believe computers are good for nothing
i also find it faster to type then print
not only did he practice baseball but also typing
the mood created my the author was happy
like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long
taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it
<caps> got it i said
taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers
computers affect people in a positive way
stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come
it seems that people are getting fatter every day
people have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong
she is saying that she wants to start over
the music industry try their best to sort the music to your taste
a lot of <caps> <caps> might get offended by all the racial slurs about <caps> <caps>
the author is very happy his parents did this for him
countless extended family members came and wentand there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet
after the pushed the quad off of me i was laying there for like <num> minutes laughing in pain for some reason that i cant remember
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
the computer being addicting leads to getting enough exercise
the first thing i had to <caps> was to start the truck because mom turned it off before she got out
it is never right to tell people what they can or can not know
we got in line behind maybe <num> people or more
as i mentioned before the computer is beneficial to our education
thats not a good thing
another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go hometohome to make sure the procedure is being done
no one is forcing them to look at it or use it
<caps> is the drug that descends from the heavens
firstly it allows them to type
when you exercise you have tons of energy to <caps> anything
as soon as you read that you now something is wrong
this is why the hibiscus is so important to the story
when i was ten years old my mom promised me a phone
i know i would like to
questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises
the author created a loving and accepting mood in the memoir
i believe in each and everyone of our lives we all have a special moment we desire to worship forever
both attempts were failures and it became clear that the empire state building would not be able to serve as a dirigible landing
books can be a way of learning how to deal with thing in a better way
books are most commonly used in the library
people that spend to much time on the computer do not have time to interact with family or friends
this will be used through out people lives
some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music
the answer is probably no
the cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all
this sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident
in paragraph <num> it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger
i was ready to walk down to the beach but <person> said she wanted to go <caps> right on the docks
books are important to have
censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea
having a computer would be very bad for your physical lifestyle
anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays
laughter means a lot in a relationship in <caps> opinion
computers are one of the best technology we have <date>
you have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for
at the end my <caps> ended up with his suit
during his first couple seasons <person> stayed calm and on to win five more championships
the mood the author created in the memoir was happiness and satisfaction
you might say that it is good for me but it is not good for you
censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be
he would take my bike like if <caps> was his
so that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell
i said when we were boarding the plane
for example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot
computers greatly help families of today
so these one some of the main reasons why i say that the computer is not always a good because people spend a much time on them
king and that was the day i had to be patient
the <caps> of <organization> by <person> is a classic example of a censored book
new technology greater than my knowledge is coming
if the child dose not return the book in that amount of time they should charge them for every day it is late
it was like something you only dream about
the new technology makes life easier to handle
in the end laughing was what we needed to do we had come this far that we could either give up or push and succeed
computers are changing the way everyday people live
we also got him some <person>
you pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own
my om named off a couple things that needed to be done around the house
<person> grunted as <caps> tossed the sack over his shoulder
come on really they have animals in movies that talk all the time
the owners of the empire state building believed that if something went wrong then the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street
my friends mom was nice enough to come pick us up
everyone was eager to get it
people should maintain a right to choose which books he or she <month> want to read
the simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone
sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies
because it give me and my friends something to do after school
i also think that the materials on that shelf is allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot no matter what
so they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be <num> or older to enter and a identification card to prove it
the walk was about three to four miles long
while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building the builders faced many obstacles
as soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter
there is also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
i if the world did not have computers we would not have cell phones or even t
refer the <num> word war
you need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature
more people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise
a second issue builders faced was mother nature herself
even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe
i was eating a sandwich and my grandpa was jacking around and catching fish
well <caps> not this article gives you information about all of this
where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect
<caps> would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in
without it you cant get picture off <organization> or type an essay that due
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there
i am very fortunate for having a computer that can help with not only school work but my social life and how i make friends
thank you for listening
someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt
back in <date> only <percent> of the <caps> population was obese
i think that books should not be pulled from the self because they have a few bad words in them
some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money
this makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home
for me laughter helps us in many ways
the sunny hot weather will affect his will to ride
all four of us sat down at the dinner table and ate
computers make this a whole lot easier on us
i have several reasons i feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some
another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather
i agree we should spend more time outside but we should also spend some time inside
this would be useful for a school project on a country
he also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go
my third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them factories would crash
another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat
censorship should come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
relationships are usually better if both the people are happy
we did all sorts of things together
the next day i passed my test
now i hear my favorite <caps> tunes
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
this sent us into a panic more that anything
like if it has to deal with sex or violence they should be taken off shelves
that way i can learn and see characters adventures through my own eyes
the lack of water he has does not help
like other things we got tired of <caps> and went our separate ways for free time
if you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer
people have told her that she should become a comedian
the heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water
two <caps> who were making notes on how how our conversation is going decided to help us
i think that censorship should be allowed in high school
the second example that the mood created by the author in memoir also was being happy about his life
seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will giver herself and newfound integrity to go try that driving test again
this means all media of any kind should be destroyed
i mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area
lastly computers help people make money and support their family
her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed
<caps> is most thankful of his parents
also people people have the right to choose what they want
in my life time i have been to many libraries
and the libraries letting kids read them without an i
these are also the reasons why the architects of the empire state building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct
i was very patient that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes
the last obstacle was the lack of landing area for these enormous balloons
because i really wanted to buy something
if i knew a book would be offensive to me i would never pick it up
on average it takes <num> seconds to find information
all of the sudden i look over and <organization> is puking all over on the ground
when it got dark out i saw something
you can find info about there future person they can look up there
another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother
the potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face
it is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on
without these sites there might be less divorces and more happy ending fairy tales
censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a humans thoughts
we woke up after only sleeping two hours the night before because we were up all night messing around having a <caps> time
sorry be on time next time
the kind of laugh that you remember
that is where the computer can help
you have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age
computers are the best way to research a topic
they help us contact distant family members
thats the time i was patient at the dentist office
not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings
<caps> middle school student
finally it was <date>
another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down
the public <caps> is open for anybody to read a book
even though she has failed her drivers test
<caps> dad found out about <caps> and he decided to try it out
that is why will need technology
i believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad
you can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer
my mom and i were at my aunts house trying desperately not too laugh
in the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening
and these teachings have been the basis of my life
all in all we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom
they can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime
these materials do not have to be removed completely
censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for
thats the world we we live in
i left with my family and thought about that girl
all of these obstacles proved to be too much for the workers to handle as the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was never created
a lot of peoples time
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
as i waited patiently until all of <caps> old relatives opened their presents it was finally <caps> turn
my strong hatred for the world was begin to handicap me in various if not most important aspect
one day my family and i all went to <caps> point
then if the library close down the people who come there often wont have no place to study or work or nothing
many people have issues with their race or nationality being messed with
that means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be
<location> parents told us to go do something outside
they will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day
the last thing that is subjected to rather extreme censorship is books
then after he says that it ways he chuckled
computer help you out with projects and i think everyone should have one too
my last reason is the <caps>
laughter is truly an essential part of life
computer are also great because you can video chat with friends and family
arguing in my family causes friction to the point where we become unsocial and turn to a computer
some people are and some are and some are not
the same idea can go with any topic in the world today
it was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us
they need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to
it makes <caps> feel way better in the end
the obstacles the builder of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were a lot
but these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends
they drive about <num> miles to the <caps> stadium
the orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her
but i was still nervous
many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who i was able to connect with through laughter
then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library
as we laid there he stuck his hand into my pants
one of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire
in my opinion people would be better off without them
that includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them
the average people can learn about non average things any day
one day i had an <caps> to go to the carnival
removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it
they can do anything
<caps> i decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available
<caps> looked at me <caps> stopped
he goes back down and watches cartoons
putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content
the computer today is such a great thing to have in your house
maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad
<caps> had a genuine personality no other dog could possess
<caps> and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great
i gave <person> a quick smile and told her that <caps> and i would turn around and talk with her
the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage
my laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door
there is this field with extremely tall grass and we were walking right next to it
my point of view on this topic is simple
you really are <caps> and i also have <caps> jokes about me and i really do not mind <caps> people tell <caps> jokes to me
this would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy
i believe that this is definitely true because i remember that the same happened to my sister
computers are helpful piece of technology and one of the best
i had grabbed all of my gear from the storage from under the bus <person> headed for the slopes
where we were going next was still undecided
i jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen
for an hour and a half i had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent
<caps> said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question
music is used for so many different things
but mainly the mood is loving
all the old people i know hate all the rap
and with one more door to open thats at the beginning of the hallway where every one is sitting or standing
after she failed the test she bought the flower
if the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution
we were going to <caps>
<caps> a very curious <caps>
his team <caps> the game
not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines
i think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries
the third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment
now you can use this technology as a tool not a game
there are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things
<caps> of these ideas for not using the computer is very easy
computers help with this goal
the line was like <num> to <num> people in the line
i know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others
i know this from personal experience
a lot of business transactions and presentations are done out on a computer for maximum efficiency
well they can talk and see each other while on video chat and it will feel like still here
one obstacle that the builders had to face was when they were building the mooring mast to hold the dirigibles
i chose to write a story in my own way about patients
we had been planning this camping trip for the <date> few weeks
when <caps> boarded the plane and found our seats my <caps> said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience
this will make you a lot more friends
somehow we are lost all over again so we find another covenant store up this really big hill
the fact that they put these things in a library shocks me greatly
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there
this can help keep families in touch
in conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist
this ride was the biggest one of all time
this is a story about a time i was patient
the last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road
i waited and ate break fast and then went fishing
everything was fine until the car broke down on the free way
computers are used for getting messages to different people in the
everyone has their own meaning of offensive
i think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship
you can just use <organization> and you type your essay
and i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
at that elevation the was constantly shifting
some of my friends think that <caps> is an offensive novel but i found the book to be rather enjoyable
it is a privilege that if taken away would tear <caps> a part
without books there would be no real sort of entertainment
a good half an hour later <caps> dad comes through the door with <person> close behind
also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment
we were nearing the end of our trip and we had <caps> only one more big drop still left to conquer
this is a very good thing
the victim will get tired of being teased or talked about
they would rather go on the computer
they can also help people get a better education
there was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle
<caps> and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked
so computers are unhealthy for people to have
these are just some of the many ways computers are helpful
the mood created in the memoir is grateful
the final obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
i believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases
we sat there being quiet
then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road
one day my mom and i went to the eye doctor
another great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
i think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms
your computer will come up with hundreds of different ways to make a <caps> chicken for dinner
<caps> guess is terrible
the plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant
its altering a authors work
<caps> they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff
they would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves
without computers a negative affect people
this caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired
this can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop
blocked the pavement in front of me
the law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas
he said that was one house hold he would never forget
that was the time i was patient the most ant longest
i turned even to see the stud coming down
with all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures
the mood the <caps> creates is happy
she vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flowers survival and her realization of important memories
and thats all there is to <caps>
their child might even have the right to it
when i got older i started doing stand up comedy
adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers
<percent> of our children play video games
for a school project in <caps> i had to research about <location>
to talk to our friends or even to talk to other people in the world
computers almost makes anything possible
advances in technology improve society and the over all way of life around the globe
he is also happy his parents kept their homes open to everybody
the <caps> had many mood in the memoir
these are some obstacles builders have to face
theres always something you can do when you go on a computer
faced many obstacles in its construction which questioned its safety and prevented it from being practical
censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools
libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs
this shows that he appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills
the tips of my fingers bounced of the arm rest with every one movement
i get to keep in touch with my family and friends i no longer see
i was patient when i went to the doctors
yes i do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf
this moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check
other problems where nature and law
i believe that books were made for a purpose
<caps> censorship should be applied to libraries
the builders faced many obstacles by attempting to allow blimps to dock at the empire state building
think about the <caps> situation that you might come across and can be offensive to you
we both begin to laugh as we run over to his car
especially on the <time> of <caps> <caps>
<caps> that i have met them i am able to stay them through the computer
this is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time
we could use energy for more important things that people any need
that is why the movies should be censored
we started talking and i told her everything that was going on
our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is
i blame that grade on not having a computer at home
we can have teacher help tell the kids an let them no that it not right for them to watch that
there are way to many people on computers doing anything you can think of for hours
computers can do more harm then good in a house hold
anyway he used to be a cop and had a shotgun so we went out and tried it
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
that <percent> right for what they are think
there are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase
<caps> reads this memoir gets the feeling its a bright and warm place
most people do not know this but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes which is bad
they can relate to all different kinds of people
many books in todays libraries have offensive language
i have also experienced censorship in <caps> local library
the builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as a higher calling
some people use the computer to make music
seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before
i know i love reading sports magazines because i am a very true sports fan and sports are very important to me other than school
computers are a great way to communicate with others
<percent> <organization> people now a days do not spend anytime with family and <percent> <organization> people use computers to interact with friends
at <caps> the building was unable to simply put a mooring mast on top of the building
the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
we need to have these facts available to the general public
my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved
that is the time i was patient
censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to
the winds on the top of the building were constantly changing
a third reason is <caps> companies are able to use them to gain business
that was just the beginning of what was yet to come
all books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them
i hope what i have just explained now helps me make my
but we were patient and that she longed date ever the end
<person> sat for two hours
i was doing work to pass the time
we might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful
some people have an arid fear of change
the high school seemed lifeless in comparison with other schools we had played at in the past
within seconds i was ready to begin my test
i woke up the next day got dressed and prepared myself for laughter i was aware i would be keeling over because of
we all was in <num> car and vans
usually those kinds are
while i went and checked the bus schedule for the <organization> bus
when <organization> took a <num> min break i went to get a pop and all the lines where long
<caps> sweetie our tickets are for on <date> your <caps> going to have to be patient
i truly think that have a good laugh with your spouse is a good thing because it means that you are having a good time with each other
it was a closeknit community
the mood created by the author in the memoir is humble
yes i used the <caps> world but it was and is true
if people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies
the main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer
i think many people believe him to be a bit too wild and deranged to be a convincing argument
<caps> will never forget his home
so in social studies i wrote him a note
<caps> try to attempt an electric winch
i had <date> wait from <date>
they ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them
the second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself
<person> and i have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry
another challenge was the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure
you can shelter your children if you would like
the people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state went through many obstacles
and they should be going outside end running around
the designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the buildings frame
this had made me mad
human only have so long to live
another way the author created the mood was by telling us how caring his parents were
he told us he got lost
all of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water
you just cant do this because what if another persons wants that book and they can not have it
music is a way for someone to release their soul
basically it is <caps> somewhat
i know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and i still have these memories
at the end the author also mentions i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
the first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the u
also <percent> as the teenage population in the <caps>
i would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer
he does this by explaining what goes on in a positive light
people on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer
i was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day
that same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school
my family and friends looked at me and started to laugh
now we have more and more things we can laugh about
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i have never been in the <location> before and i have never been an exchange student
the skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking
that was when i was being patient
after we ate and <caps> drove me home we smiled and laughed as <caps> told me joke after joke
this quote means like before they came to the united states they had courage and now they were going to make it and be successful
explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature
she appreciated what her parents had done for her
she had us follow her to a room where we waited about forty five minutes for a doctor to come in and take us to the xray room
ill always be there for her also
my coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him
if laughter is the shortest distance between two people then if a guy or girl meets someone they like
my mom said i deserve it after being so patient all day
using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand
as you can see computers have helped students all across the
computers lower the price of things we want and need
everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion
i took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball
lets say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it
she just the point of the story across and its a cheerful way to end it
my first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture
the most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water
this describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up
there are many reasons and examples that support this
since there was such high winds on top of the building there was no feasible way to dock the blimp in less it was perfect weather
you can learn a lot from computers
blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings
<caps> called and pointed out that i had moved a piece when it was not <caps> turn
used hydrogen rather than helium the risks were higher
our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch
if something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them
a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
computers could also be helpful to plan a vacation
it was hilarious at first though
this dirigible being held by a single tether to the empire state building would put a large amount of stress on the buildings structure risking a possible collapse if continued
the helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles
laughter i think is a good important part of relationships too
it because the mother showed he how to love people
i do not think that is a good idea
i know from experience that being active and going outside or exercising really makes you feel good
he asked her to dance
it was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times
a momma bird was laying eggs
when we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along
she handed <person> a key with a large bulky wreath attached to it <person> told her it was outside behind the building
it is also fun and educational
another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often
i believe kids like me these day want to keep in touch with their friends
one day in class some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
the old man yells my boy
<caps> told me in a calm voice
i was babysitting with older cousin <person>
today i am going to talk about the time she goes shopping
but just to have fun an be silly
nobody showed any patience
i think about <person> and <person> laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming
after that first ride we decided we had better put an extra pillow up on the wall somehow
based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
my own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away
the greatest obstacle use of the mooring mast was nature itself
the woman who gave me life is an only child
he also ate all of my chips that i bot at <organization>
they could what there for three hours and not be herd
this is has the computer helps the world
the library is full of many books for all ages
this can cause great tension or sorrow in <caps> families
i really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like
the cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him
vs and but or rent them
we need to be careful about what is available to us and to the rest of the world
after about <num> hours id had enough
laughter in life is a good thing to have i believe
second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids
the next day she is on happy you are connected
dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down
last but not least that was a time that i was a patient person
you should love who you are and what you look like
all it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more
you would use a computer to get in touch with friends
there needed to be modifications made to make it safe for a dirigible to land there
thats one thing that need to be changed in the libraries
i had really hope i would like <caps> <caps> because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it
<person> yes mother going to have to deliver this baby okay
this setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the two hundred degrees
for they are very important
then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water
the fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone
so please for ever ones sake around you and in your life please laugh
we all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now
not only does typing quicker effect your computer techniques but <caps> also helps you outside of your home like in sports
also if you had nobody to talk to one time you <caps> go on the computer and try to meet new people
computers can keep you in with family and friends
that is why computers have a negative effect on people
another one would be that you could learn about another states and countries around the world
so we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair
i bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job
if you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer
the author of this memoir gave the memoir a peaceful mood
i threw myself back into the seat
books should be removed only if they are found a certain degree of offensive
almost every website has discounts
its the readers right to choose weather or not to read the material
they can start believing that they are nothing
there were three main obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast
we waited about two hours but it was worth it
the lack of suitable landing area
my first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use
<caps> about what society would be like
<caps> i check the hours and they were going to open in <num> minutes
years at the end of the school year
in the day described
that is some of the things that can affect the cyclist
the setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker
trust is a huge deal between friends
she was calling people to stand by the door to get ready to go to their next class
was a skinny boy in a black caps response to me
during projects a kid want know everything so a good way to get information is to goes on the computer and search what your looking <caps>
a good example would be this one class project we had to do
on a computer you can find great things about a place and people
now he understood the fact that love is never dependent on time
<caps> says they came to this country with such courage
all she needs is time
the book i am reading now is about a murder of a young girl
this shows the love that everyone has for one another
this is why handeye coordination is important to people
i conclusion there are reasons why a computer is good like hand eye coordinations learning about faraway places
i am a student from <caps>
all of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer
i hope we will still have the great time
i think that this would be fair for everyone
but <caps> he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow
this day was one of those kind of days
and the other reason was a safety reason most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen which is highly flammable
the sunrise that rose the morning of <date> at <num> am was the most welcoming sight i had ever seen
i blame myself for picking <caps> up in the first place
i often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about
computers have had a negative impact on todays society
it was week five at <caps> <caps>
but thats only the good things here are the bad
the mood that the author created was very happy and full of joy
we know so much more about other places now than we did before computers
no matter what you can not change the one you were meant to have
the architects would have to modify the building because a thousandfoot dirigible moored on the building would add stress to the building
if <caps> can change your day in such a big way than <caps> can change your life in a major way
when i am at work and kids laugh it makes me feel better even if i am having the worst day ever
this example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive
it was like i had two of my essential organs removed from my body
cries of mothers children whom they from
also because they had to leave their lives back at home and start all over again
the winds were always changing because the violent air currents
it was the hardest thing i have ever done
its as simple as that
my dad had to get xrays
the author also said that there was no way to express her gratitude for the generosity impressed upon her at such an early age
there are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water
the features of the setting effected the cyclist very much
it is a nasty part of reality
then everyone will know the answer
a library where there are no books to lose ones self in the pages
this is because she types and researches information all day long
it was here where i learned the definition of family
this is why computers are affecting every day people
he was very unhappy about the situation while we were all quite pleased
the effects that computers have on people are really something you should thank god for
what would this world be with no computers
thats a lot of many going toward fixing computers
the author says vowed to express positive connotation in the paragraph
i believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing
i feel like the mood in the memoir is being grateful for your family for many reasons
<caps> let a laugh of my own out
we heard <person> scream as <person> and i walked into my room
an example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous the <caps> of <organization>
the only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic
the computer games in handy almost all the time
if movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly
tears welded up in his eyes as my sister raced for him and my mom quickly walked behind
there was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countries blimp composition
computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles
soon people will be marrying them
without laughter there was no way i could have survived those school years
this mood is seen by how he tells the story of how his parents made the house they live in into a home
the pain will always be there
if there is something offensive about just ask a librarian if they can place that book or movie up higher on the shelves
my name is <caps> and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that are found offensive should be take off the shelves
this proves it is extremely hot outside
i feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives
these topics today are still among the things that happen in todays society
these three features are what effects the cyclist the most
having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life
the first day we were in eastern <organization> before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing
it can make your bond between each other stronger and can really repair any damage that has broken a relationship
one example is my cousin
after all i got patience and just waited until i got the text message back
<caps> respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were
the computer would help them find website that they could get a free education
people today are too worried about other people
his family always helped their friends and when family visited they always had a place to <caps>
fighting and killing is not good
there is actually more than one mood that is set in this memoir
more people get offended by lesser things now
being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important
he was also happy because his house was not just a house it was a home
i sat there for <num> hours with nothing to do never again will i do that
lastly computers benefit our society because they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire
i felt i was fine and fully capable of making friends myself
computers are great for communicating
the dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law
yes there are some youth that take somethings too seriously but thats because the parents are not there to explain
for that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible
you could sit forever and learn all about these magnificent creations
i could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society
censorship does not change the existence of that censored authors thoughts or the reality of what has occurred
i think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of a libraries
people nowadays are becoming smarter and smarter
people will take maps for a while and not want to go back to sleep and you wont have nothing else to do for the rest of the day
it also serves as a great place to exercise
i was laughing very hard at what i had just done and when my grandma came out i asked if we could go home
like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long they do not get enough exercise
this is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out
for one it is really hot
computers are helpful to us by doing work that has to be done neatly
my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family
i said in a weird voice
on our way it felt like two weeks
as you can see the computer has a lot of positives
the day came and for tryouts
she put her clothes on then she had to look for her shoes
<caps> asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth
so you want a story about being patient well your in lack
nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them
you wont be able to see how big your family is
there was always a strong sense of family and the house too
one last thing local newspaper is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time
third is its taking away authors money and point of view
the author also says how he admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly
i was so excited that i flew to my room and pounded cloths in my <caps> and looked through everything i would need
one time i was at home on the computer
computers are one of the most used tools on the planet
just keep in mind the dangers of the <caps> world and how it wants your money
i believe that some materials we have in our shelf belongs to basically anybody in the world
one thing is the water
he <caps> <person> if she accepted to be his girlfriend
the author admired his parents and was so touched by their teachings
i know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball
i was already soaked from head to toe but we still kept playing
and that such a person should put the shoe on the other foot as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view
this is how people use computers to stay in touch
the <organization> excuse for not having teachers teach <caps> to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday
technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park
the builders really should have planned this out better
should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive <caps> choice is no
though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it
they seemed they were not friends anymore
our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning
love for family and love for each other
i have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict
<caps> he was jumping around getting warmed up i see him trip and fall on his face
but if you start to laugh with them it takes the pressure off you and they are not longer laughing at you but now with you
he weighs threehundred pounds at the age fourteen
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and happy
he came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle
the authors voice is very blunt
for example in the story the girl saids ii failed the test
there was one <caps> in life when i was patient
if you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that <month> not be offensive at all
the the sun was beginning to beat down
his introduction was far less enthusiastic
even after my grandpa died in <date> and my older sister left for college
its never a good feeling when you know something is wrong
we had to bring her her own sleeping bag and camping chair to sit in
we should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read
all these things can be helpful and all you have to do is take in it and take advantage of free information that is given to you
offensive material can also grief
this person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did
we just bring up that day where we laughed at our selves for ten minuets
then you take a drink of something and start laughing again
this author did as well
the experience is not the same
when i was in the eighth grade i went to <location> for a church missions trip
everyone has a book they have read that does that to them
my parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family
so as you can see i highly disagree with the overuse of computers
they get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in
the greatest issue was safety
i knew <caps> they were about to tell me
but other movies are not even bad
my reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones
when it comes to censorship in libraries i feel that all the books should be left on the selves
that is one reason why i support the use of computers
you can see the towns and so much more
it also helps you make new friends
some people think this is a bad idea but i disagree
handeye coordination is a perfect example
not many like going out and enjoying nature
this law made it illegal for dirigibles to tether to the building or even approach it
or you could use the computer for school work or for work
children now a days know a lot of things and are intelligent about certain subjects
we enjoyed our lunch and got on the road because we still had a long trip on our hands
i wanted to go into my moms and dads room and wake them up
the last obstacle the builders faced was the law that it did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas
even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice
<caps> computers provide better and faster communication
you can be able to type well and very fast after a while and improve your eye sight by reading your writing or notes for a paper
public libraries are a far different story
there is hardly anything you cant do on a computer
<month> i mind you <caps> was very scary
its true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in
this game has made a great improvement on peoples lives
that means your going to have to not let it get under you skin or get over it
the builders of the empire state building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair
my legs tangled into knots and i could feel my head pounding
i once heard of an <caps> family complaining about a library because they removed a book about the <caps> religion
the person has that ability to read that book or not
a social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting dirigibles to dock there
so normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate
the hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch on fire and burn the empire state building down
so then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth
throughout everything you do in a day chatting with friends is a good way to relax and have fun
one of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents
he showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like
that would prevent the accidental discovery by children
another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the empire state building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a loving mood
by saying he was doing <num> when it should have been <num>
thats just not fair to others when they are trying to get some information
some games allow you design and play as a character you created
if you do not like the book do not have to get the book
i know people in that class still but its not the same because i knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other
the cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition <caps> slowed him down even more
it was illegal to fly close to the building or to dock at it
the library needs to make itself user friendly
the <caps> was just think his dad was
those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime
there in the dirt that lay just before me
kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered
in the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated
also when innertubing we got <caps> the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it
and thats what i think about library products like that
the experts at <organization> said <caps> the children do not stop going on computers then they with never see the true beauty of the outdoors
they meet <caps> at the counter and ask <caps>
yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast
then <person> looked up
be a bigger person and allow that person to live there dream through a story
the <caps> problem was the issue of safety
the architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building
it takes patience when you are out hunting
the cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him
if i had to say what mood this author created i would say happiness
cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society
without laughter one class in particular would be a nightmare
the violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan
if the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change
i wish people were as fast is i am during a test
smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill
in the story it says the sun was beginning to beat down
so at that point we only had a hour or so left i was so excited
music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are
at the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
<caps> was beyond irate
he felt like this problem was going to end him
walking down the walk way i ease into seat <num> as the show begins
i was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up
the features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally
that is why it says i will take that test again
the day before <num> <caps> <caps> i got all my things ready for that day
i had got the forest now meal
computers have been the big difference when comparing <num> to <num> centuries
not everyone agrees with that
the sparks danced together as if they were <caps> and the <location>
now a days more and more sites keep adapting and becoming known like bing
to display these materials
the author also ends with this paragraph because when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding
but then he pinned my down with his leg across mine
this holds true with everything including media
in paragraph <num> it states that the use of hydrogen rather than helium should have stopped the project
and the biggest detail you want to know is the cost and the computer can usually give you a close to exact price for everything
it is cool and breezy
i strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down
this is a great way to keep in contact with others
laughter is a medicine
no one talked to me or hung out with me at school
when they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got
children learn by watching and observing
they also have effect they help business people stay organized
they only become offensive when people think they are
if you spend hours a day on a computer your eyes can get permanently damaged
on any of those sites you interact with people
i started to grow up still no letters
the mood of the memoir was <caps>
music always contains warnings for the rating of the book
all of these resources that kids can find that has this kinda of material in it can be found in libraries
i have <caps> more patients said <person>
the bell rang for second period to start and i headed to my class
computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate
they set me down in the middle of the road
you wont see her but you can talk to her on the computer
i agree with these experts too
the back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue when it came to docking
i was putting myself between <person> and her so that they would stop fighting so much
i saw something bigs tail come out of the water
dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle
i do not like waiting in big lines
she was not even pretty at all
that is how the terrain affects the cyclist
wanting to do this could be very dangerous
it should be on the shelf even if it is offensive
if your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the <caps> is a sure easy thing
you <month> tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all
they do not exercise as much
what wont kill you will make you stronger
<caps> said that once or twice because <caps> knew it was true
so my <caps> told me to keep my brother and sister in their seats while he went o find my <caps> and sister
some such as playing sports
but i knew inside i felt a little bad
this story is about chicken hand the fox and a time he had to be patient
and the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves
many people have different views on different types of things
the major problem architect faced was that dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building because it has a law against airships flying to low over urban areas
paragraph <num> is a great example of how the mood created by the author is so happy
i solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family
my made us a good breakfast
we always make a list before we start the caroling
i love the libraries nothing will ever stop me from going
then when she was done we went back to snowmobiling for the rest of the day
please keep reading to hear my great ideas
so gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do
items are only offensive to certain people
moving on to the next topic
books should never be removed from libraries just because they <month> be found inappropriate
taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them
eventually we started a fire and moved our conversations outside
at any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians
everyone deserves to be heard
the sites could also bring you to your schools website
i only had <date> wait eleven days until the day of my first practice
i maneuvered down the hill
this is a fun activity to learn a little more about people and to help <person> to remember our names
and they are great for people with jobs
no one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again
thank you for your time
these features of the setting had to affect the cyclist
in the last sentence of the memoir it says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
he is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat
the author of the memoir creates a very a grateful and happy mood
people of all different ages and anyone is welcome to come in the library
those are obstacles the builders faced when building the empire state building
most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects
when we cut down trees we are harming our environment
that is the question
after we got through security we though we would never get there
studies show that <percent> of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer
the <time> day we had to pay him a little bit of money not all of it yet but some of it and we went to our hotel room
the cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting
every night that she was there we would always stay up
all of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone
i hope one day we can all turn off out computers for good
you <month> not realize it out <date> is a whole month away from my <date>
plus computers let you chat to people on there computer even if you cant call them
this shows how it could be potentially dangerous for the passengers of the dirigible to get off
so we sat there patiently and ordered are food and left to go to the football game
which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water
i finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship
such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk
<person> was going to take a picture of everyone for picture id on her phone
this one band got banned in the united states of <location> for there music
i think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that
he said we were going on a trip to <location> so he could go to <location> before he left this world
they would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive
i encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life
the story is somewhat sad
<caps> is very important in a relationship
those <caps> my favorite
being allowed to write how they feel is what <location> is practically based on
computers are a fad that will never die out
changing a persons life is not easy
one day my plea will be heard
the best ride at <organization> was over <num> hours long wait
this is a perfect way for communication and business
she was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence
everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite
some of the language they use such as retard i find offensive
i told her how i felt about what those girls did to me and how it felt like the world always would agree with whatever they said
just so that there <caps> could have a better life made the mood and the readers proud of the parents
these lifechanging books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up
the next few days where hard
and that my friends is not alright
i feel since i have <caps> i speak a different language that most people cant understand besides <caps> friends with <caps>
the kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour
with information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn
computers benefit society more than you would think
he would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor
so i hurry up and put my money in my pocket
the huge world of the <caps> can change our lives
something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry
another problem they faced was the impracticality of the dirigibles themselves
i was completely right
at another point in the <caps> the author created a <caps> <caps>
kids need to understand what books are good for them from there age and otherwise their brain will start confusing them at their age
computers have been improved to do many different things without them we would barely get any thing done
they should only be aloud to put <num> stuff on the shelves
what a day well l guess my family does have patience well not my step dad
instead you can exercise
laughter brings people together and creates bonds that will last a lifetime
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
communicating with others
the library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone
books that deal with slavery <month> also be found offensive like the book <caps>
its just simply means everyone in this world is not the same
the triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won
the features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard
i never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away i was surprised
she is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time
sometimes i get impatient because people are annoying me
yea <person> has a <caps> but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion
adults know what is right from wrong than what children do
laughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united
on my way to <state> i was patient because i had to wait for the buses
i bought me and <caps> mom a pair of comfortable slippers
my cat is the king of my house
i had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it
so he had to move around it
you can save anything on a computer
computer is something people use to talk to people and keep in contact
some books can have violent language and actions in the book
<caps> that was the sound of a light bulb going off in your head
the show many dieting plans such as <person> or <person>
when the two weeks were finally over i had about <money> saved up and i was practically bouncing off the walls because i was so excited
different people have different ways of making others laugh
because moving was a very hard for her
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
in literature and art things take a more serious tone than in music and other media
daily exercise while having fun beats just having fun on a computer
so that is my input on the situation
so people should do some of the other things i said instead of just going on the computer all of the time
that took about <num> hour and a half
that was my story about the time i had to be patient
<caps> back some of <caps> best friendships were brought up through laughter
the features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert
limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them
having laughterfilled relationships is an important element to someones well being
many people can agree with me
this made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast
those are my reasons now let me explain them
like everything is going to be alright
would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us
he just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid
people are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting
standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he could not continue further
i hope i have convinced you to see my side of the argument and thank you for your time
then i had to just walk around doing nothing
the builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building
they teach people about history and faraway places
the computer only benefits you in a way
i had never hung <caps> on anyone before
the authors mood is very grateful
our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a little higher
the builders would then have to modify and strengthen the empire state building to this new situation
she literally just called me and asked if i wanted to go to cedar point the next day
as i was laying there i began hearing foot steps
we have a good time and really enjoy ourselves
with books for there age
well i have <caps> can be easily uploaded in a matter of minutes
everyone has interests in different types
this family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one
this lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on
he is the one male figure that i still have in my life
if theres a test on <date>
advances in technology are great
the first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public
if you take these things away certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things could possibly read
my parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family
they could throw the music out
let me tell you some important facts about the computer
then i will take the test again
our moods totally changed once that happened
that day was a lot of fun
the excerpt clearly explains the complications the builders had to endure and take into thought when constructing the empire state building
but things were said to one another
i put my shoes on and headed back out the door
but one should know the dangers of censorship
that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him
she raised her sleepy eyed face
i believe that every parent has the right to oversee what there child reads
with modern day technology all that is possible
if us children did not learn that at an early age many of them would be in some very rough situations today
if i was unable to do what i like to do i would probably be angry or depressed
laughter is an important element in a relationship
people spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change
parents always say that it is a selfcontrol issue but many adults have the same problem
i strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out the library
just because one person has different beliefs or what their standard is for offensive would not change my stand point on the censorship of certain articles
this can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines
computers help us learn and communicate
i was so tired i almost fell asleep on the floor
this is why computers are valuable to everyday life
censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelfs because they are considered offensive
many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life
there is always meaning within
the kids at the park thought it was funny and were laughing at me
the child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book
but we just cant get the nerve to do it
this awkwardness can also ruin previously close friendships
<caps> go of a problem while laughing is the best way to get rid of problems
i would do anything for her
<caps> even stood by <caps> mothers side when i was born
i learned that good things come to people who wait
schools also are teaching us about the computer <caps> as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more
just make a new section for it
music and movies are a different story
he finally got to <person> at <time> <person> and her crew notified <person> that he won the patience contest
the second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas
family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness
soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid
laughter has brought me to that place
no books would be left if we censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book
censorship of music and movies is not right either
<caps> quickly made his way over to me and <person> and introduced himself
i looked at the teacher and she started busting out laughing
you must be tolerant and understanding
the cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man
if there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
if you take a look at politics you can see that not everybody has the same opinion and some can be very vocal about theirs
they are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms
it is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age
we all are going to eat so we should wait
having a good sense of humor is very important these days
therefore causing grades to go down or not complete home work on time
everyone has their own opinions
i hope you agree on my topic
i ask one more time <caps> <caps> leave please
i looked at the contact
family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love
censoring books is very important in todays lifestyle
<date> is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age
we live off of knowledge
for movies there are many different types
they had failed to predict the potential problems that they would face
one <time> i woke up at <time> to go take pictures for our passports
i get angry at the smallest things
no more than <num> to <num> mile per hour
architects could not place a mooring mast on top of the empire state building
and talking with other people just makes us happy
and then we have no books on the shelf for any of us
in this house he had the innocence of childhood
the biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality
they are useful ways to make life easier
those were some obstacles that builders faced and prevented to making of a mooring mast to let dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
i think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning
the easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sitandchat session for better understanding
l opened my envelope
another problem that the builders faced was safety
patience can really help you in life some times its the only thing that can keep us sane
the greatest obstacle was nature
the second <caps> is to be able to talk to other people on line
the last point i will make is that no information is bad information
what one person might not like the next person might love
this made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo
until one <date> i saw a <caps>
also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions
it the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning
i felt happy that we finally left <caps> sad
we show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic
after <num> minutes i was pondering where <caps> could be
everyone should be able to watch what ever they want with out it having to be censored
<caps> is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the <caps> language
<caps> in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race
we can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them
most of these songs they sing now is about dumb things that do not mean anything
school websites also give people benefits in our society
finally i was time to go hot no one was happy except for me
we need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them
others might only use it for chat and email
it was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner
we all continued laughing and kept talking about <caps> had just happened for the next <num> minutes
the architects of the empire state building were threatened by the possible obstacles of constructing a mooring mast atop the building
this is useful for families who life a good distance from each other
her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way
we quickly put our snow cloths on and began running for the door
this shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water
that was just enough to get <location> home
the water was faster then i thought as i let it <caps> me
it took me some time but i finally found my drama class
these things are a great solution to the rising lost of entertainment
while i went to the bathroom <person> asked one of the store clerks where we could find this <caps>
so we walked up to the store and we opened the door and there had to be over <date> people in the store
if a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster
and i ordered my drink and mike was the first one
with the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city
in my life laughing and smiling and having fun is a big deal
and <caps> which is for all age groups
as you reading you will find out my second reason fro being to much in the computer
in the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help
instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away
my oldest sister <person> had just gone to collage so my sister <person> and me got the chance to get to know each other a whole lot more
people are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested
this was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer
that person is my sister
i was back stage with my dance team going over routine for the third time
no one should be denied the chance to learn
the name of the was halo reach
the mooring mast has two obstacles <caps> the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents
its not up to us to make that choice
that day i learned a lot on how it is important to be patient
the first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could with hold the stress of the dirigibles load
computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you
<caps> mom and brother were out late
if you do that for week you will be very tired and sleepy
and even if they are its for studying learning of catching up with old friends
thank you for your time
sometimes she is so oblivious that <caps> is just hard not to laugh at her
there was like <num> people there
the cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak
computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day
another issue with safety
a time when i was patient was when <date> we drove to <location>
the guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away
many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences
jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in <date> minuets for less using the computer
in her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear
some say that one should have the right to censor a book that they find offensive
these are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong
i can see how some of those books could be banned
a lots of uneducated children that stay home or do drugs in the street
the classroom was dead quiet <caps> could even hear a pen drop
friends and family are not people to take advantage of
that is how the mood is set
each day it felt like i was in jail
we can also use it to learn about news happening around the world
as the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused
reading different types of literature <caps> a terrific way of learning and library shelves should <caps> be stripped of the books occupying the space
she is determined to pass the test
also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we here in these days
you can also learn ahead far away places with a computer
when i was young i never really like libraries because they seem boring to me
it was in this simple house
the designers designed a new tower that was a shinny glass and chromenickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside
computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way
for some it <month> be pictures
if you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they <month> need those kinds of books for
they make fun of them because they are not like others and they can take that very offensive
so he drank more water than usual
take anatomy books for example
i know but you deserve it
and this line was really long
they get threatening emails
i asked what was the matter and she said were going to potter park zoo
it all depends on where you are cycling
my family and family friends went on a camping trip
an example is when i wanted to see <location> their was a <caps> line
after that first point it went down hill we let them get the best of us and they won the set
would be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
in paragraph <num> the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences
it was amazing going under the waterfall
his parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to <location>
some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work
let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call good times
laughter has no age limit
just recently there been earthquakes in <location> and <location> you can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need
i can see why they put it on the kids shows
another obstacle builders faced were safety issues
this our only chance to save the white <organization>
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
all we had to accomplish was to take pictures of eachother <caps> the things that we like <caps> dislike
good and bad things come from this
it felt like thousands of people were in the hallway looking at me
parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends
one time i had to be patient was on my birthday
also some books help prepare a person for the outside world
another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others
laughter can bring <caps> instantly to enjoyment no matter how unbearable the struggles in your life <month> be
<caps> probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito
even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two
the next reason is there are laws against airships flying too low over urban areas
it was the being of the <date>
finally the doctor called my name
by removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed
most places have what they call late fees
the computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich ones life
he had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed
the author was very grateful and appreciative for his parents and this memoir for their cooking skills and courageousness
the flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration
you could write an email or talk to them in a chat
from the excerpt the mooring mast by <organization> we find that the builders of the empire state building encountered many obstacles
<caps> had to settle for what was given to him at the time
if that was me writing that story i would make the mood very grateful towards my parents
you are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book
censorship in the libraries
my dad every day when he comes to pick <caps> up he always has something funny to say
the builders faced many obstacles in building a moor to dock dirigibles
that would have been the life
let people out to see what this world is like and its various types of art
since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good
it helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play
its makes some things in life much easier
<caps> they teach you how to use a computer
there was this time that i had to take a writing test
my second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper
the plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed
also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life
you can talk to people on <caps> or email each other and have a conversation with them
when i walked up to the living room i noticed the girls were making food for the guys while the guys were playing drinking games
laughter consists of many different factors
but others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff
the wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there
i think that if they do that they might just take some <caps>
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof
many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs
it is the most boring friendship two people could have
all in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material
no one is making you watch or read any of that
we brought them home and we let them explore all around our house
when i can make someone else laugh or giggle <caps> not only makes me fill good but also the other person i was talking to
the things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings
the speed limit was 55 mph
since his nickname is <caps> <caps> you can only guess <caps> he asked us next
you as a parent should do your best to keep them away from those things you do not want them to see or hear
if helps you and other respect yourself
there is no way to express my gratitude
he would pick me up and then we would go to either <organization> or <caps> for lunch
as long as there are other readers and people who like those kinds of books and music then they should keep them on the shelf
when i had the chance i asked her to be my date for the <date> formal which would be one of the most special nights of my freshmen year
this how organize my ideas
we are also taught how to correctly cite and research work
many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun
on the way it was kind of quiet but it was somehow worth it
the route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water
he is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him
there is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas
i think about <organization> and i running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet
classifying something as offensive is an opinion
now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them
its just a natural part of growing up
if <caps> wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well
it can also help learn a lot of things
in conclusion builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their
there are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want
the second major obstacle was controlling a dirigible in the often violent winds at the top of the tower
we flew to <location> well and the to <organization> but after that it was down hill
i was laughing <caps> hard but i was also upset cause my pool is already broken
<caps> <caps> how it was to make his first friend
for example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well
she had asked for some chopsticks and the <caps> made us wait for <num> minutes for chopsticks
wile we was in there i lost ten pounds
so thats why they have there on area to be in
<organization> took a poll about how many <caps> use the computer to do research and <percent> answered that they did
winter is the gettingready stage
also the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation
i guess you could say we developed a game
<person> face turned bright red as he watched his girlfriend pay the bill
the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another
my first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer
she would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of <caps>
it was starting to become daylight and he had to walk <num> miles to get to the next town
libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste
also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer
during practice our <caps> had been explaining directions to one of the drills
for a month or so he had been saving up his extra money for a new <caps>
the building was there but it was abandoned
no one can never make everybody happy
there would be so many conflicts if this happened
the reason why i choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for there class and their research for whatever class they need it for
i could hear <person> talking to <organization> but i was making my my mind convoluted
well i can tell you that i do that all the time and that laughter is a big part of my life
that is how this memoir makes me feel once i read it
another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads
until <caps> almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands
others people without a gob are not looking for something to do they are at the computer everyday
breathe by breath running i could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request
he could take the entire <num> minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do
even great novels like the <caps> in the <caps> should not be banned because of their content
the addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or <caps> <caps> you see are real life situations and activities
this is what the mood was in the memoir of <person> was portrayed as
every where you go you need some patience
this project was vehement
thats at least <caps> i thought
i won a contest that allowed me to do that
<caps> believes this is pulling her family apart
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelfthat work i abhorthen you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
this quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader
mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive
no computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often
it was here where i learned the real definition of family
i find <caps> in the <caps> to be dangerously inappropriate
the winds at the top of the building were always shifting cause of violent air currents
i do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life
other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life
another factor affecting building was nature
a grin decorated my face from one ear to the other and my good sense came back to me gracefully
this is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t
laughter is very important
he can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions
that idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out
this is a book giving the kids to see how things were
in conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful
to me censorship laws in libraries are not needed
she buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden
<person> almost enjoyed waiting it made her more excited for things
it is a good way for people to get to know you
i lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today <caps> ready to work hard and keep my patience
the only problem was that they were all sold out
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
you can do other stuff and still learn without being on the computer
dirigibles are flammable and could easily injure and kill people if an accident happened
that moment changed the way i laugh today
we were out side chewing while <organization> was peeing on his dads car
this was a horrible action because the <caps> religion is an extremely interesting one and now many people will never know anything about it
the one person i think that has made <caps> laugh the most is probably my dad
these are some moods the author creates throughout the memoir
it sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is
these problems go to show that owners of the empire state building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there
so i urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology
putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids wont be able to access it
looking forward to what my <date> was going to look like
and like i said before they really not bad there like a little guide to many people
so i am going to tell you
the <caps> states i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
one of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower
she thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life
so i hope you enjoyed reading <caps> essay
many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come
the <caps> states the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do
i grew fond of whatever feeling or humor i was giving off to this new kid
many people have laptops in their home or with them
fake and dangerous info when we have book
this paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the united states instead of her home
someone might need a certain book for a project
in his last one <person> was getting older and he knew he would be tested
just yesterday i found out that the human body can not survive without its liver
the bikers feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did
i <caps> you will come through to yourself and agree
the cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way
<person> laughed at him and then thought <caps> i play with him then my other friend will be mad
one of the reasons f think computers have a bad effect on people is addictions
another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting
i asked <caps> we laughed again
i practiced all day long
patiences helps us make the right choice
also they help with your school and job work
people of different races and cultures <month> have another opinion on the situation of censorship
these had gangedup against him in his trip
the something with technology
the architects had to redesign the whole top of the building
no one wants to be that way
its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends
do something else than be on
a example from the memoir is when the author talks about his gratefulness toward his parents
this feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy
i said as i was running to my parents room
using computers could possibly save your life one day
i know i was going to start one now same we
they have already caused exponential advancement
we were being very patient
another obstacle the builders faced was the law
not all things adults do are not appropriate for the young eyes
only time could tell
we have been told that some people think were spending too much time on the computer
we make up the story about our laundry
most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable
thats called interacting talking about it
the features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available
this mans life was very successful because his traits would show about his community
i was the first one there
the mood in the story is thankful
because other readers might just wont to read it
choose it because it looks interesting and its something you might enjoy
<caps> in front of a <caps> all <caps> does not support you with the natural urge to exercise
if i was one of those who took offense to a book in the library then i would just keep it to myself
i was just ready to left everybody when finally came our time
a second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research
these materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people
admiration for their strength and perseverance
she was embarrassed for weeks after it happened
that is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic
one of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away
because theirs always some one out their that likes that one book that you might want to throw away
you can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes
i was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend
they could possible made it strong but at high cost to something so <caps> already
one of my fathers friends had everything on his computer
but she still had to do her homework
one time i was patient was when i was at basketball practice
in paragraph <num> the architects say that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building
he was getting tired quick
you can do lots of stuff with computers such as help people learn new things almost about everything
our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public
there are different kinds of channels that view these materials
nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered
i believe that no one should decide for us
would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay
we decided to go look inside <caps> <caps> first because they have all the crazy things we love
but there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the empire state building
someone else might like it
it keeps them going on a regular day basis
everyone has their own opinion on whats offensive and whats not
the mood created by the author is touching
it was about a five hour drive
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
with this people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side tracked and forget to do homeworks
the author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance
at the <caps> office i was waiting in the room for her to come back
i use computers a lot
computers can do more harm than good
magazines are nothing but gossip
the winds would make a airship <caps> around like crazy
if all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this
i strongly believe computers do benefit society
it was a night more coming true
but since i come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe
however the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it
been for computers and <organization>
that is a time when i was patient
in a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country where i celebrated my first birthdays
<caps> room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that <caps> had done
one obstacle that they faced concerned safety
i think computer have shaped <location> to what it is today
there is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line
you just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are
it makes a bad impression on some people
many <caps> have different opinions about whats appropriate and whats not
your culture is a part of the mood of the story
nothing but drama and not happiness
so they decided to make the building shorter
these are all the things that computers take away from people
he got out and then all heard was hollers and screams
let it go and stick to what you know and like
waiting for my child was the longest <num> hours of my life
the architects of the empire state building faced too many challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles
our <organization> is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them
another obstacle was that the dirigibles from outside of the u
when we got to <location> we hurry to the island school to see my sister
i was shocked to hear my <caps> say that
for example i use laughter between me and my boyfriend <person>
i finally rolled up my window looked at my dad
their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building
another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor or at the empire state building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
they often find their joy in these things
my opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day
many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language
so <caps> being the smart <caps> he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
it was funny because <caps> ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around
there was no way this was going to work out so they stopped moving forward on this <caps>
the author also shows how close their family is
that is the time when i had to be patient to get something that i really wanted
i heard someone knock in my door
many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show
to take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers
these are the sites you use to access information from others to making plans for the weekend
the greatest obstacle was the wind on top of the building
next time you have to be patient just thing good thing come to those who wait
a convenient way to do this was by using a computer
the <caps> has enough water in it to flood the earth
now it was time to go on more rides and not complain
i do not agree that reading material or anything in that matter should be taken off of a shelf
you have to look at it from their view
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says twenty miles up the road
where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around <caps>
people have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around
emotions that you cant describe
i feel sorry for these people
it takes away freedom
people have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not
there are games with virtual worlds or games that are fun and have no meaning
when they got here we get to eat cake
well one day when my parents went out shopping me and my sister <person> stayed home to clean the house
the computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know
many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others
then later she started and still is dating the guy we are renting awe house from
one would always grab my legs the other would grab my arms and they would swing me until they just t threw me in the pool
and sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older
then there was a law that air craft should not fly too low over urban areas
nature was also a large obstacle
that means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her
to give their children a better life
i can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves
these materials should be taken off the shelves because children reading or looking at these kinds of books and magazines in libraries should not be happening
being stupid a chased after it on my belly to get it
these are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday
s used hydrogen rather than helium
i told her i will always be one phone call away not two but one
today <person> and i are as close as we were in fifth grade if not closer
he also mentions how grateful he was to have a caring and loving family to be brought up in
you can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot
when it can be an educational resource it is very helpful
this is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about
this implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings
i am lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh
this was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible
during the construction of the mooring mast atop the empire state building the builders faced several obstacles
that thing cost to much money to get lost or broken
please when you are writing you article before and listen to my facts
computers are a serious issue
one time i was patient was when i was in science class taking a test
so by me being the second oldest i find it <caps> responsibility to take care of <caps> mom
he would never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home
they allow us to talk with people all over the world
i would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so a test of my inner spirit
so that proves computer is a great machine
my last reason is that computers are the general health of people today
the mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone
the mood of the story is happy
just think about being away from them <caps> all my friends in <location> for such a long time made my stomach sick
another good reason why computer are good for people is that it helps your interact with your friends and family <caps> you cant see them
we had to make his last <caps> a great one to end on
00 though because of the drive
computers can help with our educational needs
so then you spend <caps> nights in bed tossing and turning
i can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all <caps> important information organized
another obstacle to the builders was nature
you can meet new people and is a good way to make life even better
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one
the thing i loved most about him was how he could make me happy when i felt so down
the workers had to finish the roof before the mast could be framed
spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body
this is why i support the computers
the foods eaten there and what the weather is like
the effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved
everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended
the boy said a joke about <caps>
he always waited for every else and he never complained
another issue libraries have is music and movies
i think that no books should be taken away
so i think computers are very important and they are needed in people lives
that requires a ton of patience because she takes forever
<caps> <caps> i had shouted
although they use computers for a good reason people should make time for outside
another thing libraries need to watch are magazines
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
we are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad
this shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight
well on this particular day <person> and i chose to spy on the neighbors
when the dirigibles would dock violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the mooring mast
you can say computers have a very positive effect on people or say computers have a very negative effect on people
the builders main problem with safety
a variety of people could take offense to the content this <caps> contains
the narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor
not even waste minutes on you phone
i flung my fishing lips into the water and waited
we usually read over the list of words before we look for them
during the construction of the empire state building builders faced many obstacles with attempting to allow a dirigible to dock there
it started in third grade
his attitude changed greatly throughout the story
<caps> explained as all of us relaxed next too his dark blue <caps> which was gracefully parked right out side of my house
there are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves
if there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty
the constant threat of wind made the plans too dangerous as well
that she would be better off without him there
neither of the dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings
just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff
they could easily catch on fire and harm many innocent people
she plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol
also could not think for themselves because the <organization> censored everything you could think of
from ants to <location> its all there
computers can also help people communicate with each other
the possibilities were just to unlikely
one obstacle was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
this is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world
this shows us teenager to think like our lives depended on it
we were rushing through the papers scared some one else was planning to adopt him
these are the reasons why the mooring mast was unsuccessful on the empire state building
the mood of the memoir is appreciation
i feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world i would like to live in
this is the time when i was patient
after we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday
with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools
its very important that people stop spending a lot of time on the computer to make sure an addiction is prevented before it can even start
this is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive
music is sometimes said to help people cope with life problems
so of course i was upset
one major problem was safety
a day of dreadful patience can we leave now <caps>
people can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language
i will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call
i believe that computers have bad effect on people
i hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts
<caps> a eighth grader i won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without <caps> a full match
i believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life
once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour andahalf the computer will start to effect you in negative ways
my mom had called me and i was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza
a few minutes later she went to every student and checked there answers
in the essay do not <caps> posted speed limit the setting effects the cyclist in many ways
but instead of just going and sitting on the couch for the whole night you could go to the computer and do a fun game for a little while
if books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now
libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner
first of all let say you have a very close friend move outofstate how are you going to keep in touch
i had woke up at six and jumped out of bed
a couple of days later we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do when we older and out of high school
in the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think
we would all have a grudge and for no reason to have one and just live in black and white all the time
also in the <caps> a boy challenges his <caps> society because they too censored certain things
she came up with a plan that she said would make her win
well my uncle did and was very patient about it
if someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable
this can range from the <caps>
you can keep touch with them through <caps> or email
kids should no the limit
lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days
we both began to dig through the bucket
i left to go on some rides and when i came back the poor little girl was still there
the author shows a willingness to try harder in this story
he is grateful for that
the first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town
after looking and looking we finally found <caps>
there are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics
but also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has
the final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city
typing without looking at the keyboard is handeye coordination
the readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive
i hate how gorgeous you are <person>
no reading material should be taken off the shelf
different websites can expose the wrong thing and get you into trouble
my little sister loves going to the library
next week the out or came
my grandpa and i sat right across from each other like we always would and made the most unusual faces at each other
because they can help people find information they need
do what you think and feel is cool
in recent years studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active
pretty much like <caps> of <caps>
i was so excited i almost screamed
and the country is <location>
everything is normal again and we go to check out
that light switch in <caps> body that causes <caps> brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness
bus tickets cost a lot of money
for an example who is harry <person>
out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks
computers can and will take away family and friend time
libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind
it helps the reader make connections because all of our relatives know better how long ago made sacrifices for their family
<person> took his time doing step by step instructions and no time his rocket was done
the setting affects the cyclist in many ways
it allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others
when i got home i told my parents and they were excited for me
my cousin is a big <person> fan
i know i sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that i read to study
a lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of todays society
so i promptly went up to two older women and asked to play a game with them
so we brought the game and played it tell we beat it
communicating with people on the other side of the world is difficult
i would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication
<caps> replied with this certain smile on her face
this is my opinion of the statement
so by the time the opening act got done i was soaked
it all depends on the persons own interests and choices
computers play a large part in the <caps> of the world
the whole way home i was skating on ice
i think that books or magazines or movies with <caps> content should be removed from libraries if they see it fit
in <person> head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient
the man was talking about me
the author values relationships and he is grateful to have his family
t wanted to ask my older brother
it exploded right on her face
there are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see
he would listen and care as if it was his problem also
for example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game
thats a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building
eighty eight percent of <caps> voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends
we walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets
we absolutely did not want the movie to end and yet it still did
in order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems
it was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub
the wind made this hard for the dirigibles to land
is a person does not have good handeye coordination
for example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better
so they try to get them out of the library
computers are bad for society
it was a closeknit community
this <caps> hurts them in the long run
me and my mom went on stake line tack
a computer can also play music
the setting was the main affect on the cyclist
its very short and you wish that it could of been longer
this is why the builders had faced so many problems
then i noticed that the other group of people
the most important function of the computer is education
i was told i was too young for one
i personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves
but i said that everyone has it cant i just get it now
it is where the author is trying to show to the reader
the people who do not find it offensive might actually want to read them
and this is why <caps> or <caps> or whoever invented sadists and masochists
laughter <month> be the best part of life
is it worth it to use all that time
computers help people communicate with other people
here is example of me being patient for my birthday
i can be patient when i am waiting short periods of time
another thing is that <caps> is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff
i only get to see him because a lot of money to come
a second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket
it helps us remember the fun times during the bad times
being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world
they sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches
students would get in my face wanting to know what school i came from and wanted to know all about me
i told myself the school day
that is one reason i think the books should stay on the shelves
he had great creativity and wanted to use his building to full potential
<person> was <num> and <organization> was <num>
it sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser
<caps> were just three of the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
even though they had a prototype that work they discontinued the project giving air planes the better way to travel in the air
i hope you are patience at times too
at one <caps> in left you would have to be patient
they need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book
well you can use the computer to look up the words
it makes him become very dehydrated
i said grandma <caps> cant we do that please
soon after eating we started playing hide and seek in the orchard
we just started laughing it was really embarrassing
however she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back
i had vocals <caps> is a galore to deal with
the biggest obstacle was the winds
if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned
you can chat with all your friends at once
because children pick up everything they hear and see
it should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed
i am going to tell you about a time when i was patient
i believe that this should take place at every library around the world
i was happy because now i get to go to sleep in the rental van
there is no predicting that that could never happen again
because of the computer we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event
to this day i still feel an empty space in my heart <caps> my best friend once was
<caps> thought he was annoying which caused to a small fight
this shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime
the snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey
all i did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes
now i can just go on the website and find out everything i wanted to know about that place
it shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail
the weight of the building also the weight of the lead weights might collapse the structure
this is why i think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them
the frame was not strong enough to support the dirigibles when docked so the had to reinforce the frame to withstand the strain the dirigibles would present
i flew off the skateboard and landed on <caps> butt on the cement
books should not be required to meet everyones personal standards
one reason was because of safety
some parents can prevent it from happening
lots of people life that we had computers they have lots of benefits that come with having computers
it can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk
some people think that offensive books should be removed from library shelves
this is the major element that and him in the story
her parents probably belong to some mafia or something
so get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive
there were many obstacles the builders faced
my <caps> class had all girls and one boy
i believe people would get upset if they would banned the stuff they love
he also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the united states
favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time
this unsafe why would the build something harmful to others
all of those computer related things would not there for <caps> there were no computer
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things i learned there about how to love
this is how computers come in handy in every day life
they can also perfect the skill of handeye coordination
this made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination
people have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it
when i was six years old we a driving game
computers have varies websites such as <caps> and <caps> which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework
realizing you turned your house into a home
i quick explained as i ran out of breath
she walks home and finds a hibiscus
come the there as i have to open my stocking
finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future
books need to be censored in school libraries because some children <month> be too immature to handle the subject matter within the books pages
maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about
its not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kids magazine
that was quick i thought
help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics
my brother and sister lives with them
the girl that was sitting next to me moved and sat next to <person>
they make his journey seem hopeless
its proven that <num> students who use computers from schoolwork they make learning easier as well
when <date> come around we all ways do a musical every years
so you can see why my family does not like computers
that is why i go against taking books out that are not favored by others
books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them
<caps> we began to walk down the ramp from the high school
i liked to explore the library and find new things
once i eat i have to be patient for gym
i was really happy to hear that and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever
i was becoming impatience just waiting their
the topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years
computers are a good way to keep in touch with people
my closest friends and i joke around and laugh about numerous things
i even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all i got for an answer was a because
by using censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves
or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day
finally the fear of the blimp going <caps> another buildings spire puncturing a hole in the blimp causing it to crash
exercise is necessary in <caps> lives
she is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better
<person> was a only child living with her mother and <caps>
my family being immigrants from another country my family
getting close to <date>
some times i think i rush things a little bit too much
but i know this because its says then i will take that test again her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant
this is a very happy paragraph to complete the happy mood of the story
<caps> thing is that he also learned what family really means
so many uses for the computer
it would mean a lot to your friends it you just take time to say hello through email
she vows silently that in a year she will take the test again
the mall i was searched happy me and my brothers and sisters
<caps> was right i guess
it is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster
i started smiling and laughing because i was so happy that he could
playing sports can also help you get stronger
high winds and laws prevented the <caps> from ever being used
or i can also talk to friends after a long day of school
the instant message is probably the must used by teens
i used patience when i went to ceder point <caps> i used it was that i playing video game
i said i know <caps> can be a bit hardheaded but i make you ride him because i believe you can handle him
if a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad
when we turned <caps> in the lady said we had a back side too
he would do this day after day
when our days go sour laughter is there to sweeten it up
they can just over look these books and pick another
they should censor what their children do
the architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges
i think she is looking to start over and forget about failing
all we need is a little more organization
no wait thats a lie <person> <caps> nature period
laughter is important in a relationship
a favorite book of many kids is the <caps> <caps> series
i had made the greatest friend i had ever had
this shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life
finally the <date> bell of the <date> rang and <person> and i ran to our locker to meet up and get all of our stuff to go home
some people have different tastes in movies
it is a place filled with knowledge and information
the author also gives a sad mood at the memoir
you would be putting someone out their job
this could be in more ways than one
i would close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time and eventually stopped trying
also most of kids parents can contact their teacher and email them to see how they are doing
then <person> had to go to the bathroom
this shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist
the above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist
laughter is all around
as we laughed the time seemed to fly by as if we were in a time warp
that person then could end up using the information for the worst
from many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries
or could have made a difference my making them laugh
which needs to end now these beautiful land marks across the world are being wasted because hardly any ones looking at them
my last reason is that computers help lower your stress level by playing games
since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself
i do believe they are very handy
he was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment
so we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit
thats not right at all
they might not want their kids to read it but their kids will still hear the same things somewhere else also
over the years it has become harder to censor magazines
with computers a business in <location> or somewhere else in <location> can be connected with a building in <location>
everything seemed normal for what felt like a second and then <person> explained the gut feeling i had when i was walking home from school that day
if someone dose not agree to what another person is reading they don have to be there
computers are one of the best things that has happened to me and my life
<caps> is grateful for their love and sacrifice
families now a days are being broken up due to computers
after everyone was served they all took a bite out of it
so for his birthday i decided an getting him a computer
he also says how grateful he is for his parents
by making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor
violent winds would make dirigibles unstable when docked to the building
this is when <person> and <organization> stared talking to each other and both of them found that they enjoyed each others laughter they became vary close friends
they find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them
i also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new technology
kids need to get away from the computer
i want to explain to you how i feel about computers personally
so i did not get that book i just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong
the author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family
in the <caps> it grants freedom of expression
he writes could afford to into a modest three room apartment
these are the reasons why i think that they are not spending to much times on the computers
self esteem and greedy
that was when <caps> dad was very patient
it was my favorite part <organization> everyday
you also have friends page to see how you are doing
these two challenges ended up making the use of the mooring mast impossible
the main reason is there is always going to be conflict between <num> or more groups of people
i think laughter is good for a relationships and here is why
for example everyday i get out of school i do my homework and i go run a mile
i waited for <num> min but it felt like <num> years
i believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
they must learn the good from the bad sometime
books that are found inappropriate to children or even teenagers should be reconsidered to be removed off shelves that are exposed to children or teenagers
computers are addicting
the winds were too strong
it seemed to be funner than <organization> because in the week we were there we spent more time laughing and swimming down by the pool than actually in <location>
so much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use
i wanted to get a really nice pool for everyone
the cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut
where you and your family would be to many dangers
then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line
its my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try out softball
<caps> and my <caps> ran outside to wait for <caps> and that was a time that i was patient
when having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time
it has exactly <num> since <caps> father has had job
these are the problems the builders faced
and i waited a few weeks for my uncle to give me my money but he did not
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
the pebbles that he found helps him out
censorship in a library there are a plethora of books to choose from
the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
there will be less interacting time a risk by going on a computer
you can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone
<caps> good answer though
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
patience is essential when interacting with others
shaped just like a real bean and had handles on both sides
you can also talk to your friends on those websites to
first thing i did in line was to try to talk the people because i knew i would be in line for a while
we watched as the boys ran as fast as <caps> could to the field to get their daily game of football started
please read on to hear my story
sitting there in silence and feeling helpless i put my head down on my desk and started to cry
safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the <person> used hydrogen that was highly flammable
the library is open to any and or everybody
this would cause the dirigible to swivel around and around the mooring mast that was neither practical nor safe
the features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways
then we finally went to the store and i got the toy that i wanted
offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person <month> not be offensive to another person
the plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test
the only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that
so my dad and i were fine with the line for the <caps>
while doing this he and saves my parents money
so they stay in business
the <caps> states how he will always be grateful for what his parents did for him
the beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now
when ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read <caps> a days
i feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though i would not like to read any longer
thank you for taking your time reading this and i hope you do agree with me
computers are a great way to get uptodate information about the world
i was patient when i was going to cedar point
i was so glad i was patient for this story
after a while of just sitting i got going again
some features of the setting affected the cyclist
my best friends parents had been the same way with her
if people want to view those kind of things that other people find offensive they should buy them on their own time
when he got home he told <caps> mom and she said that she was happy because he was finally patient
this brought mass attention to <location> which caused many people to donate and needed items
this quote shows how he was given love by his family and friends through these celebrations
here is what i believe we should do
the <caps> of the empire state building faced many obstacles
people who stare on computers nonstop can make them not exercise
that means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left
books are a very important part of most peoples daily lives
library materials must be checked
computers are rumored also to be too time consuming and unhealthy for a person
although most people stay on for long periods of time but they cant stay on all day without say hi to family and talking to them
first having something this big land on a <num> foot building would add lots of stress to the buildings frame
research is the key to answering questions
you were infinitely beautiful in my eyes
i believe that this incredible ability of hers was one of the reasons that the summers i spend with her are some of <date> happiest memories
one time when i was patient and had to wait for it when it was time it felt good
he talked about the differences of a home and house
the author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water
i said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things
people believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it
many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the empire state building
but its like i said everyone has their own opinion
this was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways
a computer gives you any learn something
not only can i seek help from others on my computer but i can stay in touch with my friends and family
he searched and searched for her but found nothing
this put the dirigibles at risk of hitting that building or another
my family and i go to <caps> point a lot
maybe a library will come across my article and do what i have said
these observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers
it is true that that its pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers
should be removed from the shelves
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there
they are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph
the setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist
that talk about slavery and every thing els thats bad
<caps> people would die if this happened over a highly populated area
computers have a positive effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit this <date>
she just twirls around <caps> rushes over to them
it hurts your ears and gives you a headache
not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing
many people cant be patient
its very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day
if you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve
i say we spread the good word about computers and let every one know how awesome they are
the mood created by the author in this memoir is over all warm
that is why <caps> is easier to send messages to your boss
that <num> out of <num> member of <caps> family learn thing from the computer
he only says the good things about them
one day it was a cool new game that came out
we went past our hay barn and down a gravel road
he did not get it back until the glass was empty
they usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely
get off that computer it is <time>
you can also look for information on videos
my second reason is that people go on <caps> or <caps> or use web cams
i feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable
another great things about computers is that there are programs that allow you to talk to other people
we were now off on our way to go to our camping site
we later went to were truck was to get our belongings
in turn that would make me happy which is important
to us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next
they help us when we need something or have to do a report
an hour went by and we were still waiting
that went till about <num> it was amazing
every once in a while i would have to move a little because i could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings
when the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid
all they worry about is winning the game
so try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life
this basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it
a second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places
these amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation
i feel that if you are at the appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it
i learned to do something else while waiting
thank <caps> the doctor calls my name <caps> <caps>
in the memoir many moods were expressed
this is hurting people as well as the wildlife around them
<caps> the person saying that the person is not going to get off the computer
we all ready had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting
maybe its just the life of a typical teen and her <caps>
these are the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had faced
but on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended
some of the stories were so funny we tried not to wake everyone up with our laughter
another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas
the dirigibles would then be dangling high above pedestrians in the street
money was one of the big issues the builders faced
if anything happened to him there is no one to help
it could scar them mentally for life
he knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert
the empire state buildings steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand to weight of the mast
after i caught that fish i said its time for a break time
the author created a mood of happiness and love
when we found him we asked for bolt cutters
pretty soon <caps> kind as a human will become all together through the <caps>
the cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat
in paragraph two the cyclist describes how i enjoyed the serenity of an earlysummer evening the
this websites help take your mind off a bad day
then when you have a computer for someone else has one then you would be able to see them
it <month> help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of
every library has tons of information on just about everything
it took a long time for them to ship it but we got it
its their own personal thoughts and feelings and most of all its their story
time limits can fix this problem
a recent poll was taken and over <percent> of people who use their computers for more than <num> hours a day have gotten glasses
also its a great way to keep in touch with friends
then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and failed her test
it could change does lifestyle dramatically
this could be very dangerous
they be helpful but more hazardous
we had a lack of trust and i just wanted to tell him he was wrong
we tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in <caps> <caps>
computers hurt society more than it helps
it gives them time to grow up themselves
having patients can be a good thing
that is the mood that <person> showed in his memoir of his family
people needs computers to look for a job
many dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen instead of helium
its the first day of high school and your gut is full of butterflies that make you want to run to the bathrooms and hide from the world
at the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves
laughter is a part of my life
she was <caps> neat and clean that she got promoted
make the change today
the libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines
the last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
this has effected people because it is a faster ans easier way to write
we were in the quarter of a mile range in the line
i grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her
as a matter of fact i barely read but when i do start reading i sometimes am eager to keep on reading
there is a lot of people who take a long time to catch on
i think it should be one or the other
the information then they like how
all of them contributed to his life
but with email they would get it the second you send it
thank you for the time to read my letter
it seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat
the technological breakthrough of the <date> known as computers allow interaction with other people as well as learn of distant lands
the key for a long road trip is to be patient
we would spend a couple days or a week there
the top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area
when they got to the hotel patience mom had to get the room key get to their room unpack and get dressed to go
a test run with the u
also the computer is available all the time
i wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go so i waited on her
when i make mistakes or i upset <caps> she is patient most of the time
another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things
most people now think this is very racist
i think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life
it was pretty hard to go up my house stairs
thus concluding a few of many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the empire state building
my teacher apologized for the mixup and for it taking so long for it to come
especially now that <organization> has moved away
when you talk on the phone to someone it costs you money
i am at the front of the line and all of a sudden a group of people come up
people build their character through their reactions of how people treat them
the builders of the empire state building faced <caps> obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock
then in school i have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over
he jumped up and placed his hind legs on <person> chest
looking up i see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction
we have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are
i looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around
the obstacles were just to great to overcome
and thats my story being patient
they are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe
i think being on the computer is unhealthy
if the book is thrown away no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away
being patient has a reward at the end
i did then her god kids came over
i think computers definitely have a positive affect on people in many ways
after my mom finished her test she came out the room
when i woke up <caps> was <caps> started crying
there was a big snake in the road
experts should not try to have less people on the computer
i cant stand not having something
people will find out by themselves what they want to hear or listen too
you can even talk with your family through the computers and you wont spend that much money on expensive international phone calls
we are letting the children of <caps> grow up to fast and introducing them to things way to early
i own a very good map
formed the backdrop to life in our warm home
they can help with anything
not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the <location> armed forces
in school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer
so no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read
i hope you listened to my opinion on computers and i also hope you continue to tell people how great and important computers are
these people are very wrong
so the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him
so if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with
education is very important even for adults and children
<caps> is one of the moods because all every one in the neighbor hood got along
they use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again
its funner with people who are laughing with you or make you laugh
in the story she says then i will take the test again
next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches rolling hills which are more difficult to bike on
when we found the girls across the hall all except one of them were there
therefore computers are good
after experience i learned that being patient pay off
there were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible so this was a very dangerous obstacle
<person> is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them
then i went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile
it <month> make the person feel emotions that bring them down
this could a leading of obesity
as minutes passed <person> has to go to the bathroom
is when i want something really bad
computers are a quick and easy way to look up information for a school project or paper
some people think computers are bad because some people spend too much time on their computers
its been that way ever since
the old man helped us open one of the car doors
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents
not being with the people you love not doing any activities you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life for
the first <caps> the <caps> encountered was the wind
she refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast
the computer teaches you things for life
to me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments
our flight left at <time> am so we were there at <num>
we made some really good trails up there
it wont even phase anyone anymore
a few days went by as i continued <caps> silent observation of the duelists
if they took the chance and something went wrong innocent people could die
if you here a song once and then you just take it a wrong way u never let your mind here what they said
one problem would be the foundation
i hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society
you just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere
that morning <person> just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters
the builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
we got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room
we all were hanging out all day when <person> came up with an idea
he was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills
thats not all the computer has to offer
some people agrees that it benefit the society and others disagree
use hydrogen which is highly flammable
and it <caps> what his parents did for there children <caps> that they could have a better life in a new country
children learn mature information sooner than they should in <date> society
this was when i realized i met someone special
she was bouncing up and down at least <num> or three inches into the <caps>
our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced
i woke up in the <time> feeling all hipped up and ready <caps> rock
for example she was saying that she will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
its not like chewing a piece of gum
this is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor
learning about cultures is very important because if people travel they need to know how they can respect each other
but computers are being used for other things
this had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible
computers have great positive effects for everyone
the practical obstacle the builders faced was by law
when i get to use the computer to keep in touch with them
businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as <caps>
with laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime
i could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you
little did we no that it was <date> and the bathrooms where closed for the workers to come in and clean
nobody spends so much time on the computer that they cant go outside or hang out with there friends
and what i mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there to
so in the <date> game of the season i got in four times
all i could see was her red hair covering her face
most of then will help you learn about the subject and then you have time to finish it and hang out with your friends
there was another room we had to go through to get to the ride
people have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends
people should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day
you could be helping your family or friends out but instead playing computer games
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way
even now the shoes i was wearing are stained
all the information you could need
without a computer in my opinion things would be a lot more stressful
i think that reading books is a very positive thing
there should not be any style of censorship in the <location>
we were all looking out the window
i nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier
if you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it
therefore with people all over the streets in <caps> this was neither possibly or safe
now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life
we did exactly that we tried and we won that second set
we choose that life style for our children so we cant really blame the music and the movies
aside from that computers make life easier
many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the empire state building
the books that interest me the most are fiction books
think about a gun battle scene of a movie or a death in a book
the owner of the store let me get a total of <num> things for free
in my experiences laughter comes at the best of times
one problem was nature itself
another major problem they faced was safety
i learned a lot about <person> threw this project
me and myself swinging alone
i can be in the worst of moods and she can brighten my whole day with <caps> a couple of words
while us ladies changed into our bathing suits
i had been working everyday in the <date>
so now lets see what you think
the heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster
but i think as much i did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall
hope was <caps> because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family
<caps> more and more people are going to become like
this would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is
slowly i was beginning to fall asleep on top of a suitcase
by the time your twentythree you laugh with your friends because your friend is drunk and doing something stupid in the middle of the party
one reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable
the mood created by the author is described in many ways
i sure got a reply just not the one i was wanting
sometimes i feel like shes just my sister instead of my cousin
its a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great
i talked to her that day
she told me she would be only a few minutes
we must have been there <num> minutes waiting
people need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time
in other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test
as a kid we look up to our parents
i for one believe that computer are useful for many things
a place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book
his back aimed strait at the water
this feeling is without words
by family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another
make new friends when your at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park
my third and final reason is that when people use the computer there
they can find out where you live and when no one is home or when you are home alone
computers are keeping people from spending time together
see every day a have to tolerate people who up to the bathroom when need to go i have to wait <caps> i start to get hungry
i have had a select few instances throughout my life where i have read a book or magazine that to some <month> seem offensive and to others not at all
he is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared
when you trust a friend you depend on them to keep things between each other
the concluding paragraph to the story winter hibiscus gives a sense of hope for the future
<caps> can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood
my <caps> is more like a cackle mixed with giggling
one huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation
plus you can find a safe home with it
i started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part
i was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle
also you can talk with friends and family on computers
<caps> was going to be a rather warm day today so i put on some basketball shorts and a tshirt
if i do not feel like i can joke around and laugh with the people that i am with i usually do not feel like i can be myself
<caps> is so proud that his parents were so selfless and put everything on the line so that their future would be better
i had to find a lot of info so that also means a lot of books and a lot of reading
they should be in the other room to where you have to have like a id to get in
a book on <caps> could offend many people
we have libraries for the sole purpose of variety what is the point in having a library if you cant find what you want because it has offended someone
this can work to people away from screens and the <organization> course
the can not replace the real outdoors
the next day was not as hard
<caps> grabs the third one and uses it to block the fourth one
censorship can be considered as a major problem
i think there should be no books taken off the shelfs
see your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you
i felt so happy and belonged and it let me forget all the fear and doubt for a few seconds
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles
this reason is because use to it being quiet in libraries and not full with kids and teens
libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material
this would be pretty much anytime i am with my boyfriend
this set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as <caps> and <caps> and <caps>
you can become obese for <num> reasons
and i got two of them
i was at the begging at the line and then i saw a sign that <caps> two hour wait from that point
these are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places
the desert that he was in
scientist did a study on how people communicate
during the <date> you can go to the beach with your friends
you could say it made us closer
the builders had a real hard time with this construction of the morning mast
authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending
my brother had to ware a thing on his leg that sucked the fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster
if theres no phone then theres always the computer
i can make a connection because i have both a <caps> and <caps> that i use to stay in contact with family friends from all over
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i found an example to show that he was thirsty
computers can be used for many different things
a computer is to talk to someone without physically being there
a comedians job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them
this problem leads to the main problem because if parents say time to get off
now if you still think that is being offensive towards you or other people then thats alright
they are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family
one of the girls picked up the football
it shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much
he mentions a lot that his parents would let friends and <caps> come eat at dinner table for because they would help the authors family in the long run
my best gal friend and i were expecting these three boys to join us all week
the driver ad teacher says
the winds at the top of the building would constantly shift due to harsh and violent air currents and the back of the ship would constantly swing around
something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued
the <caps> for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together
many have it for entertainment purposes
one obstacle was the winds
the hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker
books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them
people like reading about sports because it is interesting to read
we cut the dough and put them into the oven
not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future
now people can get on the <caps>
he would try to do every trick in the book and then some
but when i was done i felt really good and quiet for everyone else
if thats not the case you can meet new people
it was also not possible to have dirigibles to land on the empire state building because the hydrogen and the dirigibles would be a safety hazard
no need to go anywhere to work
he also explains about his family and what they meant to him
another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law
he thought he was let down
a time i was patient was in <date> at the <organization>
we are teenagers and you were once a teenager
that day i was getting picked up early
they can help you do a lot of things that others <month> not
but nobody had even thought of quitting
the rough road was also a problem for the cyclist
the main obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face were mainly safety and nature itself
before we got on we had to pay a <money> each
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way
it helps kids fit in
just the other day i was in the library
this supports the mood of the memoir because the author is grateful to his parents for teaching him what a home really is
i was trying to find a book to read for an essay i had to write
take for example your newspaper
people can hack into almost everything
only the occasional laugh with my friends who live locally could cause me to forget the disappointment i had from missing one of my greatest friends
i think it should be allowed because its for everyone
i was more than happy <caps> oblige seeing as i love hiking
the computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people
it is all caused by what they see or hear around them
they will see it eventually
a simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright
this is exactly the way i felt in that moment
workers even use it to see whats going on with the jobs if theres any jobs open so they can take it
in the mooring mast by <organization> many problems with the mast of the empire state building are explained
<caps> is for these reasons that computers improve handeye coordination and other skills
this way no one will know that they read it
all sorts of people go to the library
people under <num> should also be restrained from looking through these materials
another setting i feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path
which of course <person> never knew about all that
the call or email was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state
not yet i replied with a mischievous grin on my face
at the end of sixth period i seen her and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted
their were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
we were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport
another problem was added stress to the buildings foundation
the obstacles the builders went threw was using hydrogen which is flammable
in fact i truly believe it would make matters worse
it sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people
we boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds
i know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit
a word is simply a word
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
basically we have rights to hear and read those things
this explains they had gotten a law after this from happening so they cant have things near the urban areas
lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving
this means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering
we even got <caps> to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach
and thats as far as i got
for example most local newspaper have a website that you can visit
also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke
i so proud of myself on how i was tolerant
as the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced made it hard to build the mooring
if they do not like it then they should have never taken it home in the first place
many libraries in the world <month> have censoring on their materials
each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in
there was no way i was going home
young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds
that are really bad for our mind
they stitched him up for three hours
certain materials should not be view by younger children
a short walk will bring us to a trail
i hope you see what i see now
you use computers to edit and put together your paper before printing
it was in the <date> but i cant remember the exact date
the setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride
these are the greatest moments
with having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst
the <caps> <caps> trip i just woke up when i herd a laughing sorta noise from down stairs
the computer is necessary for our society today
some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road
there was also a preexisting law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas
students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home
this just make me want to say wow do you really want to be that upset about a book
the author states i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
but i know that everyday he looks down on me and thinks back to all of the good times that we had
we cannot deprive children of that
but other people consider laughter being a reason that distances two people from each other
if certain books are offensive should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether
then i would read a few pages and i would think it was pretty good
i took the shot and he buckled and the <num> minutes i waited to find him felt like in life time
not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them
some <month> see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger
<caps> been proven that <percent> of information found on <caps> is true
i have seen a countless number of movies and listen to a countless number of songs that were offensive
just going out far which or even going on a run can give you time with your loved ones
email messages send instantly to anywhere
something everyone does
but hopefully most of the time its something that we all can share
the first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the <location> were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium
people become overweight also
something in me told me it was possible
this will help in every day lives to to play catch with your son or to pick something up it is very important
the best part is that <caps> is free
it is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence
my oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and l kept talking with my friends
are we going to take those books out to
i was so thrilled when i was finally able to check out the book and read it
i was very happy and enjoyed my <date> because of my two cousins and the time we spend together
the crowd said softly
one of the main obstacles that occurred would be nature
the hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills
but all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful
computers can be used for all sorts of things
all books should remain on the shelves
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
a mooring mast was put on top of each building for more height
as we skated we noticed a man and a woman sharing a date together in a very small boat
one way to fix this would be to place lead weights on the back of the ship
some of our family or friends live in far away places so we use the computer to talk
i think it was freak luck we survived that day but some how we did
i look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things
<person> turned to face him and her smile disintegrated
they had small teeth but oh they hurt
all people have freedom of speech in the <location> and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive you are taking away that right
i think some people just get offended too easily
the main reason for this was safety
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming
keep laughing and have a fun in all you do
i would rather be having fun and getting nice freshair then sitting on the computer about to be sick
the second seed was <person> from <organization>
i was trying not to think about the contest
you could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to
so even know you can communicate with your friends
<percent> of all people found out about their job on a computer
thats how i learn if you use your patience on will to be able to do some safe
when he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared
<caps> woke to the sound or cheering
some other advantages of computers are the computers functions
this describes how he respects his parents so much for their sacrifice
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
later the architects that were building the mooring mast had discovered that their idea was not going to be fulfill
so i had a talk with her and we came to an understanding
first off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means
they will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
overall think computers have a positive effect on people
i do agree with you on one thing
we helped everyone else get all their things unpacked and set up so we could go on a ride
these words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes
setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone
then theirs the law where airships can <caps> low above urban areas
all genres of everything should be available to the <caps>
winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash to the mast
people can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree
there are many reasons that this should not be passed
its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me
thank you for your time in reading this letter
<caps> i was about ten my parents bought my siblings and i a puppy
i believe that almost <percent> of kid are on the computer <num> because they have nothing to <caps> or it is addicting
i found this upsetting because everyone deserves to have access to the books that they want
considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast
just adding the mast would never work
better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk
i gave up trying and decided to get more involved in school and achieve good grades
i was very excited to go on that ride
i had a silly grin on my face
during the walk around the <caps> we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random questions that the other person had to answer
everyone except <caps> saw it and busted out laughing at the memory of what had previously just happened
all authors have the right to say what they wish but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them
when we went to feed him <person> grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage
it is an important thing to think about
family would be closer together instead of spreading apart by computers
the winter and cold represent how she feels out of place and upset at not receiving her drivers license
my grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the <date>
my group was first to entertain and we had finally selected our volunteers and actors
during this time the cyclist starts loosing hope
since the blacktop was outrageously hot <person> started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away
offensive books should not be anywhere you are at
laughter reduces stress for both <person> and i
pleases near my reasons and give me a fighting chance
his environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty
lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes
<caps> found out in two days the new location will open up
at last it was my turn i walked out into the hall and found out i was on the <caps> team
most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast
he wants to try new things
as he was getting dressed other boys got out there first and took the ball
although the mast was finished due to <caps> nature a new law no dirigibles has ever docked at the empire state building
i think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going
the reason i was happy though is because i got to go onto the field
they never understood what they wrote they put it in full sentences
now i have no cast on
the invention of the mass on top of the empire state building was an undeveloped idea that created created a new means of transportation but arrive with numerous flaws
people that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse
the <caps> of this story is that happiness can be created and kept in one place
the winter hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before
the builders also needed to considered the violent winds at such a high altitude
i think the future will be based everything on computers
the apparent mood in this story was love and the family had much of it
i pulled down the safety bar
in a survey taken in a local magazine <caps> should that <percent> of people are on computer and
are all great shows for kids
the first reason i thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there
one of them will be about exercising
it wont happen to everyone but they need to know these things
this made the masts installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas
its easy and free way to talk to anyone you know whenever you want
many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist
i play it with my mom every time
lastly they help people become less stressed by playing computers games
i honestly can not remember the last time i heard him laugh
computers also help with instructions on how to make things
the author creates a grateful mood
after that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire
the momma bird got upset
<person> noticed that <person> loved to laugh a lot
there are many sites to chat with friends
we met when i was on vacation at <caps>
they even ship your item fast
the geese always come back when the seasons change
one day i decided to go over to my friend <person> house
this was the mood created by the author in the memoir
<caps> was silent because they were getting irritable
<caps> it is not the only one
the library would be pointless
some of them being across the ocean in <location>
i said sorry and then we played catch
for one its more respectful and for two everyone can have their own thought about something
should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
i recently visited <location> and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them
its not something you learn over the years
many features of the setting affected the cyclist in rough road ahead
what there reading should <caps> have any effect on others unless they are reading <caps> also
thats not right to let them see things like that
the reason its happy is if you hear the tone how shes telling us
the coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth
you even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded
we did what they told us to do
i just wish that there was a world <caps> could just run away to with out anyone knowing where its at in the world
the author explains that the wind on top of the buildings are dangerous for the dirigible
finally they spend less and less time with their family and being active
we wanted to get his mind off of his mother
so censoring these would in turn censor one voice and emotions
it said which advanced classes i would be in
this represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on
he then goes on his bike to the park taking their shortcut
he when i asked why he told me
they help you write reports or reports in general for any subject
when she gets the chance
that is how the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist
books come in all different genres and so do music and movies
of course <person> got up before everyone
time seemed to go by so slow i was <num> years old before my grand parents left
i want to state a opinion on how computer effects people
they have sacrificed so much for their children including social and financial sacrifices
<caps> <caps> <caps> the <caps> <caps> in the <caps> of <caps> <caps>
many obstacles took place while builders of the empire state building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there
one of the first problems they faced was safety
there are some rare situations when restrictions <month> need to be upheld but merely based on age
and i hope to <caps> that you start living it healthier
his surroundings led him to the state of dehydration
some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but i disagree
then watching him try to climb down again
when we got to <caps> we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up in <location> the other side of where we were supposed to be
you can live your entire life indoors
this shows that their family was very inviting
i have to disagree though
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
so we just asked for our bill
and you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive
even if they were able to get around all these obstacles there is a law against airships flying to low over the city
<person> on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor
when i was little i went to the mall with my grandmother
it might just start a revolution
<caps> just make things more complicated anyway
you just started the story and it is due tomorrow
well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes
a law the dirigibles were unable to dock on urban areas in case of a problem within the dirigibles
<caps> is always positive and happiness follows is in life
this just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other
we started walking down the road after we got to the end of are drive way
the two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring
i just think the memoir sets a happy mood
offensive material in libraries is <caps> directed to be read by young children
hydrogen gas is highly flammable
generally most libraries are quite large and organized into various sections throughout the building
on a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends
it turns out that i used to be one of those people myself
the whole camping trip i was patient
this is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling
turn off the television if the program bothers you
there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
about four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers
allowing a dirigible land and on the empire state building would be dangerous
but we were siting there for about <num> hours
the other pair of brothers were next
<person> was being question about his birth certificate
the plane had just finished refueling and we were on the way to the runway
she just went on with her day
the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a <caps> party
woman have the same rights as <caps> do
sometimes people say stuff and the person reading it can take it a whole different way
dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise
one way he did this is by thanking his parents for passing on their culinary skills to him
<caps> are <percent> of children who are addicted to computers
i hope my three reason can persuade the local news paper to agree with my position that computer have a positive effect on people
people what there for one hour and will blow up
i know manages thats because <caps> becoming more mature and i have a lot of patience
this quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle
computers are <caps> morphing devices that take away <caps> points in life
about ten minutes after they left my cousin <person> turns to me and says you want to do something really fun
people who use computers often spend less time exercising
that law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
that is what i would do
suddenly i could not help my self
everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing
<caps> mom was ready to explode
just the mere smell of his mothers cooking brought love to the entire room
back then i had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio
i have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth
it not much of a story
this cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing
somebody is always going to get hurt
they give people a chance to learn things
sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think were laughing at them when were really not
i just cant do this long distance thing anymore said <person>
the wait for that was <num> minutes
<caps> first reason that computer have a positive effect on people
so <caps> so much easier to log on <caps> and have a private conversation with her rather than driving a day and a half or flying for three hours
then why should that person be punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something
the first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers
thats when i felt a rain drop pound down on <caps> head
if an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid
the mood for his story is bittersweet
safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor
instead of typing away we should explore the world and learn important things
when we are hanging out it seems that we effortlessly humor not only ourselves but others even the complete stranger
this setting greatly affects the mans journey
good thing that he is taking water or who knows if he would of survived or not
it flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the court
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
i know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored
it felt like i waited for nothing
we kept on walking and saw a group of gypsies dancing on stage
it is the people around you causing the offensive news
what first appeared to be a worthwhile and realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed
the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful
not being able to see a real relationship
if one <caps> was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society
if the wind blew to hard it could swing it back into the building
i got out of the river and ran to <caps>
the next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water
my friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns
everyone should have a computer in there home today
i paid nineteen dollars for it
or how they see the actors in the movie and they curse and they think is cool cause there doing it as well
it helps us build handeye coordination
it will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them
the architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium
growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression
the road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on
the computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous
that <month> or <month> not have happened to me
i am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good
computers have helped advance medicine as well
racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today
they can have live video chats together
before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends
therefore it was desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear that gave airplanes the title of transportation of the future
laughter can save us
your slow you might <caps> <caps> still i laughed and hung up and went in said and we all laughed
<caps> helped the world to change in better way
i will admit i too use my computer quite a bit but at least i budget my time so i can also go outside and play a while
<caps> movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive
in the excerpt the <caps> were faced with multiple issues on their theory
you go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them
these are just two methods of <caps> that the computer enables us to have
therefore doing this would be illegal
but there was a child in my class who had never seen a <caps> in her life
come on did this change your mind yet now
i thought i was going to die but my mom said to be patient
it is everyones own choice to read a book or listen to a <location>
i think that all books should be aloud to stay on the shelf
in do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does
all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
<caps> had very fortunate times in his eyes
being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel
<caps> would argue that it was the greatest invention ever
<caps> you can get it this time
<caps> first reason is that computers help people educate others
it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there
censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose
i simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain
he dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state
this led them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded
many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying
a shill scream escaped my lips and i bolted for door before she could unleash her wrath upon me
and not be working down at you finger keys
it should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate
<caps> <caps> walked in <person> i know this is hard for you but you can send him letters
nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world
to get things off my mind we decided to eat
it was then that i had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting
the winds around the building were constantly shifting because of the location of the building
i bot a jackass shirt and some food
i gave her a candy that just only shut her up for a couple of minutes
my opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes
i was the only student in our grade that knew that answer
all of these examples would cause the builders to face obstacles
so i waited an hour and a half to use the phone
we drove <caps> the mountain and at the base there were around <num> <caps> <num> people all in hiking gear
the only good part of the line was the shade
the mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness
it allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than <num> seconds
our ability to start laughing at one another helped her throughout this time
then we got off that plane we went to go find the next one
the only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and <num> other <caps> i barely knew gossiping quietly
its like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment
the conclusion for the story is a nice ending
some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors
along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory
i would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded
computers are the greatest tool mankind has
instead go to a book store and buy whatever you need there
many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the empire state buildings blimp dock
this is a time when i was patient
the mood of the memoir is gracious
reading is a way of learning
unless its racist or sexist no one has any right at all to say something cant belong
<caps> could use it for <caps> related <caps>
was my dad was going to sent me a <caps> present
music should not be censored
i looked out the window and sighed
something that would be offensive to you could very well be beautiful to someone else
this affected the cyclist because he had to pedal harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this
so he ends up running out of water
he is now a fashion designer
everybody were back to normal and everybody had smile on their faces and even the little kids everybody got their pizza really fast
the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot
i began to realize i was digging deep into shallow waters
this shows the old man could be wrong and places can change
the gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information
friends are a big part of my life and i love just to talk to them and see how they are doing
one day when i was younger just starting to read i came across a book
that was the mood created by the author
but because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse
the use of this technology can old people in discovering so many new things they have never known before
the water was very hot and tasted very nasty
dirigibles could not land at the empire state building because there were too many dangers
she would teach the lesson and than have to reteach it before to living questions
computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society
another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored
i think they should have to show i
my patience was not very good
my friends and i that day had decided to go to <location> <caps>
you see that you can trust more people to when you get to know them
also it does not matter to me if i have to pay for the things that i check out from the library
it gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in
our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect
most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader
he could suffer from heat exhaustion
a library is a place of education and learning
i sometimes have to patient at school with <caps> and other students
computers also do the same thing for music
my first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others
we wore green everyday and peace signs on as many clothing we were able to get on our tiny little bodies
the setting were hot and dry
although technology is used in everyday life from communication to searching for information it can slowly us the human race down
<caps> one is based in <location> with <caps> training to be a hero
but i do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and there children are reading it
a computer has made the life of a school student so much easier
it is as simple as that
as it would only make sense to try to keep the peace
first thing they encounter is ghost town
computers are not family there are not going to make you exercise there going to make you lazy
people just have to learn how to not use foul language when not needed
these are the few moods created by the author in the memoir
as soon as i got here i charged towards the computer to see did was still available
the stress might be so much for the building that it could cause the building to collapse
the architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the pacific ocean
thank you for your time
my dad goes to a special doctor
social activity is good for everyone
this book was a fictional story taking place during the <location> <caps>
the sign said <num> minutes wait
you have the freedom to pick out the book
it was the first day of my junior year
then he cycled along the desert which was very hot
so after i talked to her some more
i waited and waited but nothing showed up
this is why i think that people are spending ton much time on computers
i believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do
she has set a goal to accept it
these imposing obstacles made the use of the empire state building is a dock unrealistic
my first reason why we should keep computers is because it <month> help on school homework or projects
the <caps> of laughter many people think it is love that brings people together
i can remember my friend telling me that she always types her essays because its for her teacher and from typing
they had to find new jobs and give their child a happy life
and he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear
by far many obstacles got in the way of the process of the mast
some were as long as one thousand feet in length
or your daughter from looking at porn
computers are taking over our life
more and more people using computer is a good thing
i wont stop laughing for a while
talking to in country is unbelievable
these are all things adults and kids need a like to do
eventually he did came back
but other people have no patient at all
laughter is the best way to relax and here is three reason for that
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she says then i will take that test again she believes in the flowers
time went by and we became good friends
<caps> this he smiled and began to tickle me like he always did ever since i was little
i think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time
leading experts from the <caps>
here is a story when i was very patient
not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area
this shows how friendly and inviting the were
so many people rely on technology to get through there life
in any relationship you have or are in laughter is a major thing you need in a relationship
the night came to an end when <caps> ended up dumping her water all over the waiters son
and the worst when your not
i think <caps> was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me
well in this letter i am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society
he always has been the one who can always turn my frown upside down
<caps> had medicine <caps> all <caps> i think the best <caps> took was three nights ago when i was with her in her room
now around <num> years have passed and this memory is still with me but i only get the best of it
two years ago there was a boy named <person>
the mood created by the author is loving and happy for many reasons
one time i was patient was i went to the doctors office
he started out before the sun could to him
he used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth
some libraries have begun to censor their book selection by removing ones they thought could be offensive
thats because they use hydrogen rather than helium
i was even more comforted by knowing that i could see my friends everyday
go to a social website and strike up a conversation
this proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out
i laughed for about ten minutes and said that i accepted his apology
the design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the mood that the author shows is happiness and love
this law made it illegal for them to tie it up to the building or even approach it
all you do is type a subject to <caps>
stores wont let kids under the age of <num> buy a rated <caps> movie
the only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines
these days children learn about things sooner and sooner
it had been three years since i last seen them
a good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy
how could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation
he loves cooking and his parents taught him how to cook
social skills are the difference between success and failure
<person> finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them
people have to write their work on a piece of paper
in my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution
the mooring mast of the empire state building was never fulfilled
censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems
id rather read a book that interests me than a book that i dislike
thats because laughter and fun go hand in hand
one of the good reasons about computers was that you can chats with other people around the world
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
when she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country
boy was <person> a goof
its all a matter of opinion
using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening
not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
it was <date> when my family and i went to cedar point
the workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast
it could be twice a year or more a month or whatever is picked as long as there is one day <location> or even more than <location> can exercise on
but his mom kept saying <caps>
there are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school
see these <month> things you can go on the computer
for instance <organization> is a way to see your friends like that
a single tear weaved its way down my face
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the buildings or even approach the area
children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child
you can talk to friends
every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas
the construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building
the last example is <caps> do libraries let kids take them home and read them
who knows what would have happened if the panicked <caps> would have made it to the beach all by himself
<caps> stepsister had recently gotten a new car so <caps> <caps> <caps> stepdad were outside looking at it
before we did anything at <caps> i first found a restroom and we were later all in agreement that we should get something to eat
i think that this would be fair for everyone
i begin to walk toward him again very slowly
another obstacle was safety
i always wished that i could go back in time and relive <caps> childhood
i assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat
and then there is the content of what you are viewing
to give their children a better life
i was about nine years old and it was the week of <date>
so i think next time shell do great
this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels
people spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted
when will they be here i say
people were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the <location>
and lastly do you want your <caps> put in danger by simply just using a <caps> at home
or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer
some of these books have historical meanings behind them
i am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient
he went skiing up at his family cottage
people can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or <caps>
also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic
he was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally
it is not unhealthy or time consuming unless you are allowing your computer usage to be that
say a child around the age of <num> is listening to the new <caps> <person> song
but technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people
another obstacle the use of hydrogen rather than helium in foreign dirigibles
i made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over
books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race
i always feel like the happiest girl in the world
society is a whole lot different then when parents were kids
the road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills
it <caps> help you find in the computer about people
that is how the different settings effected the cyclist
this is why you need to spend less time on the computer
if something was to happen to it i would be destroyed
i told him that was going to catch a turtle and that was final
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i wont focus on that i m going to focus on this topic
this issue is debatable but really i think that computers are not helping the big picture
even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them
also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high
all of these culture came together in solidarity and friendship
patient means that you are understanding and tolerant
an initial problem was faced during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building
but the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire state building
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important
the girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there
also how there was always music that was like an endless celebration
this would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event
so i took action and cleaned our lakes
hydrogen is highly flammable
coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man
the mood in this memoir is one of gratitude
many would say its a book without cuss words or its a movie without racism
no matter if books are real or fake they create stories that interest people
i am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people
it would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read
that is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis
the desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere
with this the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened costing <money> just to change the framework
people ignore their parents when on computer
it also is to show she is adapting to her new home
it also helps in sports
soon i will once again have patience when i tutor for <caps>
my mom is very patient
computers can have benefit society
that is until something very unexpected happened
the law against airships were they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas
but one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future
even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems
as you can tell it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for <num> hours
handeye coordination very important
it also lets people interact with others in a different way
he cared about our future and pushed us to strive in every moment of life
the puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair
<caps> mom almost fell asleep i was just standing there waiting
computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends
this is my opinion expressed in words about how i feel about the whole topic
my boyfriend is my life
everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do
an if you rush them they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
i was so amazed with how much patience she had
<caps> is the biggest <organization> fan known to man
most of the time that is bad because kidnappers lie about their information so that you can meet up with them and then they take you away
i agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers as well as most things in the world we live in
under support for happy is like <caps> wanted nothing more
we were so excited and happy
so we were deciding which roller coaster to go on
for the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it
we kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over
<caps> you are always sitting at the computer desk then you might be like that
some people have even removed the <caps> from local library systems
during the <date> dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future
then another hour passes
most magazines have the same principles as movies do
i believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library
and its something that would have to be done
the kitchen was the very heart of the home to the author
after talking about it for a while i concluded that i got so upset because she did it in front of our friend
i knew no one but her so i felt out of place
this <caps> not the way to be treating a device
computers do many things for us
the success of the mooring mast of the empire state building was prevented by many obstacles
people know what they want
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
my friend <person> spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside
adults and children are becoming smarter each day
another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming
using the computer is like smoking
i always whine and complain
i do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down
the narrator has gone through recently many but in the seasons
i was patience the whole entire
i love my family and even today we look back on this and laugh
the features of the setting effected the cyclist
dear <caps> <caps> i think that computer have bad effects on people
where it starts to add up
let these young adults read about everything they are interested in
our laughter died down and we sat there in silence
one of the major obstacles was the stress to the buildings frame
it was a day that i felt closer to <location> and <person>
the mood of this memoir is grateful and content
my parents and i went to <location> for <caps>
if there is a need for things like this then have a special store for things like this
filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen
he feels that he is at home even though he moved to <location>
those computers can help us with anything
on one side there was a cave
books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people
they can express their feelings in a way that is amazing
that is how harmful words get changed into names and then the next thing peers are calling other peers that word
it makes me feel like i have done something good with my life that i was willing to help <person> with her struggles
the crowd soon began to realize what was going on
her mom always takes forever when she out doing things
the man felt so afraid of <caps> the lady he was talking to might think of him
they are helpful and fun you never run out of options with a computer at your side
which is a saying i have heard many of times
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting
<person> an i then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were
it makes the bond between you and others stronger
which i adored to this day another mood setting advantage is his family
over <money> of changes had to be made for this
i guess i just sort of lose my cool
so i made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel
for about <num> or <num> minutes or what felt about an hour my aunt came and picked me up
the boy grinned and said ill be right over there
people know whats going on in there and some others persons know too
we went on all of the rides
<caps> the story that is what is talked about
the computer can be really helpful and useful
in my opinion the citizens of <location> would want to keep it more clean and be more about their
the descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey
well that is my opinion on what i think should happen
i glanced over my shoulder and saw <person> running at me
if not the empire state building might fall over
the person who was giving out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule
theses are my reasons i think computers have a negative effect on people
i have my own state of mind and so do you
thus ending the idea to proceed
i told her to hang up because we had to clean
there are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the empire state building
that was a time i was patient
it <month> not be completely accurate
especially kids should be outside playing and exercising
laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words
then we took the <num> hour flight to hawk bay
i really had no idea what a <caps> was until i walked into that class
i have <organization> and i think that it is a wonderful resource
i listen to the radio station <num> sometimes and all the music is mostly about violence
so i waited and waited
computers benefit our society because they are like an electronic encyclopedia
another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas
people are not going to look at things the same
we had to drive the hole day then get a motel to stay in
the last reason why computers and laptops effect people is because of hacking
i sat down and patiently waited for my mom
i believe that computers are beneficial
the reason being on why i stopped being his friend was he to get mad if i come over there to ask if he can come outside
this is a story about a time when i was patient
and if they did it it would become illegal to the ship that pass tie up to the building or even approach the area
this is the same case with other populations of people
no one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries
whenever i went over to their house we played night and day
one of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
all kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day
computers are <caps> robots they do lots for us
all you need to do is type in vacation spots and click enter
people would take their business elsewhere
all of our free time was spent with one another
the <caps> created by the author of the memoir is warm and inviting
think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with
they believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter
but just then <caps> sister forgot her towel
but in the end i got to go home and play with my friend
the features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time
others spend it shopping or learning
you can drive a person crazy
my sister and her friend complained dragging their feet
<caps> they were wrong
theres an example on being patient
then i glance at the clock <num>
made their slave through ignorance
but you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world
its all about the environment they grew up around
both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today
that was the end of forts on the ground for us
sometimes when my sister is mad she just throws me in
that means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place
so if you would please under stand we got to read all of our parents favorite child hood books
soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things <person> should wish for with her birthday wish
it is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people
a patient person experiences without complaining
not just to him but to almost anybody
sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and i just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half
i never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is
laughter brings people together even on the worst days
sooner or later five pounds is gained
the setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one
there was this day not to long ago that i had to wait
they never gave up but instead kept going to try and give there children a better life than they would have had
it affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water
many people get offended in this word way to easy
finally the last reason why computers are bad is because they take away from your family life
a very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read
teens relieve a lot of stress on the web
all he does is play on the computer all day long
having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression
it was a <date> <time> and i needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else
my mom said as patient can
suddenly it had started pouring
there is no point in trying to hide the truth
because it shortens activity time
i had to beat <organization> at <num>
you can teach your kids all you want just make sure that it is the wright thing
this quote about forty miles in the pedal i arrived as my first town
some music might not be the best choice for a young child
but no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer
there it was <location>
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
in the <organization> we have the freedom of speech and press
this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them
removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge
which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter
<caps> is thankful for that and feels that <caps> is lucky to have such a close knit community of friends and family
we need to show them that we know what they doing
the store market is also run on computers
that day is like any old day
you can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling
so he had to do his homework so he told me to do my home work
i disagree with this statement
the dirigibles used outside of the united states used a gas they created a dangerous risk for accidents
sports can be just as enjoyable and helps build the human body and gives you the right amount of exercise that your body needs
or modern day without taking a step out of your house
then i calm <caps> back down
i hope you take them into consideration
those are some examples of why i think the author concluded the story with that paragraph
the memoir gets happier as the author describes in paragraph <num> how friendly and close the people living around him were
so the builders had many obstacles and attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
also you have to be a certain age to buy <caps> and games that are for the elderly teenagers
theres stuff thats bad like you cant really stop them
i found that horrible
computer very helpful when social life
you can share you want with people you barely see
based on the excerpt the builders of the empire state building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing
there was also the problem of winds
not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people
people have to think the library is open to children and elderly
obesity leads to many such as dogged arteries or strokes
passionate music witch he adores today
this creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly place due to the people gathering together
laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me <caps>
second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project a computer <caps> help
in life we defeat great obstacles but sometimes we cannot defeat the obstacles we face
laughter is the shortest distance between two people
and the other mood of the story is being grateful
i think computers are better than books and dictionary because you can do all that stuff on a computer
a quote that shows this is my parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family
patience can mean a lot of things
one reason was that he was in the desert
he told me i needed a long private lesson if i wanted to play my notes right
other problems the building faced had to do with safety
there are many different kinds of books in the library
in order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the <date> sun
if a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned
censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be
in paragraph <num> it says it was here i learned them real definition of family
so just talk to them and be real about things
you can meet new people from all around the world
it shows this in <caps> <num> throughout the whole thing
dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the empire state building
so read on i know you will think the same way as me about computers given my knowledge below
human beings do not always want to learn the same things
its a perfect way to stay in touch
communities have many different types of people that live in them
at first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location
the only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side
it is of home and family
the mood created in this memoir is very homebound
it was pretty awkward
they also say that they are not interacting with family and friends
they yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable
<caps> east to find friend and play a game with them
in this <caps> he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love
and the rocketshaped mast would have four wings at its corners
when we stepped inside we noticed that a flier said <num> shots <date> threw <date>
<caps> perhaps the greatest obstacle would be nature itself
after many tries was starting to get the hang of it
another reason as to why the mooring mast can not be constructed is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas
she made fish faces and sounds like she pretended to be a monkey in a tree
it will only further advance us as a society in the end
we were and always will be great friends
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents
the mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
this case is similar to the physical features of <caps> <caps>
so this is why i think computer are helpful but a waste of time
my mom said that i was really patient
all over the universe people <month> agree or disagree with what i have to say but its your perspective and what you think about it is your choice
i do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf
would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong
computers give us a way to communicate with long distance friends and family
they decided on going into the deserts of <location> to a huge lake to camp at
my second leads to my third
deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task
my third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world
this is my view on censorship in libraries
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelfthat work i abhorthen you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
and lastly they would add a couple of observation rooms to the <num> and 102 floors
this extremely reliable and accurate
also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy
my last example is that doctors sometimes say its not good for you to stay on the the computer
it had really paid off
there a lot of reason in which computers are bad
you could work at a restaurant that has regular food or fast food service
around lunch time while my mom and <person> were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch
these magazines and books could also be seen as informing
i tell her everything and she tells me everything
these are just some examples of moods created by the author in this memoir
all <caps> computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a <caps>
they were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine
they basically had to start over this pursuit to get good careers
dear local newspaper a lot more people uses computers daily but not everyone agrees that it benefits society
as i got off the bus i was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface
another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building
later that night i finally came out
the author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note
another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine
and they would always have they would always have people eat over and stay over if the needed to
they then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the buildings foundation
i have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference
it even mentions in the passage that hes grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
it would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians heads
the story has a lot of examples of how his family was so nice
<caps> smiles and decides not to follow
<caps> went up to the main desk and started complaining
you race back to the library only to find out that it is closed
then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
that is why i say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist
there are many reasons why i believe that computers benefit our society
one reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers
its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter
who knows we might have to vote on it someday
they can see the different types of drugs and learn about them
how would you feel if tons of your personal info got out into the public
it <caps> that his parents sacrificed for him
his timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar
life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products
so if everyone of it have a effect on if to turn off their computers they would spent more time with friend and family
but traffic <caps> holding you down because of a <num> car pile up
i got done with <caps> and the bell rang to tell us school was over
every place uses computers they are a big thing
the first obstacle they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building
being patient can mean all of these things
they sacrificed so much for him
also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds
mooring a dirigible to the top of it
first he says how grateful he is for the customs passed down to him
but getting back to what i was writing about so in <date> i asked my <caps>
this made me think of my parents immediately
it also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
since i have two computers and one laptop i have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer
one reason she <month> have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test
the law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas
these taught the main character how to love and how to care about someone
i believe that book should be kept in order of age
a time i was patient was when i was sitting at my house for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend
all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
when you use a computer to communicate you are also saving money
not exactly the kind of comment i was expecting
from all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout
my mom had to have patient when we were in traffic to get to the camping grounds
this would have been a major problem
it seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing
while i was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing
coming up on <caps> right came the book store and <caps> jitters became more uncontrollable
we should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt
<person> and i were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears
one of my examples of why i disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone
she showed me how to do the problem and i figured it out
the same with movies
if the winds were this rapid the back of the dirigible would be swinging around freely
i answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling
his wife loved it and he must have felt like she was still attached to it somehow
one would be the way passengers got one and off of dirigibles
we were coming up to the campground
the next day rose quickly and i trudged back to the disappointing classroom
books are so very important to us and our world
i believe that people should be able to go on computers for needed actions such as research
if someone took the time to make it then we all deserve the right to view it
one morning before we even started things were tense between people
so lets start to cut our usage time down now
eventually my friend <caps> put a whole bunch of <caps> <caps> into my favorite stuffed animal
but my dad said that well be trough soon and he told me for just watch the people on it go by and not talk
i learned a lesson from <time> of to always scope out the area first before you go through it
so the adder came in and gave me the brace got resettled in and left
these hills reduced his stamina greatly
they changed his hope to doubt
its pros how to better and more affective ways to healthy
i am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people
<person> is a very good person
since it was about <num> pm most of the good folk of <location> were sleeping or inside
i begin to thank him and ask if <caps> would like some hot chocolate or coffee
go lets recap on this paper
this leads to a downward spiral of our society
he talks about passing out and dieing
people should be aware of their world in which they live
laptops have made it easier to block people out
the back end would still swivel in the wind
everyone was constantly in a state of laughter from the stories of the shenanigans that my father and his brother and <caps> managed to get into
we were able to understand each other
my dad and i fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny
just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive
when i laugh i usually feel happy after wards en less i am crying because i am hurt
patient <caps> a very important trait that could lead to it own rewards
i reason that computers are more unhealthy for us
on the way there with <organization> clumsy feet trips over a piece of wood
<person> flipped the quad right over and got on it and drove back behind the <person>
it might not be good for the eyes of people
the little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us
my second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie
<caps> makes me frustrated
or you never know you could forever and never be found
i believe that it is unjust because the girl <month> not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project
it raises the spirits and lightens moods
they all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it
not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers
it hard for me to get them to calm down
it was too high firstly
there were obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
no package i thought to my self
<caps> we flew out the back door with our sleds
i feel really honored that i have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life
the setting he was in made him a little more wise
this time i stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that lead up to the top of the ridge
the teacher is standing right in the middle of it all
we named her vary patient
halfway through his journey the stated sometimes life can be so cruel
i person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like
its just like saying without a heart your body will still function
she wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain
if you ever miss a show to watched home of the show and watch it
even now they have somethings where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer
we need to learn about those kind of thing
i have and i have to say it was rewarding
if this was discussed a lot of time and money would have been saved
because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get away and relax the self at the library to read
people the ability is checkout on whats going on around the world or checking for the weather
i promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view
but you can <caps> get called crazy if you are laughing at nothing at all
then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
students <month> contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment
i always went with my two friends <person> and <person>
the world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone
everyone likes different things and has different views
that is the main reason for libraries
water simple was limiting and as he went farther and farther it seemed like thing would get worser and worser for him
later on the setting was against him
almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside
the author also says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice
people who support computer usage might say
most dirigibles <caps> using highly flammable gases such as hydrogen
through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones
one obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the empire state building was the use of hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the united states
this mood is portrayed in many ways
more than <percent> of <caps> are overweight and unhealthy
there are going to be a lot of jerks out there
this is an easy way to get around the system
censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today
no matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn
i was so bored i went outside for some fresh air
the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars
<person> asked as he climbed in next to <person>
thats all i have to say about censorship
this is because of others beliefs or nonbeliefs
this author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work <month> be recognized
one persons strong negative opinion effects everyone else
so if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway
they would start a conversation with you like they would ask you for your name and where you live
my dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while i was turning red and embarrassed
but i still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while
you can also talk to your friends and even video chat with them too
and if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and title to read and watch
the problem is winds on top of the building were constantly shifting violent air currents
it also make our work neater
being an <caps> citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down
sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it
race and origin are another problem with some people
its about time to move to the next reason
next thing you know me and <person> are side by side riding a dirt bike and a <caps> bike down the busiest road in town and its pitch black outside
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the making of the mast
it tells us what was happening in that part of the world
they way laughter has impacted my life is by giving me this amazing best friends who is crazy and humorous
there are a lot of examples that make me think that
patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure
i rock him and play with him
people get these ideas because of movies
thats stating the mood was very cultural
that the mood of the author in the memoir
when we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more
second way is i will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice
the passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible
you should know what your picking up
these part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect
he only speaks through sign language
to his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business
<caps> said in a very joyful voice
when she will look at it she will find the courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her test
<caps> started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground
kids and as adults have a big imagination that could sometimes hurt others as well as family members
now that you have finished reading
my parents came to pick us up in what my dad called an <caps> that looked like an ordinary school bus
and <caps> a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world
know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries
not in a very nice way but i got to play
parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea
the second most important mood was loving
the setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions
this was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water
ratings show whats appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twentyfive year old
children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher
we then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner
the slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship
fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught
some can even memorize the key board and not have to even look down
i actually cant even remember them
it is clear the setting has affected the cyclist
all we could do was get upset or just not say anything
so that made matters bad
most people who do i personally think are immature
but i disagree is many good effects computers can have on people
throughout the <caps> the author <caps> many moods to describe and fit what has happened in his memoir
he loves his parents and is happy with what they have done
their is no reason to give people access to material that could be offensive to other people
you could also watch music videos or funny videos to get you laughing
he tried for hours to make it go
many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids
you would forget to say hi and how are you to your family
there are <caps> websites that can help you find information
the <caps> proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also
they <month> also miss out on family dinners and movie night
the lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize
scientists say that <percent> or people that type for at least four years become better handeye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile
this shows how handeye and exercise is linked to computer
the librarians should convince the person that brought those in there and tell them to take them back where they got it from
i closed my <num> and took deep breathes
dirigible have never dock there and never will because it is unsafe
memories would be when we hung around with friends and family
and it seems that computers are addictive
read on to find interesting details about computers and their positive effect
another positive effect that computers have on people is communication
and the end of this passage says
eventually if you let yourself go and laugh you will feel closer to them
computers have become so advanced that there are even touchscreen and wireless mases
the author was affected in many ways be the conclusion
<caps> also explains how grateful <caps> was to his parents for their love and sacrifice
the way that her parents helped the community out shows their general love and kindness for all
another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought
i really feel like am on both sides
if stores take away these items that it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice
a third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
also it can be a representation of her life itself
over the next few months i waited patiently
its a positive ending
i was laughing like i had never laughed before
to me thats very unhealthy
the next morning was <date> so i had to go to school
the builders expectations were set too high and they faced many obstacles they had not foreseen
<caps> i was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested
so i just tried not to think about it
sometimes these things should not be on the shelves
i believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them
music should stay on the radio or in stores not in libraries
i knew that she was concerned for me
it contradicts freedom of the press
i hope this essay changed your mind about computers
they want there kids to learn about what they are reading
i can give you <num> good reasons why
her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good
the settings affect the cyclist in more than one way
there are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting
i just start laughing from that day on
i hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries
this is what my life felt like when the world turned around and i found out my best friend just flipped her car
when i was in middle school i always liked to read <person> and <person> books
<caps> continued a game of eye spy for <num> minutes or so as the line slowly progressed
<caps> felt like <caps> should look for the brighter side of the situation
i am always reminded of him when i hear a laugh
the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one
the mood created by the <caps> in this memoir is mostly grateful through the memoir
if it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up
it is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing
any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please
then the cyclist could carry on
people should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect
everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books
materials that are offensive for some people in my point of view should not be removed from the shelves
some people do read it and it is produced
who knows what you can learn
the memoir were changing all through the book
however one cant go through life without any friends so i quickly tried to conform to what was considered normal
i think computers have a positive effect on people because today you can do almost anything
laughing for me is a huge part of having fun in any relationship
there were several obstacles to the success of the construction
well i know i have had several of those times with my friends and family
i let him in and he took my by surprise with a big hug
it must have been around <num> in the <time>
she complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them
lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip
i hid in <person> closet and all i could hear in the background was <person> laughter and her dads footsteps
it saves time and effort with a more professional result
but we have to computer become we have to because we need
literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored
any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted
he curses in his music because its how he shows his emotion in an event
my last but not the least reason is kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer
the unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical
the pond was nice in the fact that there was a smooth side walk that circulated all the way around the pond for my sister and i to <caps> on
they should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this
this quote explains how much <person> parents sacrificed for his happiness
the mood was sweet and the room was worm with most of my family and friends
he said the new shipment should be arriving at five
the mood the author created in the memoir was very happy and thankful
be patient <caps> will com screamed <caps> from the other room
it was pretty annoying
you can find information on almost any topic
last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister
experts say that <percent> more people with handeye coordination have improved by working with computer
they should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock
my first reason why i think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community
in this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water
personally i believe that items that are found offensive should be left on the book shelves
sometimes just to help them get back on their feet
laughing is a very important part in the relationships i have with other people
there were violent wind currents at the top of the building and the blimps were never very stable
she led me down the hall told me that it was almost time for lunch so i needed <caps> get ready <caps> serve lunch
we remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole
i believe its an advantage to use it
there is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone
a laugh can say a lot
he had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg
a trip to the doctors office
the computer was the only things that mattered
and i was riding my scooter
they had many problems in the building of the empire state building
the next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions
this section are for the younger children
everyone has there own way of writing and there own imagination
parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship
so does the heat from the sun
the violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles
it has become one of my most vivid memories
having laughter means so much more than that
the author is also trying to create a comforting mood
then you might be getting all the you need because your on the computer you might not go to to get the and veggies
then we went to the movies and we waited in line and <person> was being impatient <caps> we had him save our spot
computers have evolved a long way since they were invented in the <num>
now that i decided it was <caps> i went and took a nap and actually really did fall asleep
we had to wait in line for an half an hour
also we went to the mall
someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good
<caps> many people were looking at us in the restaurant
i believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library
is it really so hard for you not to pick up a book that you <month> find offensive
peoples likes in music vary
emotions are a big deal in a persons life
they should ignore it and find something else of interest to them
his muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony
so to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust
he then faced his next problem
it helps you at work for a job and at school
thank you for your time
this communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset
hills take a bigger toll on a persons body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
they had to place the machinery at the base of this tower
they are always cheerful and warm
i think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature
censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day
<caps> said out of breath
she likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer
another statistic should that <caps> you know and use computers you would live longer and happier
computers have a very good effect on people
people need them for research and projects
this is why computers are bad
there are people getting drunk in the movie
practicing that skill is very important
we wear both smiling and having a great <time> when we jumped off and met in a hug
the features of the setting affected the cyclist
this is an example not unlike many other students parents
i think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with
it also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away
and when me and my brother both had to use the bath room i let him go first even though i was first in line
you need to be patience
the mood that he sets in this memoir is gratefulness
we arrived in <location> and had no clue where we were going
my fist reason why i believe that computer are a good thing is handeye coordination
time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem
i now see a deer about <num> yard away and shoot <caps> so my patience pays off
<caps> reads <caps> in great letters buried under decades of dust
as a student and a teenager i know i am using mine way more than i need to
my first day at school and we was having fun with a bunch of people and on that first day we had work
poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally
computers can be a very good thing to have around
before events like plays or movies you have to be patient until the movie are play begins
they just cared about the pizza
these obstacles forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction
this transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story
sometimes laughter is good <caps> comes from the heart
please understand the meaning how terrible computers are
movies are something that people love to watch come on we pay <money> to get onto see them sometimes
i have had a lot of research papers
laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was
<caps> saying that <caps> very happy that his parents did that for him
in our modern day people spend to time on computers
so all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries
it is more effective just to go to a local <organization> or <organization> to work out
my final point that is to be made is all the costs that come with computers
a huge bass take my bate
i suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though i can never be sure whether or not this is true
you really need patience if you want to get anywhere
when i was younger i went to the library all the time
builders made over <money> worth of fortifying the framework
we were waiting the to ride the skyline
nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose
the docking at the empire state building was a great idea but there were too many challenges that faced the builders
an example is when he talks about his parents
i do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive
she has gotten into some really horrible situations
illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse
these are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the empire state building <organization> in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
overall the planning of the empire state building had many difficulties
even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through
i have been dating <person> for about a month now and laughter is a big part in our relationship
it was so much fun we laughed
that is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist
it has also aided me into achieving the things i want
the kids started going crazy and they were standing on tables
which <organization> listened and kept going
it was just because the time era and it was also because he was black
all they want to do is go on the computer
i believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people
they believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library
my sister was so happy
s and giving are family a better life
being patient has its advantages
the author says the winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
they are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer
at school you need patience
setting depends on how you can go or move
libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge
there are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir
he loved how his parents gave up everything and were selfless so their kids could live normal lives and do what they wanted to do
i heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book
some people <month> take romances being offensive or comedy or horror
so i was patient enough to wait for him to get a new bait tie it and come out
this shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories
you can go on the computer and learn about it
one problem was the law
but the momma bird was still patient
the series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers
that game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain
<caps> has always made me laugh
<caps> one actually knew that he and i were friends
the mood in this memoir is gratitude
we helped each other get through everything from hard classes to family pets dying
people all around the work go so the computer to find of the latest news
this is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward
also dreams can some true for people that never have the chance to follow <caps>
i said in my eyes thats the perfect body
he sees everything as the old men told him
when she sees the <caps> it reminds her of old home where she fit in
age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set
a social life is very important to a <num> grater
i think that computers are amazing
that law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building
if you know what i mean
it was also a way to end the story in a good note
their conversation caught my attention and held it
history is a big part of life that everyone one should know
one way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water
each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe
not all censorship has to do with sex
from my humble opinion some parents are very strict about censorship and i completely understand the parents point of view
during the first <num> minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing
the mood created by <person> in the memoir from home the blueprints of our lives is one of generosity and friendship
but his friends kept him going saying the traffic is good we need to keep going
what her parents did for her was incredible and something to learn from
i hold the power to choose the books i read and the responsibility to choose the books best suited for my age and maturity level
some have short attention spans
the author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves
i became more willing to wait
one time i had to use patience when we were driving to <caps>
for example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up
so he said that we would go to the store and see how much it is
<caps> one you need a lot of patience
everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book
everyone has their own opinion and <caps> is mine
the magazine industry really hurts children in the long run
others though say that censorship is unnecessary because people are going into the library and looking for a book at their own risk
a computer is a big need in todays growing technological advances
still with love burning inside of us
winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast
it could also let them communicate
with this the author clearly shows the mood for love and happiness
i saw my brother coming from the corner of my eye
i mean i like them to but not that much
or even people who cant talk use computers to talk for them
this caused another <money> to be spent trying to fix this problem
we fly down the hall <caps> rush up the stairs
take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run
this shows a loving mood because it shows how much <caps> cared and loved his parents
now i can wait now longer
there is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material
these have been some moods in this story
if libraries take the information out of the library the students will not be able to find the info needed for their project or paper
we were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because thats were the boys will be hanging out and sleeping
thats why patience is as important
its not like we will never see them again i said to my brothers
the next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas
thank you for your time
some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy
the cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling
i found out how to do it and it worked
that is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else
that was another obstacle the builders had to overcome considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below
there were many problems the builders of the empire state building faced when it came to dirigibles
so everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects be taping their plants on their poster
you might end up being lonely
the greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind
i think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days
then i went to take my other id
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
in <organization> seriously there was an event called <caps>
that is why it always helps to be patient
this is why people should agree that advance in technology
then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything
so i hope i have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over <caps> movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children
the lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people
there are little kids that will want to look at anything they can get their hands on
no opinion or view is right or wrong
the builders faced many obstacles that set them back but they made a valiant attempt to see their dream come true
it is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not
some of the problems faced was there is a law in the u
first <caps> because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again
if not everybody would get bored of the same books
a few months ago i was at the library
<caps> was happy for the simple house they had and was grateful
we started to <caps>
and there was nothing that they could do to change this
but instead is composed of those whom you love and who love you
<caps> i cant contact my mom i email her on my computer
<caps> a alert saying that someone sent you a email
i would do it on the computers if i miss it
all of this happened with me recording
this is a very interesting question
i thank that all of the books and movies and more should not be censorship because people have a right to no what they what to no or see
the fact that it was a hot summers day contributed to his hardships
i <caps> it how i can be myself with him
this cost them time and money due to the massive hight of the empire state building
i have been to many libraries in my life
it toke three days of driving
also with increased computer time people are not getting outside
they would not let me listen to the music i liked
even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas
mind you all of my clothes and shoes were over her house still
the only way they should put music or movies on there is if they have learning materials in it
informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge
i know you as a <organization> would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would
i guess i <caps> needed patience and to relax
computers are a menace to society
think of it in your own perspective
we have known and been with each other for the past <num> years of our lives
he says the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
all sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore
a lot of people over used it too
when i was in <num> grade my teacher ms
it would make everything far less dramatic
<caps> would take <caps> into town to buy her a cheeseburger and go to the park
this was a major obstacle along with the wind factor
one major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode
day <num> i had about <num> bottles of water and all day my stomach groaned some with my sister
first off <caps> is a major concern many blimps were filled with hydrogen which is extremely explosive
this then ends my essay
music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time
they sacrificed their laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in <location> to give their children more opportunity
this lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy
he became more like a grandfather than a neighbor
the sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying
it all depends on the person
computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect
<person> was stunned and excited that <organization> wanted her to be his girlfriend
the computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside
the were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigibles
i take back two things from this crazy day
this shows how nice and how well the neighborhood got along
i had to find something else to do
there were numerous obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there were many and at the end the dock could not happen
i try my hardest to be patient
it <caps> on forever
my first reason not everyone should use a computer is because they get so distracted in the computer they forget about school
at <num> we went up the hill and was like a meteorite crashing down into earth
the lady with the big feet ended up being the owner of those two rusty broken down cars
the definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please
freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions
i took the reprimands silently and went to my locker
<person> came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug
some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries
last but not least that <caps> why i know computers benefits our society
this eventually lead to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of <organization>
i blubbered <caps> she said
i needed to know but i had to <caps>
i am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
hunting have in patience in it
they could easily go to play and talk with family and friends if they wanted to
one way is to get the local libraries to participate in putting restrictions on the cards of young children
i have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of
this can go on and on
but when he sees the abandoned <person> grape juice factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert
libraries should be able to put what they want on their shelfs
one time when i was patient was when i was fishing
safety is the reason because the weight on the building would be dangling above people on the street which would be unsafe
the reason that mooring mast was because of nature
<person> ended up getting full points on the entry when he turned it into his teacher
another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type
i started laughing and my laugh is very odd
after about an hour and a half they called our name
i also know <caps> computers can or will help people all around the world
the main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state buildings mooring mast was safety
so that is my story about being patient
i had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes
i have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule
well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a <location>
so let me express my love for computers to you
one thing that a computer makes easier
now a days their are a lot more shier people who are scared to <organization> people and be friend
there were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast
one could not simply place one on the empire state building because it would add stress to the buildings frame
i think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children
i understand the computers lots of fun
i have used patience in my life when i got my first horse
i think <caps> best memory of it all was when we had our <caps> <caps> <caps>
the two others will be about your friends and family
music does not kill people
how the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting
in every building or project there must the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm
and nobody should ever try to take that away
computers are amazing advancement and this is why you should use one
they can teach us about things
and i also laugh a lot
i want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier
another obstacle was the weather
the first mood created by the author in the memoir was powerful
my grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened
i had to stop playing for the <time>
my friend that went with me to the party her name is <person>
the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
those are some ways the author created the mood in the story
you <month> ask <caps> the amount <organization> time <caps> spend on computers is much more damaging than this
i for one think that the computer was come to be one of the greatest inventions ever created
i have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual
i can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things i <month> have learned in school or wanted to learn
<caps> in the the <caps> finish constructing it but the dirigibles could not dock there
the builders of the empire state building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
because some of the things are very mean in books and movies
first the climate was a recipe for a disaster
i think the mood of the author is love and family
later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path
mom that our favorite song
some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion
i was really really mad
these are just a few of the things books are written about
for example it states in the text
this would reinforce the building against the pressure a dock dirigible would create
parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others
by the time we reached <location> <caps> was already <num>
a time when i had to be patient was when i needed help with my schoolwork
<person> gets up and does the same
so it would be a lot harder to makeup
i was at swim practice and was about to dive off of lane <num>
one major thing that about laughter is the whole point of view
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer
it also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience
that in itself was a memory i will never forget
on <date> we went to the flea market and it was huge
it was then i had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing
the world today in the <location> is hardly free
when the bus stopped at the <caps> we all started running and striping down to are swim trunks
another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety
we then cleaned up and got ready for the second assembly
as you <month> see many people that have computers use it in a productive way
that could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble
when i called on me i asked her and <caps> said <caps>
the last paragraph states that when they come back
patience is a quality that is important
so thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this
i believe that these three reasons are the main reason we use computers today
there are books that will explain it for you
its a free country and they have they will to freedom of speech
this complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out
so therefore he knew he was in trouble
she had a lot of memories from one home
they teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned
once when i was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that i grew up in
it is their job to show them the right path
the first obstacle was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
map tools says there has never been a flaw in their system
i got yelled at and had to sit out for a while
this is a time i had patience
so if they hear a swear word on t
at that point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollable
they might be paying a bill by the computer
we know this by looking back at the text
seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time
i am thinking good thing i was not part of it because i might get kicked from the cross country team
all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship
this is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show she has hope
this brings me to the last point
every one of us were sopping wet
for example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states with only luck id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat
the match was very shortlived
i was laughing and having a great time with the kids
if there is no laughter in a relationship with two people it tends to get awkward and neither person can feel comfortable opening up to each other
the author creates a mood of joy and thankfulness in the memoir of how great life was and how grateful he is for what was given to him
i yelled back to my mom as i was running out of the car door
i think that the great outdoors is the way to go because <location> needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer
its so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with
he also mentioned that he would enjoy playing a game or two with me during this time
they faced problems with
this and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship
spring is a symbol of fresh start
for example my brother
people should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places
another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions
the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset
this made it illegal for ship to even go near the building
<caps> we arrived and she asked if i wanted to come inside and i said no ill wait in the car
<person> was baptized there
it was a cold <date> when i walked out of my house one morning to go to school
but there will always be someone who is unhappy
we are best friends for a reason were definitely not boring which i think keeps us so close
that is the most important mood set in this memoir because she is thanking her parents for her life that she has
our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam
they had no landing gears what so ever so it was hard to steady it and dock it
computers can help open people up to unique genres of music they have never listened to before
entering the band room i had a feeling that <date> was different
some people can find these items very educational and they might be able to relate to that book that other people would say is offensive
i tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school when i come home
i went and hoked <caps> that while my dad read a book
those are just a couple of many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced
hope <caps> have that much fun going <caps> practice again
<caps> dad thought the dog treats were cookies <caps> ate one
they allow you to see places
both of these diseases are lethal
the mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad
the computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people
<caps> i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life
those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books
this way people can know what to expect if they read <caps>
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
its even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment
if there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library
the mood of the memoir is that he is growing up in the house with his mother and father
the mood created by the author is one of loving mood
this affected him many ways
i was so patient waiting in one
<person> <caps> <caps> one <date> of <date> break me and a <caps> went <caps> with my <caps> on the boat in <location>
somewhere along the road a guy once said a laugh a day keeps the doctor away
many people cannot patiently wait to see a <caps>
i was patient because i did not get angry and i waited
each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place
movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time
he escaped just in time to stop one of his kids from going to an illegal party
the authors setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding
my mom always says that that is how she stays close to her friends and that is the same with me
i love to spend time with my friends and family
in turn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter
such as a homework question or just to talk for fun
movies apply to the same rights and topics
i had to roll the window down because the car got pretty smelly
also your students computers <month> get viruses because of inappropriate sites
he almost had a heat stroke a few times
i want to talk about interacting with family and friends
some books with adult content <month> be suitable for more intelligent minds
advances in technology
we gave each other hugs
we can not be on the <caps> <num> looking up what <person> said to <person>
this is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers
some materials could be seen as offensive to some people
a water fall about as tall as a man
most of the time when you are laughing about something you are with someone else
my dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit
this made it very hard to dock the dirigibles
aim is a good way to talk to friends and plan get together
in this article i am given information about this main characters life and his caring parents
just nonhurtful things
computers can also help us in school
the winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building
the builders also faced the laws about flying that low over an urban area
i think its not the people to not get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features
over <percent> of people get the song from the computer
i swore i was falling in love
some items <month> offend someones beliefs and be rude
it is there and part of our life
i make my own choice to not watch or <caps> those kinds of materials
it is just something that we will have to deal with
that use could be for a design on the front of a cover page for an essay or project
which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody
the other part of this mood was safety
the first reason why i think this is because people in the world are becoming less healthy kids and adults should stay <caps> more
this would make it extremely difficult to land just because of its weight
i was going to die he says
this is social time lost
no matter how much computer do they <month> be but it is kids getting bigger and bigger all because they long
laughing is something that everyone experiences
computers are very helpful and they are easy to use
i was <caps> excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me
i personally had an experience where laughter was all i could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay
but creators of the computer are worried that people are spending to much time on the computer
most writers include this material for a reason
being able to reconnect with someone is very important
i think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family
we also have six girls including me
lets find out what i have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people
<date> passed by and it was <date>
kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air
the text says pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid
<caps> song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men
some readers who read such things can turn those words into action
if they trust their children with these materials then that is their choice
younger students libraries should be monitored even more carefully
in summary patience is one way element to life
i think these should be a limit on a computer so people spend less time on the computer and more exercising
the author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well
statistics show that the average obese child spends <percent> their free time on a computer
when i was in the taxi and there was traffic outside
i spent the night at my grandparents house
hes in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because hes anticipating another one
they get people fat an lazy because they only want to be on the computer
finally <person> was really ready to go so this was his last chance
i <month> not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would
he is in the middle of nowhere
these are <caps> <num> reasons
also my mama had to go to other places to
the world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people
another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down
after that ride we sold my four wheeler and got a <num> <organization>
that is why i think more people should use computers
so <num> past we still in line my family started fussing
what the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas
i think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way
this relates to the quote because it states they struggled
i have had some moments like this and i sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh
the look on <caps> face was priceless
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
for example he states growing up in this new instilled in me a great family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
in the <date> if you wanted to speech with some one who is far away you would have to send a letter
to communicate with my friends i use email or aim
saying that all can be family as long as you care about each other
computers also give us the ability to research places and things we <month> never get the opportunity to see in person
if you have patience its almost like a gift just like singing and dancing one a gift
the person controlling the ride explained
almost like the anger just vanished
people take advantage of computers and end reading peoples infos
computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers
here is my opinion on if i think that those books should be removed or not
only the corner of the bed had broken so we were all pulled down into that corner
i finish another book so i wrote my name again
it <month> be at an elegant restaurant sitting at a petite table in the distant corner
it is hard to have patience when you want something when you already have it
no i do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries
it is faster and more accurate
<caps> you for teaching me <caps>
if a dirigible were to dock there it would also be breaking laws
after the food we got two slices of double chocolate lava cake
i try not to use the computer unless i have too for school or to get homework
all i have to do is wait
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families
the author was getting neat stroke being passed by <location> desert snakes and tumbleweeds
when they ended the story i thought to myself how nice it ended
as simple as it is you do it or do not
that is how i was patience
her name was <person> and she is not in a good mood today
the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been
can be found offensive
some of the things they faced were safety hazards
<caps> smile faded quickly once i heard those rumors that spread through <caps> class like a disease
another word would be being patient
<caps> really opened up my eyes and i am extremely happy i read <caps>
it was the hardest for <date> and i because we were best friends and did everything together
handeye coordination is an important skill that many people lack
but the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak
they got everything they needed fishing pots
kids like me always have homework on the computer
hopefully i have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want
these are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir
so when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves
he is most happy about how he learned about the real meaning of family
people want to be able to do more than just talk
but it was still awesome
no one else understood the bond that my grandpa and i had
sometimes his decisions are not the smartest
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had
in my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing
you have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end
it was her report card
would add stress to the buildings frame
the children <month> be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident
he had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy
just sitting there on the computer will get you
the computer is excellent
the choir girls began singing about going to the bathroom
finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them
the words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake
imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all
individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room
then the story takes an unexpected turn
so <caps> grandmother came to her house because we have a keys
any parent would agree with that statement
<caps> friends pick me out to be the clown in our group
then she went <caps> the phone and called her dad
some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the <caps> grade
these are the many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on the empire state building
if they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to <caps>
i was thinking of the <caps> movie that i had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me
which i can understand why someone would want to escape
the greatest obstacle though was nature itself as stated in paragraph <num>
the final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building
the more people feel home bond the more they will come
now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way i said it
if we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books
a time i had to be patient was when we went to <location>
one day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer
<caps> people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time
the first obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from
the feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her
and when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road
this made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the empire state building
we began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song
i swear i got all of my exercise from <caps> with her
i was letting people that i called friends drag me to the bottom when i knew i should be more at the top
my mom was yelling at this unknown figure about child support and signing over his rights to my dad
the use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented
that is how <person> be patient
parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things
having <location> as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened
but then one day she was going to take a shower but then people kept on going and she got patient for a while and i got up there
they would keep coming up behind me and hitting me in the back and running away
i believe that there should not be censorship in media
she was going to make a blanket
i disagree with that statement
the rapidly growing need for social dominance and in turn inflating egos makes for a bully breeding ground
computers are fun for many different reasons
this conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future
i was still a little embarrassed but i was over it
these are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme
badly he said yes <caps> ran home
the mood is also sad
no we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves
my second reason is doing homework
there also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book <caps> <num>
i feel strongly about people knowing about the worlds past
his parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny
censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing
he taught me so much about loving someone
in conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way
i believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials
since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it
that is why towns offer these activities
would be coming quickly
pitch black outside but light <caps> warm in
she had good relations in her house
it would be like them being in the room with you
just to add to the misfortune of the story
the author is hot from the sun
another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends
overall think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome
my outlook on the effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive
if you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time
they do because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one pitcher that is in it
the greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mass was nature itself because the wind was so strong
libraries are open to any one that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about
he realized this was going to be hard
then i realize i need someone to go with me
that was time when i was patient
citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible
to were no little kids can rent the book
either get over <caps>
<caps> explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him
there is a simple answer to this question
the <caps> had many obstacles building the empire state building and also allowing dirigibles to <caps> there
i was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her
<caps> clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be
i mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves
computers teach and improve valuable handeye coordination
her mom went to the office and got the real grades and my friend <person> was patient while she said the truth
an i had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats
the computer has anything for anyone
just look what happened in <location>
what you see or read can really have an affect on you
so they can talk to their friends
one time when i felt bad my cousin came over and made me laugh
so to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelfs is no different than the rest of the day
<caps> a joke that nobody in the family laughs at <location> comments but herself and thats how <caps> remains
i was doing a water depleting <num>
i did that for maybe the first time in my life to say hi to her
fly cut at our seats
playing catch with their kids or even playing a board game with them
i moaned to <caps> mother
these are some moods that the author was trying to show
the following are obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced
<caps> rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed
there are many books over these topics that many people <month> find offensive or just completely oblivious
i disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect
i started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession
this is good for those who are busy and travel a lot
they are always finding some way to be funny and annoying
to watch the geese return
energy he barely has
they should be spending time with family and friends
this again saw how grateful the author is
my heart almost jumping out of my body so much anticipation
we were the only ones on the road at the moment
this shows why computers are bad
computers can also be used for amusement
during my freshman year we read a book called <caps> <num> and before we read it our teacher told us a little bit about what it is about
the next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode
with the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your <caps>
about <percent> of kids use computers to talk to there friends but some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad
home to this boy is about family and relationships
when doing this they are typically
the author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir
it can also help you with your job
everyday we have choices
you can even learn new recipes
a practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles at the empire state building was because of the law against airships
i could feel the tension building as we turned onto <caps> street and drove towards <caps> house
happy because even though it was a new country the came with a purpose and are living it with their culture which is past down family to family
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area
kind of like the time when i was in <location> baking a pie with my <caps> <caps>
the problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable
with a guy <caps> just met
i was beginning to very well open up to him but was not getting the same in return
censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one
then when there was only <num> minutes left when they cut everything down i watched us land in <location>
thank you for listening
a fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers
now i realize how patient i was with her
even though she lied and tried to change her grade
his kitchen has aromas of food filling the air
these are necessities for all people to have access to
the messages shared through the eyes a best friend can silently bring up subjects never spoken about and make us laugh
the community and <organization> comes together to help out those who needs a hand
it should be clear that computers are a danger to society
i was waiting for the well to ring
there were quit a few problems with there idea of using the empire state building is a landing dock for dirigibles
it is needed has many advantages
dear newspaper i disagree with the hole computer thing i think its just a wast of money and its a wast of time for kids
the cost to improve the buildings framework was also an obstacle
it is one of the most comforting feelings in the world
another obstacle was safety
you have to look at it in the publishers view also
it gives you the to try something you <month> enjoy what you get
i think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one
it could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more
a total twist to someone unfamiliar with <organization> weather
another obstacle was the dirigibles was held by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the buildings frame
this means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray
the day was going good i was making hoops and i had some good jokes every one was laughing
no registration to get a library card
you got to come back to earth and spend time with your family
explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life
<caps> asked in a worried voice
we learn information about the world and about what is going on
one was complaining how the farm books never get messed with
magazines that are bad should be taken off the shelf
some people <month> want to read or watch something with such content
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
the docking system its self was also a problem
<organization> a recent study at <organization> shows that <percent> of schools in <caps> use computers for research
finally someone yelled just be patient they will call
and my conclusion with all three reasons
my story showed that a laughter is able to change peoples thoughts and to short the distance between two people
<date> weeks ago there seemed to be some hope that my best friend and i would be again able to communicate as before
as years pasted things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself
i did pass the course and am becoming a good <caps>
you need exercise to stay healthy too
<caps> the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail
the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast
the author had a very close relationship with his neighbors
the temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water
secondly computers are another way to go to collage
it bothers them they could get in trouble with school and at home
first of all computers are a big help when it comes to a computer class at your school
that is your opinion and you have all of the right to it
the way you want to live your life is up to you
people or some people would like to vote or have a meeting about taking a book or books off the shelf cause its offensive to them
there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas
this was the story when i used patience
so every now and then laugh for once and be happy even if it is for a few seconds in your life
she ate dinner with her <caps> then she went <caps> bed
you can study different foods and cultures around the world
all of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest
we stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying
the mood that this author creates is the gratefulness
the section should be locked up so children cant get that kind of music
its been proven that computers cause memory loss
think about how life would be in the <date> without computers
laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships
this is also good for jobs
the features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways
she was very offended
<caps> starts to tell us about his first friend <person> and how they lived above him
will leave someone with nothing to read now
we all had a good laugh <caps> kept playing games <caps> listening to <organization>
the author choses to end the story like this to inspire a sense of determination
one person cant change everything to fit their needs
so for about <num> minutes she helped me
for example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place
being a kid and all i felt ashamed even though i knew i was telling the truth
it is later said that these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars
third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family
i had to search but there was no space to
the beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if its nothing special
the mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood
many time technology is needed in everyones life
libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended
the setting in the story rough road ahead plays a great role on the characters journey
in fact it has a very positive effect of me
this was making him dehydrated
she usually was so calm and in control
i called her back to apologize for missing her phone call
another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories
and we all was dress alike for my birthday
so i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way
a time when i had to use patiences was when i thought of a great poem
depends on the parent
when we finally got out of the store we rushed home to start decorating
i have to be patient
another obstacle the <caps> faced was the <caps> had to complete the roof before the framing of the mooring mast could take place
stupid things that people do are the funniest things
students also use computers to look up information
her mother talked to her and then she felt better
and three it will keep us updated on sports we like to catch especially if your a sports fanatic
with some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that <month> contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across
once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them
computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today
i had ever been on and all the other people that came too
the desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest
putting mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and putt a lot of pressure on it
we all know that there are books out there are parents hope we never get a hold of
eventually you will get hooked and play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends
the cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert
they left their family and friends to give their son a better life
at this point he thinks its time to say something funny
this girl just failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away
it can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is
i looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head
when the ride was over i quickly went to my dad
many of <caps> employees work from home and have to own computers
so now you know that a computer helps you in the future
its always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there
another reason computers are good is because you can talk to friends and family who are far away using something called <caps>
we barley said a few words on that day of class
when he got to the second town i notice the terrain changing
i suggested a choice for him and he ordered
computers are sure to be our future
i got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it
then i saw her again
many people find this movie funny and entertaining
one obstacle was there was a it was illegal for airships to fly to low over urban areas
the author is proving that shell go back and shell be ready
computer are also a new way to get entertained
another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the empire state building
but when is saw the dunes i knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but i did
i love being on the <caps>
and taking those things away from a library <caps> taking it away from adults as well as kids
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
we are also making ourselves ignorant this way
he is really thirsty and theres no water anywhere
no one can stop them
all this time with this fun could be spent doing studying or something to help you out in the future
then the <caps> asked me questions and my foster mom question
then in no time you will be hanging out with your friend
my dad on the other hand never laughs
my last reason is because on a computer you <caps> pretty much look for anything
the lack of water also mad it difficult for him
the setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the heat
it sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it
the <caps> is happy and <caps> that friends are family too
if your sitting in front of a computer all day your body is going to shut down and wont get the proper exercise
also computers can help you with your homework
those who are glued to their computer screens are no better
music helps people find their activity in many ways
the author explains were he lived as a child very vividly
well if theres a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help
when we got on the gravel road my dad started making the car slide back and fourth scarring <caps>
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped
patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain
those were the obstacles facing the architects
which will be bring yo my next topic
after this day i believe with a little humor <caps> father an is relationship can get through anything
the author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph
that would be a terrible thing
she was still apologizing and i was still in the ignoring mood
i do not really understand that
it made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it
i thought the world would be a better place without me
she vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew herself and get back on track
like a phone or to get on the computer or something
telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning
talking drew us even closer
the original design did not include a dirigible docking station
the author was running out of water throughout the whole story
settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive
laughter is a major thing to have in your life
computers help find and get new <caps>
i became fast friends with the three other people in the <organization>
this is a quick and easy fix
next <caps> book week ill be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting <caps>
this was important because if designed wrong the mast would put stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage
in conclusion i told you when i was patient at the hospital
sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life
if there is a book out there that is about back in the day when <caps> had slaves and if there calling them a name that is not very nice
the first puzzle posed to the builders concerned the structure
with all the profanity found in todays society you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library
winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together
next was a guy who was a veteran
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
this symbolizes that it is against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area
when they do call i rush right to the phone and answer it right away
this sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm
three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people
research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten
told her what the doctors told us
after <num> minutes i was bored
in <num> i when to outdoor school it was fun and cool
so leaving it like that was all i could think of
in reallife situations you <month> only have a few seconds to react
the winds on top of the building were always shifting which could lead to the back of the ship swiveling around and around the mooring mast
the material should be removed if they offend their gender
most people do not realize what sort of trouble they will start with censorship
quickly i retreated to my room and onto my bed
many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page
the heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride
there are other types of library items in the library that could be censored
a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining most people are impatient these days
she went to the dance floor and danced with some guys
thats understandable in the case that we have numerous amount of different races in <location>
he speaks about his house and family
it shows your character to people if your patient or not
its a gorgeous <date> day
that is what i think the authors mood is
people should get off the computer and make some plans with their family
i think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library
so <caps> thing can happen if you do the wrong stuff
if you want to know more about different cultures such as <caps> <caps>
that was all i did that day
normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free
if you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies
the original problem was figuring out how to get the dirigible onto the building
i believe that this technology is a great help to society today
from <person> step mom
censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around
the mood in the story is very happy
thats all you have to do and not make anything big about it
they could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in
this would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approached the building
with a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question
the setting becomes positive and so does he
the builders of the empire state building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
she thought days would go by radius
i want to tell you one story of my life when laughter played a huge role
<caps> when the game started
the last <caps> i spent with my grandpa i bought lots of presents for him and my family
people did not believe that he was born in <location>
i guess my sister is like me because she did the same
it tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do
the youth of our country do not need to be seeing all of these actions and hearing these messages
he finally got the xbox fixed after about seven or eight hours
we estimate <percent> of this next generation will be legally blind before age <num>
computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer
it rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom
the features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons
knowledge is all around us
also i believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it gives her strength from her old country
as you can see the computer can help society
the dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building
i was glad too because i was tired
give them what they want
as he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face
together we laughed at everything that amused us
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
in his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on
when shes willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence
<percent> <organization> the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain
the line was very and when i mean very i mean long
<caps> this is one of the many times laughter brought <caps> cousin <person> <caps> i together
we had lost the second <caps>
but if i go to the instant message website then i can talk to her as much as i want
another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building
just have to control yourself
if there was twenty different <person> books on the shelves many people would be able to look at them and check them out as they please
computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers
<caps> mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in <caps> teenage drama life
this in turn makes the world illiterate
when we all came back to reality we realized <caps> was time to head home so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop
they are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key
<caps> a stated earlier computers many problems in <location> social lives
the author is grateful that his parents left their homes and left everything behind to give a better life to their kids
this <caps> the exact same for information of all types
these day if not <percent> then <percent> of house designers use computers
winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
she was crying in the store and just very depressed
but it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert
it gets shipped to our house in less than a week
this made a picture of a happy and laughing family like in the movies about the holidays
teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word
it seems like everyday of everyones life they are being tested in every way shape and form and it seems like it will never end
many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen
one day he sent letter to a random address and waited and waited and waited
the road became bumpy and curry
my first major reason is it can and does help hand eye coordination every day
you should do what you want at your own risk
meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland
he learned the true meaning of family
computers and almost everyday
i can tell he has a huge heart and it all starts at home
everyday when i was in <num> grade i always wanted something that would change my life eternally
the building also had to be rebuilt to be able to come close to staying stable with the dirigible attached
then i started to use the computer more and my coordination improved
many people see many different things
the overall mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness
we were the first ones to the bus so it took a while before they came
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there
they might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature
the author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this
he writes all of these cultures came together showing great solidarity and friendship
i waited for an answer but i guess he just resorted to ignoring me
their was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities
<caps> was a big deal in the late <num> to early <date>
everything thats in the library is not appropriate for all ages
learning about places is very important because you could get lost
on this day my boyfriend <person> from <location> decided that <caps> wanted to take me out to an early breakfast
but not everybody agrees on this statement
more and more kids are falling into those traps
she also said in paragraph <num> she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home
also they made him a home
but this is why people become overweight and obese
<person> lurched back and slammed against the bedroom door
also his lack of water was a problem to begin with
i have read the series <num> times and i am still reading them
nature was another big problem
i said that i will be nice and considerate today and not be mean
that applies to everything that could contain offensive material
the person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more
i looked at him and told him that <caps> might not want to <caps> that but <caps> said that is was fine <caps> done this before
were was the best roller coaster i had ever been on
i think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to
she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky
these computer websites are allowing anyone to talk in people who could have the interest in mind
it felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal
i seen so many materials that i think are not proper for people under age to been looking at
it <month> have taken a few days of trying really hard to do so
the most important thing was bringing family and strong relationships into the house making it an actual home
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because of nature itself and the past problems that happened
the obstacles that stood before the empire state buildings mast were to great to optimistically believe the project could be finished
like <date> actually we are going camping up in <location>
the computer <month> have sites where you can talk to friends but that is no where as good as seeing them in person
i played soccer for a rec
the load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was elevenhundred feet below
i watched all at the people just sitting there some were on laptops and listening to <caps> players
thank you for taking the time to read <caps> essay and i hope you can see things <caps> way
some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas
not only can you talk to grandma or grandpa but you can even see them smile what children can even such as <caps>
by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easer
and i am glad that she was
a memoir is of writing someones own feelings and experiences during their life
other use them to talk to family and friends that are far away
my health teacher that is
it could also help save our planet by saving the energy
i would be sitting in all asylum
and thank you for having time to read this
people go to the library to find certain types of material
so i think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day
i told her i was scared to introduce myself
after they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play
certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion
students can use a computer to do a research paper for lets say history
on our way back to my house from <organization> we watched the people drive by and laughed at all the people singing in their cars while stopped at the light
people have died because they spent too much time on the <caps> without eating and sleeping
imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters
we do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read
these people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch <caps>
computers then come in handy
to be patient is to be understanding and tolerant
when i got out of the car she asked me if i had my money with me
i knew that something had changed in me when i hung <caps> the phone on <caps> father
when we got to the hotel we picked are bads then jumped in the car to go to <caps> <caps> it <num> awesome
this is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test
everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together
she says that i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
it wont be ready until another hour
in life <caps> share many of your moments laughing and enjoying the sweet and gentle sound of the chorus that <caps> and the people in your life share
these were <num> of the many obstacles that the builders of the empire state were faced with
therefor it would be impossible for a ship to land there
censoring libraries would take away these peoples right to such topics
i woke up on a sunny day which was odd for <organization> because it was late <date>
the bulky front door opened and closed again followed by footsteps coming up to my room
they must learn how to become successful in life
everything can be saved to a laptop
books such as gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories of which some cant read
it seemed like a perfect area to board in
after all we got out and when home
his mood was also very appreciative
his parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him
not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio
we as <caps> have the right to freely state our opinions and what we believe
the crowed roared as we entered the field
therefore explains that computers are not good for society
i believe computers have a positive effect on people
in my case my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad
what we ready to do whatever is needed
you are just one person
a disaster like that would have been much worse
my grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young
all of these <caps> can us research projects many other <caps>
his parents worked hard for what they worked for and no one can take that away
many places show and sell offensive material
they have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases
at the empire state buildings hight it would have been illegal to land a dirigible
this topic is about personal opinion and choice
also having a thousandfoot dirigible at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would add too much stress on the frame of the building
the ending almost repeats this line
<caps> laughed for almost a minute
the features of the setting affect the cyclists attitude towards the old men
today the <caps> of <organization> is a famous and classic book
his description of this home is very soothing to me because it just has a happy background and his talk so highly of
in my own opinion i think the setting is the most important part
over sixty thousand dollars
it would not be fair or right to remove books from the library
children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen
but as second road sign appeared he was relieved
there were many obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles
she wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding
the empire state building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds
one big obstacle they faced was a big safety problem
<caps> whispered as <caps> left the room
the third and final reason is it is illegal to have an aircraft that low in a city
my first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project
another obstacle that the architects faced was safety
the line got longer in just a few minutes
these things can still benefit our society though
i think that people should see everything the way it is
laughter has <caps> boundary
computers help us everyday
and they did get lucky
<person> struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life
then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped
this memoir had one theme that meant many different things
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
as <caps> another girl from the squad rounded the corner she fell straight onto her face
in conclusion compare use be encouraged
the second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions
he told me it is going to be at a different day
to <caps> being patient means to not while if you ordered something and its taking long to come to you
everyone reacts to things differently
the first problem builders came across was the possibility that the buildings framework was not potentially strong enough to support a dirigibles weight
maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up onehundred points or go down onehundred points
if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life
on that <date> i realized that the laughs shared between <organization> and i would be the first memory for what was to come
libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves
mainly because where i live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby
people can just not pick the book up and look for another book
there are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society
if you ask me i think that is a positive effect computers have
the boy is happy he lives in the <location> but his parents gave up so much for him
libraries are a great resource for information all around the world
the builders of the empire state building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building
finally school was over and as we were all saying our good byes and see you next year to all our friends
we could not stop talking to save our lives
he finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores
at that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong
the builders thought they would be able to make a successful landing dock for dirigibles
i also got a good handeye coordination
then we went every were my mom and dad wanted to go not were i wanted to
a persons eye sight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer everyday
in the excerpt the mooring mast by <organization> faced many problems with the attempt to allow blimps to dock their
books have been around for a very long time
this one was called <caps>
its people who chose not to fill there lives with the joy of laughter
the cyclist and also be attracted mentally
would add stress to the buildings frame
so much for taking the short way
it is very hard being patient to do fun things
it is practically the same with books
stop reading this article and go out and meet new friends
<person> and i start looking everywhere for his shoe
your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient
but i was cool with it i new i was bad because it was the first time
laughter eased the pain and sorrow of that dreadful day
after hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map
mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show
the cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration
you can just order them
fine something unless to read about
removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class
my second reason states that there is some history on many different websites
when a person reads they always learn something new
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles
if a dirigible docked before the whale building would twist and sway
this meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated
theres something for everyone in a library
<caps> i started to sing the never ending song again
man must know his foundation and where he comes from
people lose jobs over computers
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water
everyone has been teased once in their life
those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually
i say get read of it all and do everyone a favor
<person> just stared at them as <caps> darted around the room
winds and other complications were preventative
i am going to write about the time that i was patient
people should be happy about the computer invention
the nurse said that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor
the flames had gotten so close to my face that i could feel my eyelashes burning on the tips
i love the computer it helps keep me close to <caps> loved ones
their would be arguments of what to remove and what not to
i came over to her and casually started making small talk with her
the other obstacle which prevented dirigibles from mooring at the empire state building was due to the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities
also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others
architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the buildings frame work and cost <money> in modifications
my first reason why i believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with
all the staff new me by then and by now it was harder for me to make my ways out
giving strangers you information they can trace you down and find the street you live on
those are two examples of how a computer can bring people together
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very positive
the library is a wonderful place to read in a quite place
i know this because in paragraph <num> the author writes i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
then what will our future generation be like
he was only a couple years older than me
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
someone will pick you up soon
although much time has passed since our separation i still have those days when i feel that my world is caving in around me because they are so far away
i believe they are already censored enough
music is used for many different ways
because its rely important to have handeye
they are happy with their life
in other words laughter pulled me out of <caps> awful pit i hid away in and made me find <caps> true friends in <caps>
about my grades being dropped
thats how the authors mood was
specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad
you can explore nature on the computer
there are many quotes in the memoir that support the mood created
they would have to design a mast for the dirigibles
also kids can do their projects
i asked who the person was and waited for a response
were using our knowledge of how to communicate with others
what is in these stores only makes us stronger
<caps> with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat
then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated
she is a very patient and pleasant girl
hydrogen is highly flammable
that is what patients means to me and everyone has to use <caps> and <caps> is part of your daily life
it sounds like an awful experience
in the end there were too many obstacles so the dirigible docking plan was scrapped
in the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness
she would spend all day and all night on it
they have the same affect
during the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars
i sat quietly in a chair
the sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions
some are about subjects we love and could read about for days
i was patient wen i saw a huge bass jump out from at my cottage
the site of my mother and aunt was so ridiculously funny i had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry
<caps> we got back to <caps> house everyone was laughing
that to make a hopeful home
he moved in with my family and shared my bedroom
probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer
and that is bad enough
if anything the reader might even like the book and check it out
there should be a certain age when a child reads or sees certain things
the existing skeleton of the building had to be edited
the mood in this memoir changes throughout the story
they would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast with out having it swing in the wind
<caps> admires them and their courage
so parents please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer
laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other
they should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities
not all children and teens are drawn to reading
my personal view is that i think it wrong to have those kind of books at the library
if so you probably would be smart to go to <location>
music is music and it is there to be listened too
when i was a boy of <num> years i had survey low handeye coordination skills and my playing suffered because of it
i think a computer would always have a positive affect on people
it seems like there is never a dull moment when it comes to that time of year
they allow you to write efficiently and neatly
they were also worried about the back weight of the ship
computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish
at the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books
it affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has
one problem was safety
we entered the locker room a moment before my <caps>
then finally wait for the shells to pop
once she was gone for the night i began to think
then when everyone was back on the bus the light turned red again
i relate <caps> to the way my friends and i act and the way i act towards strangers
after all the freedom of speech is written in our rights
books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education
most of them are very good effects that can lead you to become more selfconfident
typing to long or to much can cause your fingers to lock up and it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain
in the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch
some can be offensive to someones race or religion
a commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is the <caps> of <caps> <caps>
i had such a great time while i was in <location>
this can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes
and we just crack up in laughter
the wind would be too much for a dirigible to handle
we have the choice to pick what we read and listen to
laughter is important in many ways
the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast
i then remembered that i was supposed to be patient so i was
a time when i patient was during last <date>
my cousin <person> said
they also search for addressed and phone number
there was a line about <num> people my dad and i were starting to get impatient so i told myself to calm down and wait
when you go to a library you should be able to go their and get whatever genre that you want and their be no restrictions
this revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive
in the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike
the reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out
when we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time
for little kids i think that they should have things censored because there young
it helps by knowing the meaning of new words
<person> is a very patience person
<person> and i took all of his <caps>
me for example i love working and playing on the computer
i had been in <caps> classes ever since i was in kindergarten at <organization>
another way of communication is through email
over sixty thousand dollars was spent to try and modify the buildings framework
then <person> came along and made me a somebody
it would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder
that means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family
the last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the reader knows exactly what is going to happen in the future
when she goes back to take the test shell have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test
one very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert
<person> who was sitting behind <caps> motioned for me to sit with her
with out them thing there trying to take of the shelves its going to be boring
also the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging
i say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books
i think that computers do improve your handeye coordination
not even halfanhour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on
things can fly over your head and you might not notice them
that is what the narrator choose to end the story that way
from different websites
he makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live
also while refilling he encounters hazards such as short rolling hills through ghost the terrain and ever a snake
the winds above the empire state building were constantly changing because of violent air currents
i had to get my shots because i was sick
my finger tips were icy as i sat and wanted
most kids by the age of <num> have already used a computer for over <num> hour
or they could go put something up and make it where you know whats over there and if you do not like then do go in
laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed
the next problem or obstacle was making the buildings structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles
the governments opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
she began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us
the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to many reasons and many obstacles
it was one at <person> and i favorite game we played
those situations can all put you in a really tough place
libraries are found all over the <location>
there were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face
there are more books in the library you can read
if you do not cuss and say you go watch <caps> <caps> you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word
if the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class
the computer gives you an unlimited amount of information that will help you in any report
staying on the computer does not help the situation
so i started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and i was dreaming of all the hot things in the world
it shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again
in some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed
for a second we lost our grandparents car
her birthday was in a couple of weeks
the main element in our memorable moments is laughter
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them
i felt like such an idiot
we <month> look different and see things different
what made this really funny was that his grandma was getting mad
they teach you skills you need in life
and <caps> you type in the most romantic spot in somers <caps> should come up with a bunch of spots
this creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future
scientist say computers have positive effect on people
the last reason is we had to wait <num> minutes in a line so we could get back into the <location> from <location>
thats what is happening today
but her more mentally then physically
the obstacles that the builders had to face made the idea impossible to happen
i had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw
the biggest obstacle was nature
but of course <organization> had to try it just once
<person> and i created a black teddy <person> with a studded leather jacket
also they have the ability learn more on the computer
it gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply
i love those times that you laugh so hard your stomach starts aching really bad
my dad is a very patient person
that was not possible because the city was already made below
a second reason is do not go to that library if the material in it is offensive to peoples beliefs or religion
all you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information
kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex
my <caps> was mad at <caps> cause i was so muddy so she send <caps> straight to the shower
the setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help
laughing has brought me to who i am today
she is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can
computers are a hundred percent health for you
everyone is on the computer these days
we drove into the parking lot and <caps> was no where to park
it is within our obligations as human beings to have dreams and want to convert them into reality
the offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there
my mom has to be patient because sometimes her coworkers or even the people there really get on her nerves
lets get to <location>
think a head <num> years from <caps>
seven out of ten teenagers rather be inside in the computer talking to people rather then meeting new people elsewhere
the author did it to symbolize things
so in all the games i always had to wait to the <date>
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant
i knew something was wrong
another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality
if a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured
they should leave the libraries just the way they are
now that laughter is here almost all the time i cant wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window
personally i love laughing because its a good weird feeling
my coach <person> started to talk to everyone that was new to <caps> <caps>
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
his parents giving a hand to people who need help
growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
i think we need our computers
some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie
studies performed by the <organization> know that <percent> of child who play computer generated games are overweight
now for my third reason
another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas
like raps <caps> and other stuff like it
was neither practical nor safe
the removal of these principles so ingrained in our nations conscience would cause a general uproar
i started going daily again
in this paragraph i am going to tell you about why i think that people should <caps> other things than going on the computer all night
both options are unacceptable
there will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world
it was pretty much a normal day
well if you she a your like we
<caps> again shows the love towards his friends in the beginning of paragraph <num>
he is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it
but also people who listen to that type of music might be disappointed
all the descriptions of his family cooking and family neighbors eating together is enough to make anyone feel happy
people can also hack into your computer and look at all your documents
many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive
through everything they had been through
yet when she says that she vowed
many people all over go to libraries for many different reasons
the setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict
also it takes you away from what life has to offer
we cant just take materials off the shelfs of libraries
for an inexperience driver i got anxious and put my foot onto the gas instead of the break so that <num> m
he seemed extremely sick and i remember being really scared
i was a deep fourth grader
once they finally started back up the rain started back up
so i did what she told me while wondering where <caps> were going
the last reason is because of a law
getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with samples
it had the flavor of battery acid
in <date> i show cows so that made <date> zip by really fast
there was a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas
the citizens of <location> have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong
i must do something or i go insane
lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society
some cars were old and rusty and some are new and state of the art
movies that are bad should be taken off the shelf
i cant even imagine life <caps> laughter
one reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there are lack of a suitable landing area
if somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then its their loss
it took place on a <date> midday at the beach on the <organization>
many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside
this tells us that even if they did build the mast it would be illegal for the dirigibles to land there
the author is happy that they did
<caps> was so funny <caps> took up the whole period
i was patient the whole time
something she needed at such an ugly time for her
it was my two little brothers of course
show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with
when i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind
taking the <caps> to <caps> everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life
the bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist
another reason was because of the winds
till this day i still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day
putting my learning to a stop
people need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them
it was chilling to the bone
people spend hours on computers talking to people
no parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means
i also use it to write conclusions for science labs
i disagree that most books are offensive to readers i believe that they just help the writers get their points across
my brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled
in closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home
books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something
the <time> i made <person> smile
we were all asleep within seconds
their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family
in school <caps> use computers all of the time for writing papers and researching different things
yes because children should not be reading anything thats is like that
i <caps> that i would feel a lot better if i went for a run instead of going on the computer
he was there for a wile and suddenly i had to go the bathroom
if it does my mom wont get another one
in my opinion i think that the author sets a loving mood
this <caps> like totally needs to stop before everyone is addicted to spreading rumors
this is a very interesting quote
even nature was an obstacle
<caps> should be a persons personal choice
i believe that whatever is put into the media has a purpose
computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world
personally in my opinion i have no problem with anything found in libraries today
every book has a different plot and a different moral
we used floating balls and swam from base to base
i held my little sister and gave her to my mom
<caps> was my best friend and the smartest dog i knew
so do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone
to connect <caps> with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight
as you <date> know the price of diapers and pullups has gotten pretty expensive so when <person> turned <num> years started potty training
but that does not mean that i spend my whole life on it like others
talk to loved ones or family members through your computer
she looked like if she was a part of the darkest night of the <date>
every student do the same
everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they <month> not always be pleased with the outcome
computers is the main invention that most likely everyone uses
many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life
i also had a runny nose so she said i probably had a cold
somethings people <month> find offensive others might enjoy
a time when i had to be patient was at my dance audition
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
<caps> i left and i still waited until my brothers finished
<person> had about three teeth total in his mouth
so in order to strengthen the frame it would cost over sixty thousand dollars
then everything from there was a little different
i have been offended of some different magazine pictures before
<percent> of people who use the computer use the computer language in school
he also praises their willingness to help other immigrants and stick with everyone while they create a new beginning
<caps> what i had forgotten made me excited
it was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag
this quote explains the law about airships
many express their religion by means of music and culture
if they choose to write about subjects that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries
due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast was the problems that the builders faced
it would me my first time
that family has made that their home forever
this sight was trouble
for the empire state building to take the extra load the architect would have to modify and strengthen the buildings existing framework
i think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them
one time i was really sick and i started crying because i was in a lot of pain
i have now convinced you that computers are very positive for people
<person> and his mom are on their way to <caps> <caps> <caps>
iv went out the is another place you can check to get the weather and keep your family safe
there have been many times in my life in which laughter was the key ingredient
the mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary
and that is how the author creates all the moods on the memoir
thats how the author sets the mood
and that was the time i was patient
there was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible
the choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child
i was really excited about going on the new ride at <caps> point the <caps>
opinions can cause a lot of problems
an example is the the <caps> <caps> this is a book of a <caps> that meets a young boy and the <caps> is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy
people are entitled to their own opinion on what is appropriate level material for themselves
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen
well because you can watch episodes of your favorite <caps>
its that one value in life we can cherish forever
everyone has different opinions and likes
later on a comedian went up and he made everyone laugh in the audience
one is the winds and the safety of the building and people
next he says that our neighborhood
the great out doors should be one of the best places to be
and they can teach us new things
computers have something to them where somehow the become addictive
i noticed some were young and some were older
one of these problems was the buildings frame
i showed <caps> to her just like any other time we had gone to the library
virtual tours are becoming more and more common today
<person> was a boy he lived with his parents in a threeroom apartment
i have also seen what happens when u take music off the self
third i believe its a good way to just relax
yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence
there was two hour and thirty minutes left
books have always been here to support us and every story must have some fun detail
when reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective
all of these things can give wrong ideas to our children and teenagers
every second my heart pounced until i got in my dads car at <num>
it is something that can always brighten our day
and <caps> was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face
he drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated
she enjoyed doing this it made her happy
i swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face
this can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken
he starts by going into detail about his culture of rich culinary skills
the features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him
then we found out our plane had gotten delayed
i looked at him and laughed and said i told <caps> that <caps> needed to go right not left
they are leaving behind and would do anything to give them better lives
the janitor was wiping the floor with water
my main reasons of this argument are
the last reason the dirigibles should not be moored at the empire state building was because of a law that prohibited airships flying flying too low over urban areas
you will never know because everyone has there own and who knows whose opinion is right
well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology
everything in this world can be offensive to somebody
trees also are home to many living organisms
all of the previously listed things are rated
one good thing is that you get to talk to people
they had to go get some information from the <organization> air station
computers have a positive effect on people because you can <caps> find what you need in minutes
she had already started to call my name out
so it turned out to sound like <person> was going to have his heart broken again
plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home
it is a right for the public to be able to access this material
<caps> are students in <num> grade with a <num> grade reading level
another way he set this mood was by explaining how nice his neighborhood was
people spend way to much time on computers
magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across
this modification would take lots of effort and planning
i got up as fast i could and sprinted faster
laughter to everyone means something different
<caps> book is set in the <location> during the time of slavery
that is why the story ends with that sentence
in the country of the united states there should be no such thing as censorship
its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer
this quote is explaining how using lead would not be safe
a humans greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests
laughter is in my everyday schedule
some people <month> feel that having particular material displayed on shelves of libraries is rather offensive to specific individuals
up at the desk there are the librarians
my family always does stuff together like board games and what not
now there was a time when know one knew how to read or even was a loud to read
his isolation while cycling down the shortcut was a definite factor in his strain
the author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background
the library is a place were ones mind can explore and discover as much as it wants
the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mask
her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister toys here all over the place from before
computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work
the first problem was the frame of the building
trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time
and then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us
read the following to know just how important computers really are
it never turns out good
a couple years ago i can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head
laughter was coming from everyone
it was sunny and warm outside
then <caps> and my brother told us to get on the bike and they walk
i think i should start with my blond moments first seems how thats my natural hair color
the last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with
this is how setting affects cyclists
i got so tired from being on the computer for so long i took a nap
i will myself not even to look in the crowd
in this essay i will explain why it is bad to spent too much time on computers
i never could type but i caught on because if you are having fun while you it will be easy to turn
as said in paragraph <num> the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
with four kids it is bound to happen
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there
imagine you life being ended because of addiction on computers
the youth of <date> is portrayed in mostly a negative light
one feature is the desert he is biking through
the people that use computers have important jobs
she took the open spot in the top row
finding nothing but over sized sweat pants and extra large shirts we <caps> out the ones we thought were the best
in the library i have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group
i had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before
one hundred feet never felt so close yet so far away
in conclusion i think computers have not benefited society
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory
using the computer is <caps> good to do or not using the computer helps people be able to interact wild people that so easy to talk to
my mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films
a concern i have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers
you will finally be able to look up a place you want to go
my mom handed me my plate and and i reached for the bottle of <caps>
the law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
when he thought he was going to have a dirigible station dock on top of the worlds tallest building
therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen
this would be a big problem for everybody involved
and you could also do like to the and you see people
in my language arts class we have a reading blog that every student has to participate in
one person can learn so much with a computer
about two weeks past and my uncle <caps> invited me to one of his stand up comedy shows
that is what patience
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the cool pines and rushing rivers this is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun
most people like stuff that is interesting to them and some like other things
probably not on any teams or in any clubs
the flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills
also it give a <caps> and sense of a good family relationship
it was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in
that is how the setting affected the cyclist
virtual people are not your real friends and family
that overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter
they both overcome obstacles
that <caps> without computers it will be different
those are some <money> the best reasons why <caps> a home computer is better than not <caps> one
i decided to be a mature teenager and be patient
the biggest problem having to do with safety issues
parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see
the first reason being if you found something offensive it <month> not be to someone else
the dirigibles movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building
laughter in our relationship is like glue
in my case i am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing
little <caps> asked again
he does this through his word choice
most kids use computers to learn about things they are doing in class
the point is that laughter is every where
i think people should do something els then use the computer
when people think of libraries they picture this cold place with and old mad lady telling you to be quiet
thats why computers are good
i had to wait another hour to actually do something
then <caps> cautiously asked me if i wanted to talk about it
over <percent> of <caps> have a chat account to talk with family and friends
that is why i think the people is wrong saying the or is not
thats a time i should patience
one of my earliest memories i have is laying on my parents bed listening to my <caps> tell me jokes
i was felling better now
<month> <caps> rest in peace
you could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside
this paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers
so we waiting in line for two hours in the hot sun waiting to ride the ride
if you want to know more send on
my views on censorship are strong
on are way there my sister <person> was acting like she was on the titanic she had the dress and everything
i told him he could come by <date> and that i was very excited to see him again
<num> minutes later <caps> was still waiting
laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself
it says my mother and father had come to this country with such courage
more and more teachers are using computers to help us learn
<person> was <person> girlfriend so they had some showing off to do
we got to the next window and they gave us our food
the computer to most people i know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones
not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse
i think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy
they could choose to stay away from that sort of thing
if you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you
the scenery can also affect the cyclist
there were gifts under the tree and stuff in our stockings
i thought to myself nothing will get in my way well i was wrong
another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower
another obstacle they faced as they said in <caps> <num> was nature itself
life is becoming dull
its more of a fun fact or personal note
the last feature would be the distance
if certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects
with out patients your life would be very crazy
by now you <caps> that i would like to
our zippers were tied together and thats not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom
the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways
my heart was pumping faster and faster
i think that laughing could be the shortest distance between two people
now he knows what pages to read from the science book
no parents wants to see their go through young
i was starting to get worried
they are fantastic resource with endless information
<organization> and i were having a great day because it was a <date>
he also states that he loves his house in paragraph <num>
or a person listening to hard and violent music <month> feel upset or angry
we met back at our room with our goods
theres offensive material everywhere
is <caps> hard for you to be patient
it hooked around left like the start of a figure eight
like in the excerpt i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
as you can see sometimes its good to stay patient but when you get to do something fun its worth it
they need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up
you can search places and people
there is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed
he admired their courage
my teacher told me so
there were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
like his surrogate grandparents
he or she is having a bast playing with someone in the family or themselves
the way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too
education is also a useful thing you can use with computers
another example is in <caps> <num> it says i learned there about how to love
well i have some people spend to much time on their computer <caps> completely choice
if one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out
one way the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways
as one can see computers help with handeye coordination
they find these things to be offensive
people can learn new words they never knew about
my third reason is that interacting with friends an family
we cannot let this continue
everyone takes something offensive but not everyone takes the same thing offensive
as she reaches home she is greeted by her mother
every year i have to wait for <num> days for my birthday to come
the last reason is because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed
another main obstacle is the safety reason
i can understand if you think that restrictions should be put on some things because i will agree
if you do not want your child to share this book of dreams then do not let your child pick up the book
having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun
i personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and <month> have some violence in them
i was always the youngest out of the people i hung out with
there are so many laughable moments just in our living room
i shook <caps> head off and started to concentrate finding <caps> classroom
its hard to judge certain materials because some <caps> might find it acceptable while others might not
we all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while
the heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated
i am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful
however i went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again
computers also allow us to learn about far away people and places
computers are a huge advancement in business
in conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit
safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen
one of the many reasons why i believe we should not remove them is because everyone is entitled their own opinion
she talks about how things should be taken of the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it
mainly children use the library more than any other age
so this is why i think having technology is good in our society
<caps> family did everything for love
they let <num> people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn
it should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can
in this article i am going to talk about the way libraries sensor their books
both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh
also laughter can bring two people very close together
every day i used to mark it on my calendar
it was funny to see <caps> dad pretending to be the fake photographer and say thats gorgeous as though he was a real photographer
overall laughing for me is one of the most important things a person can do to make another person feel welcome and comfortable around you
dangling high above pedestrians on the street
i remember when i was in <num> grade i made a new friend and she moves to <location> in the <date> after <num> grade
these people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day
also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes
too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive
when i was young i would always want to be read to and when i continued to age i would always read
airplanes became the future
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
but it was worth it cause i finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner
these were the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
<caps> weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
i ran over there as fast as i could when i saw the ambulance lights
take a stand and censor those books
little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn
that was the day i had to be patient
they might really like the book or whatever it is
a single cable tether
you can have a video family
she wanted to be first in line
<caps> first reason why computers are good for society is computers help people learn about things
i know that everyone is not the same and feel the same about everything
health is a big issue when it comes to computers
that is a major part of life
this test meant more to then she just failing
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
the speech <caps> <caps> gave eased us all
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast
i goes my brother is the only patient one in the houses
in paragraph <num> she states it was here were i learned the real definition of family
we can make something funny out of pretty much anything
this one reason why many people use computer
i had to wait <num> hours to get mine
always filled the air with not just scent and music but life
he is grateful of his friends and family
also you need save your reports for your school or work
there has been many times i have been patient in my life before
and she finally did get in and i was just sitting in the waiting room
but if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff
he could have also been killed by a giant snake
we can narrow down our options so easily because you can search for something so specific
the hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country
almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor
my second reason was going outside and the reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day
and was overdrinking
people should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time
we followed the little path away from the rock towers down to the river
now every time she sees me she tries to make me laugh <caps> makes me feel good every time she does <caps>
this mood is great and shows anyone can be happy
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and kind for many reasons
he figured that one would not hurt
i got really mad when i read it so i threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them
he also says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
i think that using computer is fine
someone once said laughter is the shortest distance between two people
i went upstairs to change
<caps> pat it into the the lake and dock it at a dock
the author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over
<person> found that he enjoyed the doing the play very much and made a lot of friends
the day finally came to get my phone <date> it was my <num> birthday
there is only like <num> out of <num> or <num> people that is actually good
video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression
then later that night he called me saying he will be later than i was expecting
the builders would have to keep this in mind
apparently she thought different
so the next day we went and got them and that was a time i was patient
these choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood
they sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind
plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below
as long as <caps> day can be an adventure like tonight
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one
<caps> the train advanced we jumped up and off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot
this pretty much shows how computers are not so great for people all the time
when the boat finally arrived i was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining
because the reason people read books is to learn
you have to get over it
handeye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination
instantly his face lit up and he asked how and after i explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me
the cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy
this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
and a laughter is the best way to agree with somebody else
almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it
my birthday was coming up
people can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it
<caps> also helps with work
one of those freedoms is the freedom of speech
he is also grateful to have a lot of his family members who are close to him
my mom saw that i was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in
people need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever
the reasons why i agree with computers have benefits is that
some people think were weird but if you knew us you would understand
one problem was actually docking the zeppelins or dirigibles
i told her everything is going to be alright
the whole screen thing brings me to my next point
my teacher was very sick so we had a substitute
this was an occasion <caps> i need someone else there to help <caps>
than i said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school
also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication
<caps> therefore the power of the wind is a huge obstacle
our group finally had the tape
he also misbehaves in school constantly
this is just one example of thousands i could think of in which laughter <caps> the moment
one time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs
so censorship is really in the eye of the beholder
it might create a certain image
and i had to be understanding about that moment
this for me is such a hard thing to stand
there are all kinds of different people in the world
i <caps> you see the computer the way i do
the van rolled up to the hotel parking lot
if i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back
one day i was watching <caps>
hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed
guilt also struck me as i realized how i had felt about <person> at first
everyone is titled to their own opinions
<person> had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities
tea party giggles erupt into hoarse cries as rolls of thunderous laughter echo through the room
this kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age
i grabbed my brother on the way because he was going to help me out
our teachers taught us to be nice and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same
removing books means taking away history from them
skating can be fun in many ways
we started walking around waiting to see if it was going to rain
i believe there should not be any censorship in libraries
then it would make everybody fit and health if they try
the mother would be taking away what i like to read and watch
computers maybe useful but they are over used
typing fast and correctly takes practice
a time when i was patient was when my mom broke her hip
and you can pay your bills on the computer
another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen
i sound really weird
or might get yourself killed
used hydrogen which was highly flammable and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it such a densely populated area
it makes things last between one another and makes both partners happy
if you keep it up now it <month> not seem bad but <num> hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes
they can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid
a simple laugh made us comfortable and everything was less awkward
i feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose
i believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work
laughter is really important the more you laugh the better you feel and the better you feel the more fun you will have
he shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how hes going to die
everything we see now a days is run by or has a computer
a little while later i actually started forgetting i was in line because the people started letting more of us on
he is proud of his culture the way he lived and how his parents were caring people
it also sometimes goes by what you are looking for
some of these books could be arguably offensive to some people
my family is blessed with the knowledge of seeing light in odd situations
the computer allows for quick and beneficial research
it was a close knit community
laughter is an important part in life
one night me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades
it was the worst because we shot <person> missed at two bears <person> one of the biggest bucks of my life
make tomorrow be a better place than today
the author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home
one day i was at a baseball game in <location> and the line was huge it stretch out for half a mile and we were at the end
dear <caps> <caps> i think its a good thing that people spend so much time on computers
many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer
another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the <caps> regime
and i saw how they live
i really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore
i have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive
thats when i discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards
it is very dry and hot out there but
if there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off
the mood created by the author in the memoir come in different ways
kids can use computers to find information they need quickly
if everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others
when we had finished our good byes and i love <caps> we hung up
in <caps> the stars are the most stunning i have ever seen
even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience
i know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger
a public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in
lets just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office by two days
i feel that we should all take a stand against computers
for instance <organization> had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books
like not promoting websites on so many <caps>
we all started laughing
you can also look out to nature
to make sure everything would be safe and in check
then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him
thats the time of when i know someone was patient
finally our turn so i got on and she was right being patient in line was worth he wait and it was so much funnier to get on
and that was one of the time
computers also let people learn new things
the same goes for being told what you can and can not read
another obstacle was <organization> safety
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
in the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed
another obstacle is location
some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them
the best learn about it and help
people these days are taking things way to far with their opinions
when my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities
your whole job depends on the computer and typing
a closeknit community
doing many things on the computer can really help your handeye coordination
i was at my friend <caps> house
they are not happy with the way you treat them
the author mentions several things from which one can infer the sensation of a strong supportive family that has everything it needs
everyone has a right to read what they want to read
they also allow you to do research
we would look as white as ghosts because of all the sunscreen my mother would generously apply to our skin
there are many reasons why laughter is an important part of any relationship
and were always willing to share everything they have
you can look up something that happed a long time ago <num> or <date> that was a
i think that its important for people to go outside and hang out with friends
i survived through a hot <date> and now it was time for school
<caps> was like a instant shock through my body
but as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day
i love to make people laugh
that is how grateful the author is towards what his parents did to make them have a better life and <caps> has learned what the word family truly means
the dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot
you will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the <caps>
then she finally cooled down
their is also a lot of love in the mood of the book because there are lots of mentions of family
the entire steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened which would cost over sixty thousand dollars
the mood created by the author is both <caps> and love
my other sister did not like that my <caps> was not on the plane with us yet
the issue is people was to much time on computer
i had no choice but to wait
one of the first obstacle the builders faced was realizing that the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame
i came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of
we had to come inside and <caps> up for dinner
and since they had to do that the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
they were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot
the features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story
there is only one choice and that is that computers effect all of us in a good way
if the plant was strong it would not be quivering
<percent> of <caps> have a computer at home
he had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of energy
certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there
its good to still have have books that are offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive
every <date> we would cram anywhere from five to nine people in a van and be on our way
because they are all ways to express ourselves
i believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire
but everything changed after the teacher has told everyone that it was story time
one book to one person could mean something totally different to another
he has to use <organization> to check on the stock chart
decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views
your computer must have the right specifications to play it
well some libraries want to take that concept away
now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day
not two miles into the next section
no one can say what offends everyone
i figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out
<caps> is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all
we have walked around for hours and we have spent a majority of that time having to stop and catch our breath because we had been laughing so hard
my mom had to sign in and we sat down
tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
the world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because were on computer for a long time
but you think what you want but this is what i think is good about laughing
this was an obstacle because it would be at a cost of <money>
then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else
the architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself
on the other hand the computer does have cons
also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes
another issue with this mooring mast was the violent air currents that were constantly shifting the winds on the roof
my next period was drama
the most you let your child watch is <num>
without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it
computers are best all around helpful
now that you know two ways that computers are not beneficial to society
the different sounds of music are based off generations
the great lack <organization> exercise is causing health problems
their are great things to <caps> at the local park every day
i said as my dad and i got into the line for the ride the maverick at <caps> point
another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable
<caps> did we scream our lungs out
we need to find a balance
meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching <caps>
ahead our power lines they fixed it and we got our power back
they <month> feel like they cool
whether or not you playing games or typing articles your eyes <month> strain to keep up with a small font on a website
the night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure
my auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game
in paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him
computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family
there is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public
this is shown in <caps> <num>
another big problem is the rough terrain
so i waited and waited and on and on it seemed like forever
it can encourage people to show their own personality and attract people like themselves
i wondered how i would make it through the rest my school years
i did not think i could wait that long
what ever they tell you is not wrong cause the <month> have been through it already
they teach help stay in touch and are not addicting
one obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified
they can also make grading a paper easy
or put the books some people find offensive in there own area
we can go the web and facilitate our life
one might argue the fact that it uses an offensive n word more than a few times
i remember when <location> and i would throw little pieces of eraser at each other across the room nearly missing our teacher
the wind on the top of the building made it nearly impassible to land safely
with all this patients it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctors office for <num> hours and i had to wait in his waiting room
the <caps> are playing <caps>
that one person was waiting for a call or email that was promised to happen
patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something
not just blood relatives but everyone who would do the same as them
they eat lots of food
during this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone
along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats
most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers
laughter has always held important meaning in my life
the above explains the obstacles of the empire state building for dirigibles
so thats taking the parents time away from their kids
its causing people to miss out on this beautiful nature
songs that really mean something or about someone
if your inpatient you would go look for some
the shifting winds would be a problem because they would cause the end of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast
this makes it impossible for dirigibles to even approach the mass without being impaled by other buildings
it talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast
i felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together
i finally had a goalkeeper jersey to wear to games and make great saves
the author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test
that is why the author ended the story in this way
laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams
the mooring mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building
the plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow
they should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material
also the computer can teach you lots of thing
my last reason why i think this is because <caps> really a person that you really love and need in your personal like
just make sure your happy with the people around you
my people and i went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed <num> people each
movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book
he first comes to a ghost town where he finds no one is living
<caps> teacher sat down with me and explained what to do in steps
<caps> the author saying that you can see how much gratitude he has for his parents for everything they have done for him
lastly computers are beneficial to society because they entertain us
the sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me and i had to stop and bask in the sun shine
brain damage could be a serious problem that could be caused by something as simple as looking at a computer screen
everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner
but you cant just take all the books and things out the library that are not appropriate because some people actually need the books
<caps> and i walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water
he came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head
he had many visitors
the hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in <location>
the editor for the <location> local states <caps> parents live over <num> miles away
that is all i thought about
the people who are censoring things like t
another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people
it allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them
i also agree with that
my true story is on the relationship of my <num> year old toddler daughter and i
that would be a horrible experience for a young child to have
i believe people have different views about things
it is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader
that when i started to laugh harder <caps> heck
sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them
focus on something else <num>
a thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building held by only one cable would cause to much stress to the buildings frame
she has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought
some people say computers distract you from friends when really they help you talk to your friends more
that is a time i was patient
the heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health
even if they were able to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building the cable that is holding it will cause pressure to the building
so i thought for a while her who is her
this idea of docking dirigibles on the empire state building would <caps> to be over with the invention of airplanes
this shows how grateful he is to his parents
a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
i think thats pretty positive
i also think it good research to browse people
if we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history
the second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid
laughed and seed i will never be good enough to skate and she seed that i have improved than some of the people that she knows
the reason the author was inspired was because of the flower
without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have
it felt good to smile for the first time in a long time
material with too much threat in it <month> make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen
because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state
if all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn <date> we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow
the next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went
the mood created by the author in this memoir is being thankful
the first obstacle was meeting with the navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
i disagree with library censorship
his face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him
the author is so thankful in fact that hes actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did
hospitality is one of the best qualities you need to make a house a home and the author really stretches that
this can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading
we would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying
every day she sees my smile fade as i check the mail for that one letter address to <caps> <person>
computers are one of the leading problems with weight and you are and interesting with society when on the computer
that trip was the bast <person> worst hunting experience of my life
<organization> a conducting experiment that are rigged
one way i could describe the memoir is that it makes you fell good about things
the town hills helped the cyclist
it was a <date> when i was at the park
you like to see people smile and laugh
some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life
it pushed those negative thoughts straight out of my mind and told them never to come back
we got side tracked by all the scary things i realized that i had to go to the bathroom
i sat up and looked around at them
when he again stopped later for water it was cool and most likely refreshing
it does this with the mouse you have to be very coordinated to be good at the games on the computer
it slopped downward in a perfect <num> degree angle with only a few turns
being a foster takes a lot of patience
computers have a positive effect on people
that she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i can remember when my step mom <person> was a size six in the waist
more <caps> then not kids and parents abuse the computer
i was just waiting and waiting for it
it has made it simpler to type reports
they see the cover that intrigue them
this can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like
i was about to die of boredom
and how long you can have the books for
there is no way around it
the weight of the dirigible and the pressure of the wind may cause the building to collapse
i believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style
my second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live faraway
the mooring mast was composed mostly of steel
according to a survey done by the <caps> <caps> <caps> only <percent> of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week
finally one day he got nosy and took one of my moms movies without asking
this was soon done with the help of navy and government research
i will <caps> fun <caps> are many many thing to do on the computer
not all magazine have something that can be use to educate
sixtythree percent <organization> the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most <organization> the time
when my friend who had fallen finally got up <caps> was laughing too
although i see where others come from about removing these kinds of materials from shelves
you can also use email to talk to friends and they <month> want to see you again and you can meet people that way
computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to no
first of all there are many places in the world that not everyone can go to
at first the line was moving very fast
this means if they had a dirigible tied up to the building in the wind it would put weigh on the building or pull it around
an obstacle dealt with if the dirigibles were fit to dock in the empire state building
the author sends a message to her readers when one leaves what they once had
that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again
the only exercise students get now a days is their <caps>
you could bring them anywhere you would like
one obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area
it has been <num> hours and my dad has not come back yet
laugh could change the whole world from dangerous to peace
the architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs bring passengers down to the base floor and back up
schools like mine have over a hundred computers but they are only used for education
the first problem they faced was the issue of safety
shes focused on how her parents made a house a home
what to do now let you on the computer again
it did some things that others never could
that is how it should have always been
not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people <month> find funny other people get offended by
the builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there
computers have allowed over <num> citizens to get their education right in their home at a price they can afford
well i believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library
the next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt
i think that the computer has a good effect on people as well as it being a helpful piece of technology
children read about gangs and think that it is cool
one example of being offensive in a good way is the book <person>
i know that because i am driven to the world of computers
many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger
no one is forcing you to read the material
this is what i think of this essay it will be up to the people to choose what they want the listen and hear too
the use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are
hanging out with the family is something everyone should love
i believe censorship is necessary
another fifteen minutes passed
this makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat
if kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun
the stubborn side of my nephew was showing its ugly face that morning as <caps> fought every move we made
two computers are good for you in many ways
the author created many types of moods in this <caps>
<caps> just like talking but with either pages or instruments
thats not what sum parents want you to hear
anything i could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me
the greatest issue was the wind
we stayed there for <num> or <num> nights
there where many different moods that the author created in the memoir
<caps> brought me happiness every moment i was with her
id like to hear that my letter to your newspaper was read
all of these activities require very good hand eye coordination
i could not find i had to go on a computer for the information
the wind at the top of the building are very strong and would have swiveled around the mast
a man <month> find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him <month> find the book funny and joke about it
to prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars
this would not be possible without computers
exercise wont do that at all
he relieved because he can get something to drink
this made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there
this is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person
i believe that everyone should laugh on regular basis
the cyclists tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water
the only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
the features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways
people will get to addicted and be lazy
except one ride the <caps> we got there before the crowd came in
there was this trail we would use to walk back to my house
so before u judge listen to the whole song
it was when i was on my way to <location> to see my family
there are many different styles of literature and media in this world
we had a fun time because good humor and fun kept the <time> alive
we were finally ready to fish
we would not have any books if everyone removed the ones the disliked
thats what i think you should for now
the only place you can find a giraffe is if you go on the computer and search a giraffe
she had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs
<person> tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog
the same moods came everyone that was mentioned in the memoir
people today are spoiled
i believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today
<caps> is for children under the age <num>
by not allowing kids do do whatever they want and showing some authority lets kids around the <caps> know they need to show some respect
people are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement
some people might think that computers are a waste of time
they are in better moods throughout the <date> and affect people around them with their upbeat mood
i strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness
so in the future the mooring mast by <organization> did not work out
also your bills will get higher
i mean in sounds corny but <caps> can happen
you get facts reviews about the place
and helped me move forward
i think that computers are great
<caps> <person> went down stairs to play his video games
he was so proud to have parents who cared so much and had such selflessness
materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people
the main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area
i feel that censorship in libraries is not needed
i even asked <person> to ask <person> if he still had feelings for me
it is a challenge to find why samesex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true
my mom asked me if i wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there
when <organization> finally finds her <caps> she is in the checkout
i told her i wanted to keep going and so we kept walking
the dirigibles for example
i feel censorship is a waste of time for the government
two minds are better than one
some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it
parents <month> think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that <month> be considered bad
he had his arm around me and whispered in my ear i would never let you <date>
when i got home my dad asked who brought me and i told him my sister went and got me and took me out to eat
none of these books really seemed offensive
the mood created by the author in the memoir is courage
when i first meet people i am very shy until someone makes me laugh then i am very comfortable
while reading this many people probably became more appreciative for what their parents did and provided for them
she wanted it to come but it did so she was mad for a min but the next day it came
i arrived in town <caps> be very disappointing
there were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway
the features of the setting very much affect the cyclist
did you know that patients are one of the key to happiness
<person> especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them
therefore people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families
also the winds at the top of the empire state building were too strong
they believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing
patience is a key role in life
to and if they cant find the book they want they might start crying
from there dirigible passenger will board from there
well this pretty much sums up what i think about library contents being censured
i all ways say that we are one big fake <caps> family
a book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life
my parents stand me in my house as they use the computer
my arm was hurting so bad from it
i thought is this <caps>
the factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist
censorship is when a person or organization in authority does not allow people to see things that they believe are inappropriate
in the world there are today there is about <num> billion people
the people who spend their day on the computer need to change
i was losing my patients
so when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test
in this part of my life laughter was an important element of my whole life and it still is a great part in my life
the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
i believe that libraries should have a censorship
i know i was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out
so computers lets us do anything and everything
i had no desire <caps> impress anybody
school libraries are a whole different idea
even if that person is miles away
the most apparent is musical instruments
but every time that we did it we would end up cracking up and forgetting what we were even fighting about
this was a problem because the winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building releasing its gases
thats why i think we should keep computers in this world
everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in
they said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain
all of these things in the setting affected the cyclist
it was around <num> am on a <date> <time>
another reason is because of communication
some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is
i have been wanting to go here for years
it also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house
a to give him a better life
it was so unexpected and i felt like a child
also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents
randomly <person> and <person> run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to
the author made the relationship very close from everywhere
it is a good idea to learn how to type fast so if you are lets say writing a story for school
i still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property
a <caps> woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid
everyone needs to have some sort of patience
patience is a very important quality in life
when we finally get to leave we walk up to six seater phase for us to fly to a small island near by
the author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder
another health risk is obesity
<person> does not listen to his mom at all
should them magazines and etc
they would have to make the empire state building strong enough to have the wind blowing around up on top
keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves
you could of missed a year of stuff
i was having a pretty hard time dealing with it
he then to the negatives of a computer
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
it took long time to get a phone call it felt like it took a country
finally we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other a little better
they would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation
also if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on <date>
i thought i was the richest man in the whole wide world
people say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying
for example if you are doing a project for school
computers benefit society and have great effect on people when they are balanced our with other important things such as exercise and socializing
some might argue that though
this shows the mood is all about love
i knew this who played video games from about <num> foot away for long period of time a day
i never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching
another reason why i think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone
it effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology
the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water
genre comes in all kind of different types
often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that
i was the last one to go into a stall
the effects of computers on me are very good
where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself
when he finds the bait shop hes relieved
only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since
the mood the author <person> had in the memoir was grateful
to be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in
laughter between each other is what cheers you up if your having a really bad day
the mood he has set is love and kindness
kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to
the movie situation i understand
honestly i thought i was the only kid who lived the way i did
and also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it
they have made a great deal of positive impact
the computer is often used for projects essays which is important
the material is not serious enough
when he came to the first town he described it as a ghost town
so now i hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computers
completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing
there were many obstacles the builder of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
if one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves
the electricity that runs computers of this radiation
if the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water
this paints a glorious picture of what <caps> life in the house was like
i feel that if you tell someone that they can not do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more
like this if you have a problem with the things around you such as taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them removed well sorry but no
i could barely sleep that night
so no need getting mad over it
in one book that we read this year in my <caps> class was <caps> <num>
my last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running
a feature is something specific about some thing else
so it was a very good mood the <caps> wrote the <caps> in
with the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them
one day when we were fishing for <caps> head and it was not going very well
<person> tells me he has done nothing wrong
it is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next
he said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop
out of all the things that need to be censored the library is not one of them
one day my sister had a volley ball tournament
his family moved up to <location> before he was born so that their children could have a better life
people get offended by things everyday
its where you have <num> people
then i was waiting i was waiting
i was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared
<caps> in line started screaming at each other except for me
they barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence
we need computers like we need water
i lived there a couple summers <caps> i know how hot it gets
and each time we got bites but we never caught any fish
i believe that the book or magazine or <caps> should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it
we are not the most well functioning family
laughter is a funny thing
i let them tell me what they think would look better or would give more points
wind on top of the building shift constantly caused by violent air currents
it was the day when we were going to get our dog <organization> and i was excited and as patient as ever
rough roads did as well
the rest of the <time> the conversations flowed much freer between me and <person> and it was a wonderful evening
so by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain
mostly because i find the most idiotic things hilarious
in conclusion i think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad
its a time period in the past and it <month> be something a high school student is doing a research paper over
no they <caps> not use computers more
i have experienced these things as well in my life time
<person> gave me a look that said tell her the joke and <caps> him a thumbs up
laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people
this means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not
one problem was that the blimps use hydrogen instead of helium to fly
laughter really was the shortest distance between two people that day
it should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated <caps>
the movie the <caps> they should not let kids watch that movie its not a movie i would let my kids see until they was older
the mood of this memoir is very happy and loving
having airships dock at the empire state building was potentially dangerous as well as illegal
it was <date> <caps> and i had just started dating
it brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader
<caps> society today loves laughter
safety was the biggest concern at each stage
what <date> be offensive to one parent <date> not be to another
i had never seen her so concerned or upset
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
so i parted her hair and put it in two ponytails
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
most of there problem they encountered when designing the mast
<caps> rooms are the main why
and for which i am eternally grateful
because of computers people are spending too much time on computer and less time doing things that are better for them
everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs
also it would not matter to me if i walked or drove or rode my bike to the library
it could even locate a wounded soldier
now imagine if we were able to stop that
there are a lot of positive and negative things about computers
finally after four months of doing this i did it
the author of this memoir created many moods
so i got up and went to the room <caps> directed me in
i believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see
i actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf
which made the builders procedure illegal
an obvious one is love
the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist
<caps> <caps> you found the <caps>
we were accompanied by another family with four kids
i got every thing i wanted and i want a load touch with the <num> <caps>
the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast
my friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework
eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly
everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others
a certain amount of time can be plugged in
the biggest issue he faces is the weather
then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen
<date> that day i was driving home from the store with my <caps>
my coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves
so has been around for a long time and still is being used everyday and always will be
some people are with technology that they almost get addicted to it and use it every chance they get
he became dehydrated
it would not be fair
we all knew <caps> was time
i feel that technology can be both good and bad
now they cannot ever play the game for it might cause serious brain damage
i suggest that you will agree on my opinion
<person> started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room
right now he is six months old and i love when i see him
this is why the mood created in the memoir is proud
this is where computers come in
so now you see computers are a vital and useful of daily technology we have at reach
after that was taken care of the builders still had other problems
for example they can see pictures of men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example
i believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat
people are different like different things
and the way she talks to her mother
he says that the community was all a different race but they all became a big family that got through the racist times of the united states in the <num>
many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive
would you rather use a computer or be in <location>
and the reason why i feel like that is because i passion for computer
i like <person> said <caps> pushing in his chair
i know i do instead of being home on the computer
on paragraph <num> it says countless extended family members came and wentand there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet
they are there to provide all kinds of different information
he called out smoothly
once upon a time there was a young girl named <caps> she lived with her dad and mom in a small town of <person>
one of their main obstacles the builders <organization> was the frame work
this is why it should stop because it damage peoples minds
one day i was going to my friend <organization> <person> house for her <num> birthday party
these are all the reasons why computers are bad
or they might just give up on it all
an example of this is in paragraph <num> where it says the u
i had a wait for <num> minutes
young children in todays society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials
the author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change
a time when someone else i know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job
this is my third reason why children should not we spending more time on computers
an you cant just take that off the shelf
<caps> will live life longer
my moms addiction is laughing
a nice man said in a kind friendly voice to <caps>
if other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves
hope you enjoyed i am not a very patient person very rarely have i been patient
of course i was upset i was furious
it is our responsibility to keep the good influences around and keep the bad ones away
the mood created by the author in this
four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road
another obstacle to its construction was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
what are we going <caps>
too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing
papa <person> had asked if we were okay
i would like you to put the <caps> in the <caps> and hear what people have to say about it
can you please find my suit
and i got to play football
what one parent feels is very offensive another <month> feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn
it was just a bad day
he talks about the small little <num> room house and explains how his parents made it home like
another reason why they <month> have these connections its probably because its a better way to see one another if you live in different parts of earth
libraries and all types of media should not be censored
another way to communicate is by video chat
the cop was really dumb
it was <num> and my mom and sister come walking
it would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off
giggles filled the school for hours
that is why the memoir has a happy mood
some say it is the best median
and then we have no books left on the shelve for any of us
i have a few reasons why this is a good thing
one of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist
out side it was about <num> so we buttered up and and headed at
it also says that they learned the real definition of family
we should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves
we <month> starve ourselves to try to be skinny
many well wishes and tears were exchanged between the day they had departed
the kids that we have to look out for is the ones in elementary
paragraph <num> has a feeling of caring
secondly computers help people learn new things
more than <num> out of <num> people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal posted on them
famous singer <person> says
if you get rid of movies from the library then people want be able to have a visual aid as there alternative way of learning
the quote laughter is the shortest distance between two people
on by the way another thing is long car rides when i have nothing to do
and sometimes do feel
the outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting
they help you with things
i <caps> what that is like
computers show these advances greatly
a final example is when the <caps> states i learned the real definition of family
i was not very good at it but it was fun
she hopes that she will be able to start her life over again
the things you can do like play games
one of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety
for some its watching t
when in a library environment people tend to be more and more on task
to stop yet another generation from messing up their lives taking the materials off is the best solution
i believe that computers effect most people negatively
talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes
as the is days went by as it get colder we started to see some does
books and magazines should be allowed in the public library even if they feel offended
the features of his journey are cruel
after the disaster in new jersey they did not want to take a chance
in conclusion i think computers have a good effect on people
never in your life have you seen an <caps> <caps>
in conclusion these were some out of the many obstacles a dirigible had to face
she then kept cycling and saw nothing
i thought i was going to cry
offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result
computers are helpful in everyones life
then she finally answered the question
personally id prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer
i am going to be writing a time when i was patient
communication is one of the main reasons people use computers
the scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned
the <caps> obstacle was the building itself
they never take that to look at anything thats going on around them
then a lot of people came over
<caps> why it never could happen
if one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant
the kids we saw <num> years ago were on the right path
parents need to be <caps> for their kids
he thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart
society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not
it is how they express themselves
another reason is because its a good hands on eye coordination on adults and students
along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake
then it also turned into a serious and none joking around madder
legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock
we never had the best relationship because she was always gone hanging out with friends
kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all
so about these bombs
thats all we needed to start up conversation again
they always had the arms and door wide open to other refugees until they got back on their feet
the ticket came up to
i saw my mom whisper something to my brother
another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air
the memoir also shows this mood of graciousness for the understandings his parents taught him
they also help you to get ready and not be stock in your house on that nice day in <date>
the author brings our the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely
these were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
the <caps> sets the mood in the story as paradise for everyone
its those brief seconds with another human relating to you
<caps> is quite a jolly kid
then we finally got there at about <num> pm we had to take a little train to get there
children get hurt from doing <caps>
the <caps> can helps in <month> ways also
he creates a loving mood when he said he lived in a closeknit community
also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing
there are lots of stuff in book that people <month> think is offensive
the mood created by the author is a proud mood
learning about things you have never dreamed about learning
i think the mood created in this story is love
<caps> information in books can take so long
then i learned about <caps> <caps>
the winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents
doing this would grant the people who wish to see this type of material access to the material
another obstacle is they figured out that the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose
i have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of
computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much
we were just laughing up a storm
one obstacle for example was landing
patience is when you are waiting on something
the author said that he would never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things he learned there about how to love
we were about to leave when <person> hooked one on his last cast
the freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes
why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school
there are some cases that a victim of an accident recovers with the help of computers
they had to pay <money> in modifications on the <caps>
you can lose your real friends
but i have to say shes mostly grateful
successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle
it makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more
it was last to go to wait over my dad to help understand it so much more
what even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened
this was in response to the first town he came across
as you can see computers are very important
i went to the edge of the floor
censorship would just be the start
we stayed out a little past dark and just walked around <caps>
these are about computer how people spend time on them
patience is when you wait for somebody to do something
you can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a <organization> agent
they are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers
everyone had their own right to get and see the things they want
there got another hour
the teacher made us play a couple games where we had to introduce ourselves
in all of my relationships i have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal
another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians
so if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about <caps> or know where <caps> came from
the next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles
and i truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across <location> has something to do with it all
first he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking
its for your own good
<caps> statement was from <person>
the greatest obstacle they faced however was nature
i said just do the homework
life would be very hard without them
so you make the choice
then he would ask my brother be like you know i got this money for my baby
they live in a beautiful house that has <num> bedrooms
you have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to
well i agree with them
in all relationships laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handle
he said i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
some of you might think computers have misleading information
this one time my brother and i were coming back from <location>
their happy because their all a family living together as one
communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble
one time i went to a carnival with my dad
i asked what was wrong and then <caps> asked if anything could ruin my day
one day we were both just having a rough day
there are many ways to approach this question
the mood i think the author created in the memoir was love
this type of material should only be given to an older audience
many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us
and let the army do the work
your not the only person that thinks that way
the mood the author created in this memoir is very happy and relaxed
nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them
she was gorgeous so i was attracted <caps> her immediately
they have to exist with the affected the cyclist
there are many people that think that the lyrics of those songs are just terrible and offensive
i know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things
it seems that the more you complain the longer it takes
when i got in the car i could just tell by the way <caps> looked that <caps> was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun
<percent> of <caps> kids are overweight and that is unhealthy
finally the computers can teach handeye coordination
i am also a cheerleader
its a very undesirable feeling
anyways <percent> of <location> is obese
after that day it was no longer a difficult process for him
it also has many games that and learn our vocab words
the man got to see his newborn baby and his wife
the wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i was patient and i got what i wanted
<person> and i locked eyes
the six year old that cant keep a secret
he grew up where he had friends or family to have someone that they trust
if everyone limited their time on the computer we would all feel a lot better and be more social
<caps> is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills
we live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do
if anything were to go wrong with the ship many people would be put in danger
theres even a to a science website
due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves
they are seeing a picture not the healthy
the mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one
music if it has an <caps> sticker you have to be over <num> to rent it
then comes the rough road ahead
this feeling also adds to the mood because of the appreciation shown
and if you have been there then you know how long the lines are
the man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water
computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication
the features in the setting of rough road ahead affect the cyclist
i guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride
he looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today
i hope that by the end of this letter you will see that computers do benefit our society
i have this story to prove it
my dad was so mad that he kicked the only log that kept the <caps> from rolling away
he creates this mood by describing the atmosphere of his home
its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that
computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as <caps> or <caps> they are also a way of communication
these are my reasons i think computers are important and positive to people
my conclusion is that you cant please everybody
the rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions
some <caps> would sometimes want to know about certain things that is offensive
since we got in the <caps> it their was nothing but laughter
on our way home we had my ipod out and the volume turned to max so we could listen to music and dance around
music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects
there are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship
you can look up certain workouts that you might want to do
this was very hard for me because i had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench
many obstacles hindered the loading dock on the empire state building
do not get to close to the screen because <caps> can hurt your eyes
i strongly urge you to take action to start reduce time on computers spent
the answer to that question is easy
the motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before
some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project
they believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids
so practically shes stating once everything come back to life then shell feel like she will pass it next time
i hope you take this letter consideration
well if one person has a right to something then it would only be fair for the other people to have a right for the same thing
censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries
simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone
the author does this for several reasons
these ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place
there one of the greatest inventions
i was shocked my cousin had so much patience
college is important because it has a big role in our life so we <month> earn great jobs
the features of the setting affect the cyclists mood towards the journey
there are only a few that i named but every age group has a specific spot at the library
the setting affected him emotionally as well
they first needed to make <money> worth of modifications to strengthen the building to accommodate this new situation
computers are making people unhealthy
the actual docking was impractical it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch
with all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation
i could not believe my eyes
you go on the computer
the author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life
in the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with
i hit the metal fence and simply fell over
i asked him when i was going to get it
thats why i consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored
then i set down in the food store and i looked and so my friends coming into the food store
censorship can be used to block ones personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism
one of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe
they needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building
without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time
held by a single cable tether would not be stable enough to mount the dirigible because the building frame would be stress to too much
the faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times
came together in great solidarity and friendship
<caps> struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior
safety was a big issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there
this is an amazing piece of work
<caps> sat in line and about every <num> minutes the line decreased by <num> people
as we walked <caps> seemed kind of worried
there are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff
his parent found out that he was addicted to this game <caps> of <caps>
this quote shows <caps> family took care of everyone even thought they did not have much themselves
having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not
at least <percent> or more kids are obese from recent studies
<caps> we got more stuff and it was <caps> full that we had to get another cart and it started to get hungry
the author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year
its a experience that every <organization> <caps> dreams of
<caps> glance at me and i turn away
i had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him
because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind
i pushed him away and continued to watch the movie
laughing is actually a element of why i am in my relationship with my boyfriend as of right now
only seconds later did <caps> answer it with a big smile across her face
thats exactly what i did and i got my game
another problem builders face was nature
one day i was so excited because it was <caps> and my friends and i were going trick or treating
<caps> took a little while but <caps> was my turn next
or you can chat with complete strangers from around the world
it covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about
the story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end
none of us had had dates but we still managed to have the time of our lives
so they both agreed that is would be best if they just stay as friends
she has dated many guys since <person> first asked her out
i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink
i believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening
the building of the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was very poorly thought out
the empire state buildings frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast
stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes
we drove from <location> to <location> and it was a long ride
the architects had to go through many obstacles such as having to rebuild the whole frame of the empire state building
you eat dinner and ya just want to unwind from the days gigantic adventure so you go on the computer
so he was affect in a lot of different ways not just one
in the short story rough road ahead
the speaker is very grateful through out the whole memoir
but i am going to tell you about a time i had to be patient at an airport
we all started laughing to point we all cried
since we had gotten all warmed up we decided <caps> sounded good
maybe its because i wanted to try to cheer myself up
thank you for your time
anything put onto paper is legal
everything seemed as if it was going to work out
then his teacher asked a question to the class and <person> had thought in his head that it was the one of the best answers
learning about different cultures can teach us many things
it never fails to make me smile
it was a very hot and sticky <date> day and cedar point was packed
most of these issues were safety problems
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
because so many are at an weight it is costing tax payers millions
when they are reading the children expand the minds and also helps them with everyday situations
the material being called offensive just because of one persons views in not rite
the feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist
i disagree what people say about computers
this means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke
<caps> brother is attending college at <organization> and since we do not see him often
i knew then that this was serious
one obstacle was the stress on the building from the dirigible
therefore you know where you want to book your next visit
censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world
god i thought how long can this take
a computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination
<caps> when we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and stepped into the waiting room we seen <num> people
so when we left we had to leave fast so we were not on the the road for a long time
the author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home
a cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere
<caps> example you heard about the <caps> that happen in <location> by t
so that was the time that i was just patient
one of my friends was a victim in that and it ruins you
here are some reasons why i think that computers have good effects on people
ill never forget that time
<caps> quote has greatly influenced my life
sometimes life can be so cruel
but it is true the opposite way as well
were all different even when it comes to this
libraries are fun to go to
it would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools
the whole time i was on the side lines
she went to her sisters house
if your eyesight is already damaged a computer will worsen it
the back of the ship would swivel around
next computers help us with our school work
when they had no idea when to get inside and how to protect their food
also abandoned buildings
<caps> is very difficult for some kinds
kids visit the <caps> all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too
by a dirigible docking it would be directly breaking the law
then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up
one day her time will come for her to bloom
recent research from <organization> says that <percent> of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computer every day are over <num> pounds
the mood changed into a slowed kind of mood and explains why he is grateful for all of it
most students use them every day
waiting for like <num> minutes just for people to finish a test
also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time
his description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness
the line was as long as having to <location> itself something told me it was going to be a long wait
<caps> <caps> nothing is funny just laugh
you can communicate with your family or friends via computer
certain materials should be removed from the shelves
all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
well a friend of mine used to go outside everyday went outside to play
history in books can sometimes even be offensive depending on someones lifestyle or background
laughter is important for so many reasons
i believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want
i believe laughter brings many different people together
they can experience the <organization> lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold
when i say hangout i mean we hit some mud holes and played around a little bit
this goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored
they also solve geographic problems
he said it was going to be another hour
the first challenge the builders faced was that of nature
he felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left
books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror
having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable
wiser people than myself say that life is short
video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest
people who thinks that the computers is a helping thing to use but <person> said <caps> people learn much easier from family of friends then from a computer
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
as i walked in the room the first thing i saw was <person> beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye
weekly popcorn servers would hand out stuffed bags to all the kids as the class read aloud
<caps> sat on the couch then and told me about how <caps> was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays
but thats not all a computer is good for
another problem with the dirigibles was wind
the books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life
if this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge
a library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred
i think laughter is a great thing in life
music is a different story however
trying to build a mooring mast was not a good idea
ha i wished laughed my pa as i started up his truck
its a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost
the dangers are always there
well my time is up here
so i rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race
she is always in need of something funny
computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society
you <month> be thinking that we just do it for fun and that its enjoyable and nothing wrong with it
a test done by <organization> showed that teens will rebel <num> times more than usual with the aid of a computer
we talked a few times but his voice was different
since his parents did this for him he has even become a clothing designer
for some reason my dad and uncle thought it was so funny that they made her say it over and over again in a rime
i was laughing so <caps> that i peed my pants a little
so it just depends on the situation
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock
the next day my mom sent me over to my cousins house <caps> a sleep over
censorship also happens in todays media
i felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what
there is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples moods
that are found offensive to people
without books we all would not know what we know now
also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date
i have my eye on you
one main problem is safety
just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement
the first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills
it is his own writing style
the mood in this memoir is love
it is a huge step up in the education process
i still said laughter is the best medicine
its upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents
it takes you away from your kids family because that will start to fill as if you love that computer more then them
they affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains
in the memoir the author has various moods
shows deep feeling towards nature
he was grateful for many things like love for cooking and grateful for his parents
<person> told me that
this shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there
no book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries
people need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone
we both loved it and really wanted to watch it the next morning
the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
she has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she wont grade it
they are also good because they help you communicate with friends and help people make plans to do with friends
she probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world
another obstacle that was faced was a law
we got out of the pool and walked to the deep end
a struggle that was faced during this time was that dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen which is highly flammable
hood below the infamous snow dome
it could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that
the author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in <location>
one day when i was patient is when i was waiting was waiting <caps> <num> to come out of game stop
when building something always be prepared for obstacles
this quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all
<caps> and children need to get away from their computers
he then felt a little disturbed and worried
the computer can be used in many ways
i met a lot of new people that were all the same
thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation
its our free will to pick up books we want to read
last example is if your teacher says find the book about the <caps> and you go to the library but everyone is taken but you have one by tomorrow
i personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to
and by looking at the censored things thats not helping at all
finding builders with these traits is as easy as understanding if they bring you joy or not
the library could get in a lot of trouble
stuff like that should not even be published in a public area
the effectiveness of these winds was shown when the u
<caps> we gathered the blankets for the stands we left
it is a right to be able to obtain the information theses materials offer
the features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him
the next to quarters went by and it was tie game <num>
when they got to the house <person> was screaming and crying they all got in the car and drove to the doctors
at least i had bounding rime with my mom
very mad i kept saying to myself its the best ride you can wait an hour longer so i did
he explained about how peaceful and grateful his
you are the complete opposite of everyone here
struggling financially and personally
these are a few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the empire state building which prevented the use of the mooring mast
because books are like atoms
he was helping his <caps> made his birthday cake
i would have to say that they are good and bad you really cant pick a side
they also have maps to guide you through the way
there are more bad things in them then in books or music
computers are wonderful and let us do so many things that we cant do by ourselves
most of day it will be fun
there was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city
the reason they are in an office or living room or bedroom is because people like them and uses them for their needs
so one day i was at home babysitting my little brother
as it states in the writing prompt it teaches handeye coordination
well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather
<date> computers have become the most helpful source of technology
they make him think he will die and overall make him worried
music is the same way
other people will allow this chance too
heres why i believe this should happen
now you think we should do about computers
we have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age
so again we sent the guitar <caps> hoping that we would finally get the wright one
history is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious
people who spent hours on the computer live a sedentary life style
it shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it
overall it was too far fetch of an idea
i was not able to focus on my breakfast because my mind was full of thoughts and questions
then i was keeping it moving
this quote means that his parents mood was careful and do anything for people if they needed help
that does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though
computers are a great source of information
thats is how much i was laughing
he also saw the <caps> grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions
to many things were predictable
that is not safe because if a blimp caught on fire at the building there are 102 floors that could burn down
there was only one other person there a drunk man waving a beer bottle around and sitting on a log
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
so seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone i got most of the other volunteers to help me
this problem needs to stop and be addressed by the police
computers teach us and sometimes can guide you
i see a tiny computer chip
the library is a great quiet place to get your work done
laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways
i put my back pack in front of me in order to block her view
in <caps> time i had the money for my <caps> bike
guess what the libraries have some of these compact discs of these artists that are played on this radio station
not being patient is just disrespect
people are offended by many things every day in life
it all added up for a great night
the lake was quiet today
they played video games instead of cleaning and mom got mad
i was happy i run out side to wait for my dad so could have freedom
but overall the mood is sad
<caps> they had to modify and strengthened the whole thing to accommodate the new situation
he hardly noticed the sun was beginning to beat down
i could hear impatience people all around me
i think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be
laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things
a third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself
well in my family when cleaning music is blasting no matter what kind it is
my first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world
in the memoir he say that he would never forget how his parent turned his simple house into a home
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was happy
most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe
the can talk to other the world
the third issue was that there
how you draw it back
there were many risk when landing the huge dirigibles and also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas
as you can see i have told you as much as i can about patience
if he were in a different setting like by a river or spring he would just stop and drink from that
people have different beliefs
without doing anything but sit back and lip sync
she was very depressed too
you could send a letter with the touch of a button with out having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply
this creates a mood in the reader of being home and warmth of family and love
and i feel that yes i do have a right to remove these books from the shelves
the day was beautiful and full of happy faces
the architects came in contact with many problems
in a recent study the amount of families with computers is now <num> out of <date> compared to the <num> out of <date> in <date>
then our grandpa starts yelling and trying to figure out what the heck went down
computers kept our relationship healthy and i do not think it would have been that way without them
in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run
i would say laughter is something that comes from the heart
it would be a would far different from our own
but i had too wait till everybody was gone to go get it
perhaps we will find nature more interesting
one example on why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called <caps> tales or <caps> the <organization>
builders of the empire state building failed to recognize the dangers of the mooring mast
telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out
but the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society
the greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature
one laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze
libraries can have an affect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be
people will start eating too much and so they will become lazy
my view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles
if there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life
you can also watch movies or <caps> shows that you missed or want to watch again
i have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content
most of the best moments in my life have usually involved <person> in some way
in the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of <location>
so the <caps> books and magazines should stay on the shelf
there are not as many people taking care of our planet
the affects on them are that people get learn things easier
i believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children
the next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other
without imagination what fiction would there be for children to read
its an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong
winds on top of the building were constantly shifting
my last reason go on the computer your viruses connected to it
removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech
later in the relationship is where laughter came into play i was laughing all the time when i was around him and not upset all the time
the author had so much admiration of his parents strength and perseverance
the biggest challenge was the wind above the building
shes saying by next spring shell take her test
everything from books to movies were put in the libraries for educational reasons
typing is also another advantage
computers can entertain you with games
another reason is that some of the books or movies etc
that was time a person i know was patient
because of these reasons it made making the empire state building a landing area unsafe
once all the cars are gone <person> informs us on what we are doing here
then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone
even if that particular book is telling you whats right about the topic
computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge
ill tell you what it is
we were supposed to get on the cork screw ride
some of the great classic novels have contents that could be considered offensive to many people
i hope you agree with me
continuing on he reaches another building
computers are very convenient
its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more
but with the help of my computer i can interact with them all year round
to risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating
i believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them
thanks to them you can always stay caught up with the latest episodes of your favorite show
most of all i thank my friends for shoving me into him that day
i told the sub the kid needed to get it but he said no
this <month> include learning about people
i am going to discuss a patient and being patient
the heading on the document said <caps> <caps> <caps> <caps>
but <person> waited to play box <num>
so thats the time i was patient with my little brothers and sisters
also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject
another problem was that most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather then helium to inflate there dirigibles
and also set and stand by the age limits of the books being checked out
overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost
he never talked to the rest of us on our street nor did we attempt to strike up a conversation with him
you need them to see how you are doing financially computers are essential to our <caps> and economy
when i was fourteen years old i think my family and i started riding four wheelers out in the sand
but it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf
i think making areas where children cant go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people
so i close my eyes and imagine something really nice
adults and children are spending huge amounts of their time on computers
one the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker
<caps> me and my <caps> do not like that
plus there is not a bad book that your kids will find at school any way
t hen hop on another bus then get off and go shopping
i go on the computer to to my friends and check email and stuff and then i go outside to play
other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled
a smile on her face good job <person> you got an a
the project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area
for example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much
everybody uses patience sometimes in their life
people everywhere learn from books
almost every city in the <location> has a public library
many people believe that computers are positive towards our society
i am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him
some people learn on computers
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there
when she was done and left we waited and waited
occasionally my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be a handful
but this problem was fixed by strengthening the buildings foundation
we could do tests on computers
patient is an important <caps> of your life
magazines are often picked up when going into the check out line in a grocery store
literally almost anything
however in trying to do this the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
it can even help you find a job
i believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library
computers have a positive effect on people
we started to become really close friends
after all toughs years had past by my mom and i managed to get our legal residency in the united states
also i have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve
this show is an example of what could happen if you become exactly like her
books about drugs are alright to an extent
i laughed until i started to cry
<person> was very patient in his basketball career
that when they came to <location> and <person> could afford to move into a modest threeroom apartment
but he was unfortunate enough to land on his face
one little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen
this is <caps> way computers can change your life
if you pay attention to how you are around the people you like the most you will see that most of what you do is make each other laugh
maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time
you can also to see a love one that you miss
<person> did you practice typing <time>
if that same accident were to happen over the densely populated area of new <caps> it would be a catastrophe
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below
they went in the plane
without computers people could not learn
nothing good comes from making people feel bad
the younger you are you can learn more about the stuff
the <caps> of <caps> gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind
when the rough road affect sign appeared the travel then become more difficult
the authors memories make the reader feel warm because love is heartwarming
and you want to go and see what it is so you can laugh too
we have to step up as the life goes
i set my backpack down so that i could look for my daily planner
this can help people understand computers
patience is hard for some people
it could be a <organization> website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future
after we were all tired from the running around we decided to make scary movie with my moms video camera
<caps> said <caps> your father and i have to pay bills and buy food
by computers affecting this many peoples lives is ridiculous
this is how the change of setting affected the cyclist
it can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste
when we are together its fun
everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny
we had to wait for a half hour to ride it once
in the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding ill be prepared enough to take the test
i think <person> was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin
pay bills for long distance calling
books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them
children now look up to these song writers and want to become them
this is how the workers of the empire state building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there
one last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas
but it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home
the confident team we should have been from the start of the match was now prepared to win the <date>
my head was in the sky
<caps> actually pretty ridiculous
if you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you
it can be more helpful than you could imagine
this would add stress to the buildings frame
<organization> screamed like a little girl and we all laughed really hard
eventually people started leaving
memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer
i think everyone should laugh at least once a day
the book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it
i started to ask myself of other possibilities
<caps> hated the fact that they drill into your teeth
until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone
she wants to take the test again change to see if over time things <month> have changed
not one you would want to live in i suppose
families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities
i looked at him with a why are you laughing dad
in the <date> we were together constantly
on <date> we left to go home
there is really no comparison
<caps> seemed to have taken days to get to <location>
i mean imagine the world without laughter
but most people spend to much time on the computer
these kind of things affect our every day living
long distance calls cost money and it is not worth <money> a call if you call every couple of days
some people go to the library just to see them kind of books
one time that i was patient was when i was saving up to buy a game
another reason is teachers and parents use email to talk about academics and their children
you can do all of that stuff if you just get off the computer
we waited <num> hour for a <num> second rid
conversations over a chat system are fast and effective
i just stood there with the dumbest look on my face
these are some good pros
he is also grateful because his parents gave up almost everything to provide him with a better life
one feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat
i was very patience with her
learn from my words i as <caps> give up keep trying
with the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of <location> where they type every day and work hard
they also made there house feel like a home for their son
he had no where to get water or food
not only because she had found the castle but because she learned how to be patient
i waited in line for <num> hours on the mantis
and thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer
the cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years
next is that its a great current learning resource
although handeye coordination is mainly taught through the powers of the computer
people are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material
one day there was a girl named <caps>
everyone has the right to have their own opinion
if he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer
you can research people and places and or get pictures
<organization> had gone and told <caps> that we were friends
so if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him
i like getting the full effect out of things
this law stated that it is illegal to fly air ships to low over urban areas
my <num> year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children
thats the time i had to <caps> patient
your screen fills with choices of information sites
one of my favorite story about <caps> was that he never liked to swim
it was right there within walking distance
these magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation
with the <caps> you could learn a lot
i wondered how she could just let them cut like that
i feel no we should not take our learning form our babies
if your on the computer for <num> hr
she is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in <location>
but most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you
cutting down peoples availability to their interests will only lead to frustration
this made the mass unsafe
since the computer <percent> of tree cutting has stopped
it was during it that had changed his mind
computers help people around the world to connect with other people computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world
so i believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read
kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home
the mood of the memoir is actually happy and grateful
happiness was shown throughout the story
the students poured into their seats as we scurried around behind the curtains
he lives in <caps> and i live in <location>
i felt bad so i had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood to not be mad at my dad anymore
she loved the way it made her feel
computers have a background of doing this kind of effect on people
when it comes to computer they have saved many people life
some of my friends spend <num> hours on the computer a day that they could be playing
thank you for reading my paper local newspaper
mop the floor with his opponent
there should not be any banning of books
she decides that she was going to over comes its obstacles just as the flower over comes its obstacles every winter
one of the greatest obstacles they faced to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was nature itself
because laughter is a big part of being happy
how hes always had a good life from when he was a kid to now when he is an <caps>
these books are usually the ones that teenagers read
i sighed and put a pot of water on the stove
by being on the computer it helps teach people handeye coordination
she never spends time with her family or friends
three out of five homework assignments are on the computer
to this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate
also there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas
they can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility
i believe that censorship in libraries is wrong
we would have computers but we wont use it like for along time then spend more outside
these dangers effect every user and their families
in that time you could be spending time with your precious little girl or even the best friend out side in nature having fun
but they would never say anything to the library cause they know that i will be hearing these words all the time when i get older
that was one of many car rides that was amazing
we were not doing anything this was probably around <num> in the <time>
one obstacle was the wind at the top of the building
she had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country
the five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call
spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels
it is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way
without computers theirs no point of music
you need a computer if your teacher require you to type things
we sat there in silence for a short time while <caps> chose his words carefully
limiting or censoring the mass media we have in our libraries would nearly empty them
it was a chilly <date> morning and a little cloudy
just do something that involves being outside <caps> is so much fun
we get up round <num> am and turn on the <caps> tree
she discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time
now that you know that lets moves on to the conclusion
the dirigible plan became more and more unreasonable with an accident occurring in <location>
that is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock
and we can be able to post games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans
we went on the court and the ball was served we let the ball hit the ground point one to the other team
the setting effects the cyclist very much
instead you should keep working hard until you get it
at last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives
there are all kinds of different genre of music
another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas
the <caps> <caps> is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs
the rest of the day was alright
the <caps> stop them and by the end of the first half the <caps> are down
i have one because i like to chat with my friends
they should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable
the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal
in this quote is love
the noise turned out to be two cats fighting in the street
this how computer help people talk with others around the world
i was getting ready to wrestle and i seen <caps> warming up across the gym from <caps>
i sat on my desk and did not know what to do
in our league out of the seven other teams four are in the top ten in the entire state
<caps> was just as if we had taken up the life of a dramaridden teen straight out of the movies
the taking away of these books takes away the freedom to read anything you want
but they can still be in there because some people might want to read them
she told me about those first days and how scared she was
there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
it was here where i learned the real definition of family
one last example was that he was lost
in conclusion i believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive
this is why most endings are meaningful like this
together the plant the hibiscus
lastly we will have many friends
the story was about a little orphan girl who had to go live with her mean relatives
sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination
to more on i will explain what i mean about being with family and friends
children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways
all these times i had to be understanding
this affected him because he had no water to drink from
lucky me i was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie
some people <caps> find ways to get those censored as well
there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library
so in ones opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well
i only told one person
the features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story
i have learned that playing or using a computer call help victims of reflex damaging accidents
another event during that day that i used patient was to fell them asleep
there are other things that can keep two people close together
this is how i feel about this subject
that way she gets hope from both
these criminals prey on kids
most <caps> should be enjoying nature instead of staying on the computer
you would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape
please keep reading to hear more about why computers are good
this whole excerpt is thanking them
finally the time come to go get the tickets
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
<caps> mood in this memoir is enjoyable
no one can say what will or wont be accepted in our society in the future
if people began to take away options on reading materials some kids <month> refuse to read at all
you <month> find something offensive but it might not be to someone else
computers ruined my life
causing me to panic effected her to be at more of an ease
he <caps> that <percent> of his job is using a <caps>
that aspect of her life always made me feel a little bad for her
the struggles of one person <month> be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow
we bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store
that was really funny
this ending also shows how much of an effect the winter hibiscus had on her
my second reason is that people go to inappropriate sites and watch inappropriate videos
we worked it like no other
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
not and old one because it can breakdown
my mom came in the room and said they were suppose to arrive on <date> but since you were patient they came early
the ending also gave the most meaning
i wrote this paper to show how powerful laughter is in the world
in <caps> <num> it says his community extended a hand to people who were clearly in need
magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out
<caps> thats my reasons that the computer is good for communicating
one example is the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof
it was a great day got to wear my new swim suit and got to also play with my new floaty toys i got
<caps> brutal reminder brought my attention back to warm ups
we laughed so hard i cried
maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop
she almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it
now just yesterday she was born
it still makes me giggle just thinking about that <time>
there <caps> play and have fan and make many life long friends
like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland
his report card is unbelievable
children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did
in conclusion the builders of the empire state building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock
at the time my cousins were living with her
you could have been apart of those memories
there are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist
she had failed the driving test
this is not the case
this law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building illegal and out of question
if you have a email teachers and people at work might have to email each other to handle business
then talks about delicious foods and great music
so he took a compass and poked her in the rump
instead i <caps> email
she was to and was so excited to be able to drive
movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view
certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason
you can also do your homework neatly on the computer if you have a messy handwriting
now before i go on i just want you to know that i have been driving since i was about seven and am usually a very good driver
more and more people use computers everyday
they come once every year
the directions called for a fourth of a cup of lemon juice
they deserve more attention than a machine
people are not experiencing the world outside <money> their computers
i hope you too heed to my advice
we should not have the right to take anything off of a shelf
she puts in examples from the story that could help find these reasons
everything we did together was perfect
at higher elevation the wind is much more powerful
this was a significant difficulty
computers help you reconnect with people
when <caps> waiting to call someone i am tempted to call them a hundred times
many people have family and friends that live far away from them
that someone should just look at the other way because a library is for the general public
in <num> grade i hit my wrist in a door and a wall
the parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item
we walk all the way though the lobby <organization> followed the signs till we got to the park entrance
wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air
in he was very patient about it to
most of the time i hung out by my self
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride
you can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power
they keep the <organization> students reading and growing
i then decided i would take a chance and try for this team
and maybe change a couple scientists mind
books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world
the mood created by the author in the memoir is in my opinion pure happiness and love
most dirigibles from outside the u
they will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
i remember one time when i was patient
another obstacle was just nature itself
thats <caps> attracted me most to him
it can also help you study about people that live far away and that you wont get to meat in person
you can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live
<caps> beat him at a game and now <caps> mad
the features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers of doing it
her baby sitter became her first friend
she really wanted to go to the park
fresh air clear your mind
nature was also another obstacle itself
the <caps> creates a mood that makes you think about your self and your family
are promoting it basically
<person> and <person> were so excited they ran to the line of the ferris wheel
when you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written
also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old mens direction giving
then i will take the test again
there is <caps> <caps> just to name a few
if people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere
with the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again
lastly the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship to unstable
thats a total of <num> years of life waste
another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas
<person> mom say sure
books are another thing that could use some censorship
getting rid of that is just another loss of information
i have felt this way multiple times
laughter is how me and her became friends and classes is what tore us apart
we laugh when we talk but i want him to experience the laugh he has yet to have experience and i know one day for sure he will
the idea had too many obstacles to overcome
if we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist
most people that use computers use them to talk to friends and other people around the world
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit the setting affects the cyclist in many ways
if you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary
i was with my best friend <person> and her family
proving that something that might be offensive to one person <month> not be offensive and maybe very important to the other
this was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too
it was the quintessence of happiness
the geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go
i know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but i think computers have a positive effect on people
this also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again
a lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat
in the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his child hood home
in the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer
sometime the teen is persuade to leave their home and neighbor hood to meet the other user
he said that there was the scent of life and love in the air
we learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed
<caps> something that <caps> commonly said
if so had done it affect thous
all of these obstacles made the transportations a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared
find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it
gentle breezes swept through the trees causing the leaves to dance
set it up for only your friends to see
this is one way computers benefit all of society
this is difficult because he states the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips
people these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be
you could probably call it a clown <organization> if you wanted to
reading about this just warms a persons heart
people who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant
he was mad but he got to hang out with <person> the whole time
we started brainstorming
people always joke about him around him
the setting of do not exceed posted speed limit places the cyclist in a life threatening situation
and waited some more
i was as patient as can be
also i would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it
some people connect with books in a way that others <month> not understand
studies show that over <percent> of children use computers for some sort of school work
the author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and that she needs to do something about it
if your child wants to grow up and be a fireman you do not tell them that it is offensive to people so they cant
my sister got a fruit punch
it all started out at my aunts birthday party
with that <person> mom left and drove away
most perfect days in peoples teenage years are in the <date> beyond the stress of school
this is a very black and white problem against allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
the libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
now i will move on the my last reason
finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them
the computer is also helpful for research papers
computers effect people in so <caps> positive ways
shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults
this is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media
i started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend
the <caps> says things about the older gentle man throughout the story
the class was told we are doing dissections for about a month and it has only been three weeks
we all understand the benefits of laughter
in my opinion i think that computers have nothing to do with people having lack of exercise or sleep
we have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race though books
my brother <person> went back to his room and put spider man into his mini <caps> player and climbed up the ladder into his bed
then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say
the biggest part of laughter that has contributed to my life is having a relationship
it is very hard not to <caps> when someone else is laughing
this is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people
the best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine
these are some of the obstacles builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there
to second and one of those thing is a patience
the setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways
i landed in <location> at <num> pm that day
while looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past
second is it could possibly drastically effect literature
i turned out that their short cut was wrong
there were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
she was absolutely convinced it was the cake
there is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness
i not all that smart but after i think about it for a few min i finally under stand the joke
if all those people are busy let them do their work they want for need to do
a close family friend of ours just bought a computers
one obstacle was that they kept trying to make the building higher
my shoe was right in front of me and i finally got to it with burly anything left
you could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was
confidently i approached my second turn
i understand his music
<caps> the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym
i mean yea i read articles from magazines but like i said mostly listen to music
almost anything published or shown to the public went through a computer
the story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her home where she no longer lived
there were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i feel bad because i let something so little mess up my life
so in this passage the mooring mast by <organization> had to overcome obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
most students find reading to be boring
<caps> is also <caps> of his parents
by far i would <caps> to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties i <caps> ever had
or even tack a nap <caps> are examples of staying patient
so throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting
a knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him
the empire state building was built as the tallest building in the world and even today still remains one of the tallest
the same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music
parents have to set a good example for kids
it all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in
<caps> look like a <organization> that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate
the author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired
we waited for about <num> minutes until the <caps> came and called us in
we were astounded of how many people were their
ever since we got that mile stone in our friendship i knew better how to be more open with other people also
it also depends on whether the person has gone through in life
they need something to listen to
there is so much good stuff about it
that is why computers are so helpful
i think the books should stay on the shelves
showing the temperature was rising
that is why it was smart to end the story like they ended it
there have been studies of how laughter can heal the body
comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name calling is appropriate
libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves
but sarcasm can be blown off like it is nothing
the possibility are endless on the web
architects and engineers talked with experts about the equipment needed to build the dirigibles
whenever i come home from school ill go on the computer and talk to all my friends
books <month> even be inappropriate for little kids
we laughed and laughed
when i went deer hunting with my dad i was patient
for example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words
used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat
that is why people use computer for research
and you honk your horn
to me i think every thing should stay
it gives a deeper look into information about these things
the following day he was allowed to work on the <organization> computer and got three pages <organization> notes
this helped in my future
all this happen when children are not being watched or get bored and to pick on someone
<caps> was reminding his dad about it all
another time we had gone to pizza for my <num> birthday party
neither of us were asleep but i had no idea what to say
the library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of
so in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus
that was the day someone was patient with me
these computers are an advantage to our learning and knowledge
your <organization> computer is to do many things
i say this because instead of going outside
waiting for a laptop is not the only thing i had to have patience for
we had to wait another <num>
another snag was the winds on top of the building
the same goes with informing
you can have your own censorship in libraries from your individual freedom
this helps people stay connected
those three factors made the mooring mast neither practical nor safe
if they cant get any suggestions on what they should get they should just what they think is interesting ignore the offensive parts
finally when we went are own way
i was tapping my feet running around etc
i went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there
the builders would have to pay <money> to fix this problem
the second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is offensive and what is not
i remember this moment so clearly in my head since it concluded our entire vacation with each other as family
well the first time i came face to face with laughter was when i met my boyfriend for the first time
the water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality
censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass
you can also build new things
some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things on library
i also recall <person> sliding down to join the battle
libraries are stocked filled of all kind of reading materials
my coach told me to stay on the bench this game because i was the hard seen <caps> player on my team
we realized we had lots of things in common
another challenge the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their was the lack of safety
this is not a books fault or the evil computers fault
to start off it had happened about some time during the <date>
sharing a <caps> is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving
these practical reasons called for the idea of the mooring mast to be diminish
no one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition
he overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views
laughter is the true story behind human relationships worldwide
if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in <caps> people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated
you could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way
i do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store
the road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time
it turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life
i would walk all the way home in the dark to make my point
something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that
my mom says computers are one <organization> the most hardiest tools in the world
but i have a heart of gold and i feel like i should share
almost <percent> of people in other countries be very lonely because all they <caps> is play on the computer and forget about other people
i think that everything thats in the libraries should stay there
thank you for your time and i hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter
some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people
we need to change this habit
but after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it
its time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people
in are case we have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries
it gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and i can relate to that
he was happy to have others come into his apartment and sit down and act like family
he then proceeded to thoroughly kick <caps> butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game
no one thinks the same thoughts a hundred percent of the time
people have a right to do what they want
soon you will become fat
the mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family
the starting five for each team walked out to the center of the court for tip off
some people might not care about the things they see and some do
some people might even find this paper offensive
we put on our swim suits and jumped into the bath tub together
this year i felt as if i was old enough to ride the big kid rides which i had never done before
just keep that in mind people
the mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving
it was here where i learned the real definition of family
in addition nature itself was an obstacle
some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive
another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still
burn the average person between the ages of <num> and <num> spend more then <num> hours on a computer
she seemed so quiet and sweet
and if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed
i also think <caps> can be had for other to a and
i do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf to where a kid can grab it
i take dance lessons twice a week and when i can
never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends
there was a limited amount of water in the bottles
in conclusion laughter is an important part of a relationship
it is all about choices
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
soon the new guest was over much more often
i believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph
i helps us get updated on current events shows things that we want to do and shows us how to do it
when we found out the time for the second flight we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in
these are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library
most people even eat in their room so they can talk to people
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
i <caps> have to you like and that <caps> why we send every one of them to school <num> of every year
it was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated
she is going to overcome the problem
very come and steady so he is patient
they help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about
a time when i was patient was when i was in <num> grade and i had to wait to play football till this year
the features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist
the law has not passed yet and has remained in schools
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when <person> and i would have big tickle fights
he did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town
some obstacles were that there was many sharp rods on surrounding buildings and so if it touched one it could pop
parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading
sometimes it is very offensive and it is almost hidden from view and have to spend all day looking for it
computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us
it was also dangerous to have them land there
<caps> always been burning since the worlds been turning
<caps> not you should go to the park
nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have
you can go on sites that you on your <caps>
i am able to understand how thirsty he is
when my brother and i were younger my dad would always put on funny masks and do funny things to get me and my brother to laugh
being patient <caps> a great trait to have
the author of this memoir created a mood about family
<caps> she came up to us and asked me to bye her some <caps> fries
<caps> irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone
<caps> people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist
one important issue was the mooring mast
this would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway
another obstacle they faced was that the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
yeah we might be getting lazy but it makes peoples lives simpler
i hope that this letter has proves to you computers effect on our society
this would not be good since he is doing a waterdepleting <num>
<caps> off we go back inside hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate
it was about a one and a half mile walk
interacting with people is very nice and touching
books have been apart of every single persons life as soon as they learn to read
people cant always be reached by phone
difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends
a good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the <person> books just because they use the n word and some people find this offensive
the actual building was a problem too
this helped her learn to type
letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over
the winds on top of the empire state building were constantly shifting and if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mass it would swivel around the mooring mast
they tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried
the author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love
winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face
he is happy is parents worked so hard to get him to new jersey
most <caps> are lazy
the mood is happy because it makes you feel the love he felt living with his parents in that home in new jersey
my dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes
the second obstacle that got in their way was the wind pressure
the mood created in the memoir is a happy and caring and also sometimes sad
the last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships cant fly too low over urban areas
last reason is it can help you be organize and get a job
history has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful
<caps> explains the positive things about his home and where <caps> grew up
one of the moods of the story is love
you never know what people <month> need to hear
by sending a letter it can take a while
<caps> of all he talks about his family and the love they shared
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast
when we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard
one obstacle in the docking of dirigibles to the mast was safety for the people inside
nothing is causing obesity in <location> them computer
you can also meet new people from different countries and become their
the delivery man tells <caps> that would be at his house in fifteen minutes
its because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago
i have been patient everyday in school
this shows that he was energized and happy
if the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business
the environment is a hostile one for a cyclist
here are the ways he creates it
<caps> uncle with through a lot
we need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives
then the next day when jack and his little brother were hanging out after school everything went well
even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know
when i was patient i remember writing an article at sea world when i was very little
first i think people should not be staying on the computer all day
but if we get rid of all the censorship then it denies people knowledge
the weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw
books can also help children to escape from every day life
in conclusion working hard and <caps> give up its a part of our life and its up to our selves to overcome failing
everyone was leaving and right before i could call my dad he was already outside the door
also adults like to check websites for the news and to catch upon sports
if television was censored then people would not know <caps> to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before
i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke
i want to go on it though
the greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety
and be patient until we left
also due to a law against airships flying too low the dirigible would break that law as well
it is almost like hes with me
i am writing this article about <caps> using the computer more than an hour
<caps> was no stopping us from laughing as hard as we could
those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make empire state taller
computers are not worth <caps> your children at
they get older you wont be able to tell them want to do or want not to do
it was my parents making funny faces that made me explode in laughter because i could not possible hold it in any longer
there stood <person> with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips
they would want to learn about places before ever go
its rude for it to be there
using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world
i had to go to this one place to get the flew shots
maybe your reason is as simple as reading an email that made laugh so hard you cried
<caps> i was already there
you should start to check there homework instead of them just going on there <organization> and forgetting all about there work life i did
this is a very twosided subject
i made a hand gesture telling her to come in
because they can get over weight
the first obstacle was designing a landing area
thats why at the theater theres different rooms for different movies
on his new computer <person> can do all his projects and homework on <caps>
the cyclist had to go on for miles <caps> seeing anyone or anything
my parents and i know that happiness is what drives us to good things
you need to use your time wisely
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i walked out of the room and me and <caps> went and got the baby <person> her first dress
one big obstacle is that the dirigibles were a safety hazard
now he way <num> pounds and he is only <num>
the reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist
offensive material should be removed from libraries
the mood in this story was security and happiness
i listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life
censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn
when her plant starts over then so will i
laughter could also mean the beginning or ending of a relationship
the <caps> section has music which teens listen to
my speech was about uniforms in school and if i agreed with them or not
it to took us <num> hours to get there but we said forget it we were in <location>
now i am going to tell you how everyone has computers
there were a few compartments in the jeep that i began to search through for <caps>
i tried to hind behind my back pack again but it was to late
so as we head out of town i am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive
when the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope
the whole purpose of this writing is you have to be patience in life
we need stricter libraries
one reason is because adults like all of that stuff
finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world
those are the reasons i believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph
after school kids usually do homework or go out with friends
she can make me laugh at the most ridiculous things
its to do school work and talk to family
except right when i got home i fell on the deck because the step was icy
this was held together by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the buildings frame
you can learn about many different cultures
they made it to the finals
not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not
they teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience
one last mood is appreciative
another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas
another problem was working with nature
that would make her sound smarter and get a better grade
a major problem was nature itself
to begin with i feel everyone should admire the libraries
<caps> ate a couple of fish and slept
many people just simply take the ideas of others the wrong way
we have had seen censorship in our history
the author says how he cant put his grateful feelings into words but is completely in their debt for taking such a big risk in coming to <location>
for others you might have to wait years
one day my dad and i decided we would go fishing
all of these thing are the definition of family
laughing by its self lets the couple have a better beyond with each other
we planned to stay there for a month or so
for example <time> i used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me
me and my cousin got in lots of fights on that vacation
spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy
people use libraries as a source to see these works
the computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment
as a whole <location> is known as an obese country
why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses
because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate its no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends
objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while
that you will never meet in real life and wont socialize to the about there life and to hang out with
<person> told me if your on the computer for <num> hours on the computer for <num> hours straight your eyes can get worst
we were both in our freshmen year of <organization> <organization> and we both loved band
it has changed the way we do almost everything today
she used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair
another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader
another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town
we try to help each other in any way as possible
and thats all that matters
there are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below
the whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors
we learn and understand at different rates
the goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns
since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs
and sometimes the girls joined in too
for example you can practice typing up essays and other work projects
everyone has there own taste
doctors show that <percent> of people that spend time more than <num> hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision
the heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance
he said ended up forgetting about here and there
if you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend
the obstacles the builders faced was mainly safety
<person> sensed that i had no clue <caps> <caps> was talking about so <caps> continued
a lot of people left so we ended up being in the front of the line
looking back at each other we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at <time>
the shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book
one day <person> and her mom where going to watch a movie called <caps> from <location>
but most of the time i sleep
the team was tied in the <num> to <num> and it was the <date> and we were still winning
my body was <num> years old
in a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school
she is the most adorable little girl in the world
i have not found one thing in our library offensive to me
if i were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine i would suggest you to take it off the shelves
this means that any little spark inside the dirigible would send it up in flames
i also use the computer often
these are some examples of how the <caps> describes the mood
he thinks the heat will kill him
where no one is able to get things out
these technological devices have enabled to us to get our work done in a timely matter to receive the grade that we deserve
they talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team
you cant even name one
suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read
i shared a room with my two other cousins and <caps> stayed in the room next to ours with my brother
now is the time where our technology advances
books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing
they usually stay up all night playing games or going on <caps>
nature itself was also a problem
jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
failing her drives test was hard for her
it is loving because he is talking about all the close relationships he had with his family and friends
that young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see
the mood of this story is very inviting and peaceful
on the website you can talk to your friends
instead you can type it quick and use spell check
after the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms
i knew that that was the only place that i could actually recover from <caps> was happening
i could have never have asked for anything better
<caps> was not a pity clap
children do not need to be around those kinds of books
now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites
people are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important
laughter in many cases has brought people from an absolute low selfesteem to a high selfesteem in a very short amount of time
i usually sit there and end magazines
today was the first day i was patient
i was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask questions
magazines also are sometimes good because they teach good things and keep you updated about whats going on around the world
my brother and i were laughing so hard we teared up
if someone comes across information that would be offensive they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is
it was uncalled for to begin with
mostly any job along with sports requires handeye coordination
this is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers
these advances in computers can also allow people to learn worldwide information
many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos
a majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap
a lot of people use a computer for fun
they will majority impact your future and impact all people in a bad way
wed be different people
<month> be waiting days for your teachers to come and give your tests back
he was arguing for an half an hour
this shows how people were always coming and going in this home
that was the time i felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer with the people i love
these obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the empire state building
in the story he said this place might have been a thriving little spot but <caps> it was a ghost town
after he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut
<caps> i spoke too soon
the idea presented itself to be inconceivable
censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of
he checks it out and goes home to watch the movie
<caps> dad walked in the room because of all the noise
not only has <caps> made me the person i am but <caps> has brought me to all my friends and the people i love
while the builders were trying to droop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
it was the end of the second <date> tryouts
there was a kid named <person> who was always very patient
a lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them
poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced
these three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the empire state building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast
and three because it helps us updated on what is happening in sports or everything
i had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away
nothing could come between any of us
there are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them
the excerpt states the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened
they might even like it
in the results of them not reading anymore
then in paragraph <num> the cyclist comes upon the traditional definition of a ghost town
having someones trust is sometimes hard to get but if you get it from the very beginning its easy to keep but also very easy to lose
because she saying when the <caps> grow back she will be <caps> to take the test again
i was actually surprised when <caps> walked up and started to talk to him like he had known him forever
he said he was trying to be as patient as he could be
it really has to depend on what the product is
i do agree this is the case in some ways
so if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic
we were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life
she thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing
an example of one such occurrence is in the short story winter hibiscus
finally they were done
i was even more nervous <caps>
she is not giving up on it
libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction
especially while we are young
do not exceed posted speed limit
every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they left the classroom
people are different and we have a right to our own opinions
that is how patience rewards you
there was me my mom and dad
also growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood relative
in the end we all have our rights and we use those to choice weather to read or listen to certain material
some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something
i have a lot of patience cause i sit down all the time and help people with their problem
but i told that it was cool that she did so i told her i have to go and we hanged up
these winds made it simply impossible for this to happen
these condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge
most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age
their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason
because if you take out one you should take out all off them
alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important
i had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block
most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive
this law made it illegal for ships to ever tie up or approach a building in that area
so i waited for it to get over
the setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards
communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it
what are some of your feelings about computers
i did all my research on the computer
the features affect the cyclist in a big way
one day my dad and i try out wait in the hospital to get a trip replacement and we had to sit and wait in the waiting room <caps> <num> hour
so they both knew that it would have never have worked out because of their age
patients is something not everybody has
part of the reason is because they rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book
another day that he was over just hanging out with me
how great things were
one obstacle was lack of a suitable landing area
i deal with it and put up with all of this though
laughing is a huge part of most everyday life
music has been with mankind since the beginning
every human is entitled to freedom of speech
take all of that into consideration
it was great because it was right on the computer
the use of censorship in their society
my stomach felt like it was going to explode from all the laughter
no one was around because it was the desert
without technology things would be so much harder
it always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know
music is especially one to do this
for my great grandmas <date> we were planning a surprise party
i feel the computers is contributing to the problem
another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age
if think the author did a very nice job
and that day was when report cards came out
i did not laugh at him
that wright will keep coming until you cant even move
i think that computers do benefit us
when i got to the doctor i had to wait in a room for my name to be called
so when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot
its simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library
it is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around
so the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles
this is not the way to go in <caps> society
everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it
what <month> be offensive to one person might not be to another
the architects knew that the large mooring mass could not be simply placed on the building flat roof
children all around the world find themselves wandering through the library every day
turned this simple house into a home
the next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things
soon they told <person> that <caps> would be having a little brother or sister <person> was very happy
all of my friends and i laugh all the time
the most popular right now is <caps>
the book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished
<person> grabbed his <caps> fishing pole and marched his way to the edge of the dock
that is all i have to say
in this show there is warning label stating only be seen to children <num> and older
there is more foul language in music as it progresses
she made me laugh with everything she said
computers are not the way to go
its teaching them different values and its teaching them that since its in a library it must be okay to do out in the community
last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet
<caps> admired his parents for their strength and perseverance
used hydrogen which is more flammable than helium
they have recent events that happen around the country and around the world
computers are like a pencil to a student
so he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside
she was my other half
the third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities
this quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride
the government and society does not have the right to decide what people take in
<num> which is parental guidance or <num> and up
they show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it
<caps> this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs
<caps> mom was driving down <location> <num> driving home
nobody likes the same thing
i agree with that statement
some people are easily offended and some are not
his physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well
the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
its almost like rewriting history
this can help with someones job
her name was <person> and she told me that she moved here last year from <location>
also there was a law that stated the air crafts cant fly to low to urban areas
i also think the computers are helpful by talking to friends or family
simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch
they do not stop playing it because someone <month> having different feelings about the movie
so therefore its not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it
<percent> of the <location> goes without physical domain for at least a <date> and a half
the computers have gone to far now
a lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier
exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future <location>
we were in her moms room playing with this huge exercise ball
in the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created
now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet
computers could help you get a better future
<percent> of people that use the <caps> almost everyday are students
the public thinks that kids should not be exposed to music like rap and hiphop
some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop
all of these things affect the cyclist
however most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear
teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but <num> out <num> teens surveyed at <organization> admit getting that exercise
she is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home
my cousins live in <location> so we were going to visit them
all she could do was laugh along
then he left then a stone went his throat
and they should if the parents dot want their kids reading it
we hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other
last but not least you could just enjoy it
it was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it
the problem is that people are spending hours on the computer each day
we could not find anything to do
the computer is one of the greatest inventions created
i think the worst is liking people sign about killing people and raping kids and all this and that
the author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme
and when your done you can invite them in for a piece of cake
if he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be in the story
our food came and we started to eat
some of my favorite movies are funny
an then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
spending time in nature is that particular persons
laughter is an important element in your life
many people were family to them
it is wrong to make fun of or joke about people
the obstacles the builders faced in building the empire state building were nature
but what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books
the last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas
this would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast
you can learn about new things like people and places far away
there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen
my opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive
the safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use
i had thought that i would be in front
they might be playing on educational game on the computers
the feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey
it is live todays <caps> spend cover <num> hours per week on computers
the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting
take movies as another example
his body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground
i screamed to <caps> as sound of his poorly maintained engine bellowed in the <time> sky
music is something everyone can relate to
i always become impatient waiting for <caps> to <caps>
another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place
i hope you take my letter and into consideration
we all enjoyed it very much
not everybody is true over the computer
this made me wonder why they would do this
also it would be the best choice
also to get pictures
one time i should patient was when i friend same thy that i wanted for long time
it is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants
when mom get home i hand mom the gift and realize patient come in handy when it comes to waiting
after a long fun party it was time that we cleaned up and put all the garbage away and the cake in the over so no flies would <caps> to it
like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there
the social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world
i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway <caps> without paying a fortune in money to go the <caps>
that was the time i was patient
so get off the computer and hang with your family and friends
there is a chance to move on <caps> there is hope
i made a risky choice
he could real me at each time
imagine just driving in a car for <num> hours just driving and stopping to use the bathroom
the setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist
every time i would hit a <caps> i would get whip flash
computers are one of the best things that has ever been made
talking to people world wide can be a very useful thing
none should be denied
i believe thats the most we can do
another obstacle is they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
the thunder nearly shook the ground
the problems that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the issues of safety
its not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories
both teams were all ready to go
another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story
water is the main thing he should have
my friend <location> answered the door
there is no adequate legal definition of offend
so <person> and i sat there and waited while he was in the restroom
so we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done
that was harder to think up
he also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were
i was taking one piece at at time trying to make sure that the pile would not fall on me
my mom woke me up because it was time
there are also websites where you can talk and connect with other people who share the same interests as you
if you are at the computer for <num> hours at a time your eyesite will pay
<caps> i moved around states i had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever
i leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox
and all the trouble it puts people through
they should be replaced with educational things
but if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group
i sat in the snow frustrated with my performance
when i walked in the clinic i always fill sick and tired
i support the advance in technology especially in computers
the relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people
in paragraph <num> he says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the computer can give you plenty of <caps>
the reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because
and computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people
computers are one of these great benefits
this is seriously <person>
the author proves and says how we as grateful
i could not believe what was before my eyes
i was so happy to be there even if i do hate weddings
as you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages
this was a hard task for him to overcome
how laughter <caps> laughter can be a huge help when going through difficult times
i have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship
in a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read
<caps> kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention
one is the the person might never come back to that place
i was getting picked up early from school because that night i was going to the <organization> and <organization>
it makes them feel good
a case take action to stop using computer <num>
there should not be censorship in libraries
s use computers more than textbooks and get high test scores
advances in technology are amazing
most dirigibles from outside the u
the mood created by the author in this memoir is a warm and happy one
what some people find as offensive some other people might find it not offensive
my cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot
that is how <caps> even came to be
these are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with
another <caps> is that the wind speeds were so much greater in the top of the building that it pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station
when building the dock for dirigibles
the school board did not even care though
i feel that it is the persons choice of what they want to read or watch not the books or movies fault
libraries are a source of information
the cyclist was pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along
everyone can use the computer for communication with friends or family
if you already notice
it just depends how sensitive people are
it could start a huge city fire
he also thanks them for his childhood
the words definition of family demonstrates that he is thankful for them teaching him what family means to them
to get the job done that has a long process you might have to wait for an example i have to have <caps> all the time
the beauty of the outdoors become forgotten
this is why it should stop it hurting are environment people are becoming lazy
they used to have fun at that house
are people today spending to much time on computers
<caps> we were both getting excited because we finally found something fun to do
in this essay i will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions
our laughter filled the room
a text a and <caps> football scout said every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers
i was happy the next day
we had to take <num> stops till we got to the <location>
i believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society
they could drop out of school early and live their lives as people who cant learn for themselves
we were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me
there are many fun websites made for everyone
the final obstacle is the law
we all make choices in our everyday lives
the features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally
i see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music
it is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad
the book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views
i believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother
the kids parents have friends and family over for dinner
so basic computer skills are important for people to have for new jobs and common ones you see everyday
her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean
the conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up
<caps> looked up at me quickly
computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society
they have become more popular than the library and text books combined
another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water
therefore since hydrogen is flammable they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area
my little sister was supposed to be born on <date> twenty second
hung out downtown for an hour
i walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs
neither was anybody else
the adult must be <num> or older
this is what i sad in my head that means i need to run
then i played sports after a had my coat cut off
but sometimes computer are bad because when people go on web sites to chat peoples can be grown ups but talking to little kids
another obstacle is that the dirigibles had is that it uses hydrogen and helium which is highly flammable
you save time and money on gas by doing so
censorship has become a bigger deal in this day and age
which you just type what you want and click
these websites can get a person to be willing to be on computer instead of exercising and staying healthy
every now and then some body around you in your life needs some laughter to cheer them up
it puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy
people want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin
many people needs to read them and see what they are about
the answer would be in the streets of <organization> where pedestrians could be harmed
<caps> purple sleeping bag will be perfect for <time> said <person>
my uncle lived there so since he always came to our house we were going to his new house
if all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers
it should be remembered that it is the <caps> responsibility to censor materials for their children
most of us use to just know each other and not really were friends and never talked at all but now we all do
having an open mind will let the so called offended person see a whole other light being shown on why the offensive material was even created
laughter plays an important role in everyones lives
we talked a lot about our summers and about what news have been happening in our lives
as i mature i find out more and more that patients is important
we asked our coach if it was almost time to start
my great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died
i get off a block or two away from my house and then i walk home
never the less the <caps> <caps> is the most watched event in the world when it comes on
children need to be protected from materials that <month> hurt them in some way
we cant take something away from the people who love it just because someone is unhappy
scary movies are not real and some books too
so we just walked around
he had to save as much water as possible
i believe they greatly benefit society
it is almost like a medicine
so the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous
you could help if you want it to faster <caps> answers
i even smiled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well
that is one word i do not like <caps> when its something i really want
i can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh
that is the time i had to have patients
everyone has it and its the coolest toy in town
in the past <num> years many people <month> have gained a lot of weight
in conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction
i was so sure that i was never going to get a chance with him until i got his number
theres gore for a while
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature
like its some sort of competition
the narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly
nine out of <num> schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine
<caps> relationship with <caps> <caps> is full of jokes
one issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building
one reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people
possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds
censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect
you can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book
the author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain
but the problem we have today is patience
items like these are meant for adults only
i think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere
the more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke
since i was the youngest i was also the shortest
finally the first day of school came she skipped up to him and he <caps> called a way
to this day and more than likely for the rest of my life i will believe that laughter is the best medicine
protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to
strong winds can affect the building or even the dirigible
and always in her home there was happiness and laughter even on really gloomy and dark days
the world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned
again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear
seeing naked bodies would be considered setting a bad example
obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement blocking snakes also plays a role in affecting the cyclists as he move on the <num> road only doing 12 mph
another obstacle the builders faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to a dirigible floating in the air
the violent winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast
people think differently from each other
is showing an <caps> of love
he tells how his parents had open arms and doors to people in the community who needed help
i would have to agree with the second group of people
after that website you could go out and get the you will need
youtube is a social network of laughter
in our country we are allowed to express our opinion by the <caps>
i believe that every people contain their own personality in their laughter
i am writing about a time when someone i knew was extremely patient
then we said our goodbyes and i went to the bus stop
the mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude and great memories
<person> just got a new computer for his birthday last week
patience also has to work with listening or respect
<caps> teaches me how to type
therefore the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how she will adapt as well as the hibiscus
although it would have opened new doors for means of travel there were too many safety violation for it to be worth while
the mood of this passage is very warm and personal
i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas
the features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist
our two time periods are a lot different
my second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family
in computers are wonderful things
also you can socialize as well as study with this device
lets use my religious beliefs for an example
i walked in and well there i found out what a <caps> was
once there was a lonely puppy
with computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves
another big obstacle was nature itself
there are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away
in the second paragraph he talks about his home life
if he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water
hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off
the irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly
first <caps> going to tell you some positives about computers
one of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a oneroom furnished apartment
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
say if there is a book discriminating a race than i agree that it should be taken off the shelves
the empire state building was so high the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building
<caps> runs up to ball and kicks
i believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways
they should only have books they want to have
not everyone believes in the same ideas
there is a lot of music in todays age that can be considered very offensive
these are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting
just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library
i think laughing is really important in life
their arms hurt and so did their fingers
usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it
when we got to <location> we drove to the upper peninsula
he is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it
one way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about <person> parents
censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me
there can be different censorship on individual people too
but you have to be patient to do fun things i have learned just recently
we were coming home from <location>
winds would have been to great for dirigibles to safely dock at the empire state
he was lonely and my family wanted to be there for him
some of these things cause conflict
another mood is the family and friends
another thing is children taken books off shelves
you can communicate with anyone you know
i think that learning how to type is an excellent thing
my family and i decided that for our <date> break we would drive to the great land of <location>
i quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear
the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways
<person> hesitated to just ride right over it
she expresses that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
i also think that all books have a purpose to them
the dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated
the plane took off fast and we were flying
so i stayed home alone
this understanding that was taught to him had a large impact on his life at that time
laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want
so i started cleaning
censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today
it took patience <date> wait for football
think computers have a effect on people
but to some more than others
this mood in this memoir is a very positive and happy mood because the passage is about good memories and bonds between friends and family
that is my story about being patient
because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended
so i got ready at <num> am
one reason was safety
your absolutely wrong
during the beginning look on her situations in life
i have a half sister who i only get see like once a year or once two years
computers are very helpful to us and improves everything about the way we live
<person> noticed and immediately started to chuckle
it is near the parlor and down the road of <organization>
if it is a child or a young teen then i believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch
if <caps> based on a true story and <caps> offensive it should be heard anywise because <caps> part of history
the last problem they <organization> was the wind
or how old it can get
these are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out
first they had to design the mask which sounds like a long and complicated process
it was at <num> then <num> then <num> and stopped
the last obstacle faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas
and then a little after the our food was done
i was just too alien
everyone has different views on what offense them so theres not much you can do except just ignore it
these are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the empire state building and its mast
so this is my thought about this arguments
all these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people
for this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library
this program is designed to help students improve their reading levels
so everyone agree with me because you knew i am right
they play it so much and it can mess up the <caps> and they can not focus in school
and again he said no
computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click
i had <caps> interest in being pulled into this argument
the fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him
whenever <caps> brother and i got on the computer well stay in the all day
we cant take that from our generation it just would not be right
he tells how even though his community was made up of many races they still lived in friendship and unity
another example is when i go on a computer and i search computers
later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family
which leading to death or jail
also you can entertain you over long trips
he saw his friend and joined them on their bike ride
they even contact them by chatting threw websites
technology is a beautiful thing indeed
if they were going to have dirigibles land atop the building they would have to add floors to the building
he make the story very personal with all the family members he explains
i was patient to get off
without the computer people would not be where they are in life right now
so again i say no to computers
figure it out all yesterday
eventually <person> dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for
we had just entered the town next to <location>
the author states the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
all of ones friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher
he was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water
i went back again five more times i failed my permit test five times
the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring
i throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands
but the little things matter too
<caps> were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes
this is a positive aspect of the computer because currently the has been enduring the economy since the depression in the
no matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff there is always a way for them to see it
i know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not
<month> i remind you that computers benefit many jobs in <location> and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know
it all started with a book <date> <date> ago
<person> gave us a craving to learn
there are also certain people who need book for research and need to take home books for their projects
we were one big throbbing pile of laughter
they have a big forth of <date> walk and i was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom
this is why i am thankful
you can tell when someone being patient is when there being polite and waiting their turn without complaining about it
a thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building
so it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area
we finally gave up and decided to head back to <organization>
these game can past time and the player some fun
my brother decided that he want too take me on <caps> <caps>
people use computers everyday
the features of the setting greatly effected the cyclist
it is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it
my main focus that drove me through each class period was boys
these people need to get a change
in conclusion i am very patient for my mother no matter what
i have never seen her without enthusiasm
that is not what <location> needs
there is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive
he started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation
there is a difference between right and wrong
young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful
my brother and i collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts
they took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the <organization> in new jersey
materials should be organized that <caps> can easily see if they would be offensive or not
the reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping
the mood created by the author in the memoir was love
for about <num> minutes i sat there moving around
she even went up town to get me my medication
along his ride he meets some old but confident men
there were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed
this was not the time
and i got my hot dog
so i fell asleep at <num>
women and children can find all of these materials offensive
the lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there
they use ratings and age control for their viewers
they are used by just about everybody
and will forever be an on growing matter in problems around the <caps>
the winds on top of the building were consulate shifting due to violent air currents
new music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library
i was way too nervous to speak to him
so it all started that morning we had woke ate breakfast and took our shower and put on our clothes did our hair
he stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long
that is what i think affected the cyclist
the builders of the empire state building were challenged with significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the character decides when nature is symbolically reborn and renewed she will start again just like nature
censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents
how his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him
there were obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
with a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets
so next time your on the computer think about that
libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could think of
many people do this in their spare time to try and set up a reunion with people that you know in middle school through college
the author of this memoir put a mood to it
censorship has never ended in something good only the promotion of something bad
every kid likes to play on the computer
make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about
but when i have to be i am
my friend <caps> would come to my house to cheer me up
it is so easy that it will seem like you are standing right next to them on a matter of seconds
he is a <caps> <caps> which means he managed portfolios
the builders of the empire state building faced many challenges with dirigibles
another problem they faced was nature
even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry
calling someone from another country on the phone gets really expensive
sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but informative in many ways
<caps> this continues lots of kids will be fit and <caps>
i found it very easily because i knew where it should have been and what it looks like
when everyone got here we both were very happy
so next time anything else just think the other options
he wanted to get their because it was so hot
people need to stop over reacting to something that might have been said <date>
ten families wanted got in line
the author uses symbolism to convey a different message
another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas
this is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist
that one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action
but then we ask our selves why do people want to set at a library and read
she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now
then it take another <num> to get checked out
students love having access with information around the world
my dad dropped me off with all of me gear
it was just the fun journey of getting to your <date> period
this law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building
all i knew in had to be patience
the world needs to have laughter in it
you can go on game sites and play thousands of different games
not even curse words
i know not spending time exercising is bad but learning about new things cant be that bad
the <caps> says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the builders of the empire state building faced <num> major obstacles
taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution
the last obstacle builders had was that a thousandfoot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame
now lets get started with skill
another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water
i was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year <date>
then the obstacle of wind came and played
so that just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending
i think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess
this quote helps add to the homesick girl
in conclusion the author creates a mood in the memoir
this is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature
the moment we stepped out side everyone but me stopped
my concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives
it is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio
then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free
those are harder to act rid of that people
the determination to win and be the best even if it kills you
if a knife was you human nature world tell you to cover your head with your hands
the back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians
computers are also better and faster than a textbook if you want to know more about a person or a culture
i sat next to all my friends and the all thought i would get first place
because i was having trouble
two minutes went by and <caps> tapped on my shoulder
that was the best birthday ever
history has never been in the control of man
i also said happy because he is happy that his childhood was so memorable
there is no perfect society
its used to express several different emotions
another reason was safety
many dirigibles from outside the united states were filled with hydrogen rather than helium
i think in my head like <caps>
my parents always kept their arms and door open to many people we considered family
the setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills
he starts out confident enough and then reaches the first town the gentleman described
about ten minutes later we all were standing there and talking about how funny it was when i fell and how it made everyones day
my brother name is <caps> and he is sixteen
the <caps> creates a mood of happiness in the <caps>
the setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways
it is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf
if the dirigibles cant lead it could cause destruction and could be very dangerous to people
ill never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness
in sports you always have to be patient
censorship should be evident in all sections of the library
at first we tried to convince <organization> that <caps> dad was out side talking to <caps> uncle
when we walked in the doors to the library the librarian was sitting at her desk she asked us if we needed any help
the article states i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the library shelves would be completely empty
you never know what somebody enjoys doing
for one the <location> has the most obese children in the world
i got a little happier at the thought that <caps> theory might just be correct
i smiled at them gently
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
patience is a big part of hunting
my sister has a computer in her bedroom and i barely see her at all
the idea of dirigibles being able to dock at such an altitude to begin with was foolish
i feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not
the mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love
crowded <caps> can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing
so i went to the gift shop to get it out of my head
handeye coordination is used in many things
with a computer you could send messages and photos to interact with them
laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship
but think about a library and then imagine a computer
almost every office has computers for many different reasons
i think the fish will love this
they would most likely to tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material
this means some people prefer to write than type
some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor
if a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things
my mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to
the older generations lived a happy not violent life
the violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents
libraries have a variety of material from books to movies
this is the time when i was patient to my friend <person>
computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources
the builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the empire state building was acceptable for dirigible docking
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways
when you go to a library you think its going to be a place that is a good influence
the mood set was a happy mood
so we went down to the shop and got the skid steer out
reading is very popular
if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it
it can stand for more things such as drugs
music is passion to most people
one reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of <caps>
two days ago i did a video chat with my grandparents back in <location> it was great
my <caps> soon ushered us into the house
the people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive
in paragraph <num> it said i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
i tried to peek at <caps> paper
i had changed as person when life when life burned me one to many times
computers have been so helpful for many people with this same problem
even if you are to have a high endurance
also nature itself with the wind were violent air current
i am so thankful to have someone that i can share all this laughter with
i remember when i was about <num> years old an i never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings
there are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter
so we told <person> to not answer the phone
that is all i have to say for now
the heat and entire setting made the cyclists travel much harder
a main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else
computers allow this
<num> out <num> people agree that computer help handeye coordination
another obstacle that builders came across was nature itself
the speed at which dirigibles traveled and the area and heights wind speed became unquestionable
the steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it
so if you put all of that together
in a library there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to anyone
after that he had his window open and i opened my window and stuck my hand around and grabbed his arm and scared him
he was very out of shape and lazy
most people would be offended and complain
not only do computer help out educationally they are probably the must well known information centers
the next day we had to put up our night stands
with very little water
<caps> example is it helps students with homework
i was hunting for a monster ten point with my brand new <num> and <time> gun could kill a dear <num> yards
my brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises
she went to her eye doctor because her vision was become weaker
i think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child
i went out for a walk after an argument with my work mother
my younger sister <person> learned how to read on the computer
the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below
in a small section of the stands there was a group of people wearing colors not native to our school
spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight
some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends
someone <month> never give up and do what he wishes to do
the weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability
so i can see what too much computer time can do
there are many moods in this memoir
money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture
he decide he was going to such on a couple of pebbles
also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired
most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents
on the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid
many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive
in fact should add more
i never finished that book
this answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness
the library is an important place for the knowledge seeker
<caps> hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers
there was a sign that posted a max speed limit
the builders of the empire state building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries
i also went to <location> and check out all the wonderful cakes
he never used a computer
a college university took poll one time
there is no way to make sure that <caps> book in the library wont offend a single person
if they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice
an its like you never should have lost the trust with a friend
you said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you
these are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society
there are adults that would like to see no more of todays offensive material for their selves than they would want their children to see
computers are good and bad at the same time
computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther
one obstacle was modifying and strengthening the frame of the building
the three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and i was almost to it
to wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home
i had to just worry about my match ahead of <caps> and wrestle mistake free
when they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles
to remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts
being patient is the best thing ever
just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone
<percent> of people say they learn social on the computer
<caps> when <person> got out of her car we were just getting <caps> her car
when i took the pictures i went to get my id
some books send out really bad messages but then again thats only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children
also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature
the builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium
her being depressed is kinda like a train wrecking off its tracks
i was so proud of myself on how i did not say anything
that way you are happy and so is everyone else
a <caps> large snake crossed my path
like when she first saw the geese flying in a v
the main subject which is the focus of the stories my <caps> retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table
they said that they can interact with family members who live far away
he would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat
thankfully <person> grandma showed up just in time to save us and we only saw the <caps> <caps> once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after <caps> encounter
slowly fading into the distance
he had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out
she talked to me until i calmed down and my tears stopped
computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it
other students hated him for being distracted during class and he often asked useless questions to the teacher really loudly
those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face
it is a happy mood because the author only talks about the good things that happened to him and his family
last reason why i that we should use computer is because sometimes <month> have to go on the for example <caps> you <month> had important message the website and you message you
i strongly suggest you look over my terms
adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper
some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves
some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working
last but not least i was patient to go on the tower of terror
i would also have my own room devoted for music only
we were all so excited to go ride in that perfect of a <time>
i learned something that day that friends my move away but the jokes that were said will still remain
another theme is to overcome your obstacles
everyone has their own <caps> too
it is hard to learn theme but even harder to master theme
by this time everyone at <organization> knew our names by heart
so try to get some laughter in your life
i ran as fast as i could down to the pit
people were standing so close to each other you would know their body temperature
<caps> s too many people here were never getting in
i try to indulge the person i spent it with and the exact memory that happened
one day at our bus stop <person> said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came
one least example towards the of computers their are many websites that you can
a child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button
then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do
what if some one looks up or check out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone
it was talking jokes about black people
i was running around and when i finally sat down i said
laughter is so much more then people give <caps> credit for
censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries
some people even create movies on special programs
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles
lets go show you around to your classes alright i said
kids do not need to be learning these things at such a young age
the author of the <caps> of <person> and the <caps> of <organization>
they blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see
thin i you for taking so are time reading this
in paragraph <num> <caps> shows his gratitude for his parents love in the quote i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the whole side of the bowling alley i was on just busted up laughing
patient is a very hard thing to do in life
if i were you go patient it leads you to a good future
we all stared to laugh really hard
people were sad because the <organization> lost the game
in my opinion computers do not have a good effect
so you see computers are not that bad
every <date> we got out of <caps> an hour early
i think this because in the passage it says there were no cars
it should never have been made in the first place
people <month> bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it
so thats why i think the <caps> can help your body
<person> was heading home and saw <caps> truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated
the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast
then it would create a big conflict
you see <caps> much <caps> <percent> of our population spends at least <num> hours a ween on the computer
these setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride
computer screens are harmful to the eyes if you stare at one for too long
the building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air ships called dirigibles
being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i see only a few good points in censoring
the shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation
in conclusion those are <num> opinions and <num> reasons to support the effects about computers
they should not have to think that way <caps> going to a library
typing skills are a great example
computers negatively affect the way people live outside the virtual world
parents need to protest so any thing they find offensive should get off of the shelve
when they got to our number i was sleep
comments <location> avid <caps> user
the heat because it drains your energy quick
thats not all though
i told her no and we got in the line
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building
she laughs harder then ever
this is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic
i told him that because he kept asking me why they are taking so long
the nature also was conflict to the project
the bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily
the time you spend with anyone should always be full of fun and laughter
if there was the smallest spark the entire dirigible would go up in flames in a second
living without sense of humor made me very depressed
then with drinks in hand we will continue to have a great night of unknown comical amusements
take history for example
the cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left
her mouth followed doing the same thing
this moment in time changed my life perspective
for one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual
these are the obstacles faced by the builders of the empire state building
take <caps> of <caps> for example
she also appeared quite interested to me
because of a lack of <caps>
what if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it
we walked around all <time>
the people who are addicted to computer are missing out an doing something fun with some they lose or enjoy to be around
the heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke
be taken off the shelf
at the end of fifth grade we had a little graduation ceremony
today was <date> so that mean i had to <num> days
and that is schoolwork
computers are the next best thing since sliced bread
it only makes you upset
a new mother lost her kid last <date> while eating lunch at a park
one day at the fair i was patient
the cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real
throughout the memoir
or even teach them that those books are wrong
it could even help you
but i still love him
and i know other people are patient for me so i should be for them also
on the way to my house my friend hold to use the restroom
they sit there like lumps
there are <num> big reasons
would add stress to the buildings frame
they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars in modifications of the framework
they had made this change even though it meant leaving behind their families
but with new computers they strive to meet every goal
the time has come to take a stance
the summer heat is thriving how during this <date> and he is drinking lots of water
the author reveals gratefulness through what she tells her parents
the author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied
he walked over and pantsed me in the middle of the walk way
if noticed <caps> likes to do things herself
what if you need to type an essay what do you do then
the open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist
it also teaches oodles of information
i believe <caps> the easiest way to trigger the best emotions
the thousand foot dirigible on top the empire state building could add stress to the buildings frame
there was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet
because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not
it reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor
me and my family were so bored
maybe even invite them our to talk face to face
this is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas
my <caps> agrees with me her name is <caps> i call her <organization>
i will not forget the time when i was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem
computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made
sometimes people <month> have sloppy handwriting
most websites <percent> give the ability for anyone to do so
theres a website called <num>
i looked at my dad and nodded to give him the sign to shoot
that was the mood i felt created by the author in the memoir
<caps> times like these that make you realize how amazing <caps> is
computers give you an easy and fast way to communicate with others
well you are right but i am going to explain way your wrong
my mom said <caps> me just get a couple one things
by ten minutes she exploded and started throwing herself around and freaking out
her name was <person>
this shows that many children are on a computer too much
we can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health
its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not
but your cant get a new family
i was patiently waiting when i had to get something to eat
it was a fight cause l wanted to walk and they said no
i know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse
the cave was loaded with hermit crabs
if they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read
you can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends
these games can teach us many skills
all these things revolve around handeye coordination which is best learned by computers
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
we were still a long way from cedar point
thank you for your time
using a computer will help us in life by talking or making friends on line
<caps> plagued the construction of the docks
sometimes i wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second
that was the first time i had smiled in a long time
this material can create a very ambitious young child
violent air currents and horse winds made it difficult to fly a dirigible near the building
one day there was a man who was not patient at all
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting the dirigibles to dock there
libraries all over the world are all neat and organized
if one person found my favorite book offensive i would not want it taken off the shelves completely
i say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance
you can already see people leaving
that was pretty good
she worked and worked for hours for two days
the geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again
the offended groups should just ignore the book
at the end of the phone call <organization> finally said he would help and plan the trip out
her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring
i knew i had to say something more
he saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a <caps> mood
libraries always have some type of organization
the mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love
<caps> has gone wrong with the plane but <caps> should be fixed in about an hour
having the empire state building dock and hold dirigibles brought up so hefty problems for the builders
do they have a good effect or bad effect
they can always be a positive affect on people when they need something
then they would get in trouble
there were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist
i think that we should read about war and witch them because it is a good way to learn our mistake
we had decided on walking around and looking <caps> all the cool stores
the mood of this memoir explains how precious is a home and the memories contained in it
<caps> the would make him become thirsty
sometimes patience is good and bad
we can not talk to my family or friends
her handwriting is terrible so her teacher will not be able to score it
speeding the development of climate change
give people the choice
these difficulties were the result of the setting
he was happy to live in a family that is unity and have friendship with others
it effected the cyclist very much
whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together
when they got here i was at the airport waiting
the next day was <date>
we still had giggles while trotting down the trail
once the geese and the hibiscus are back she feel like shes at home
they let you communicate quicker
shes an easy one to babysit
that is <caps> is hot in the music world right now
i personally do believe that laughter is very important in any relationship
i think that computers have a positive affect on people
the staid that was holding the drum even moved
authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons
and me and my sibling playing catch with a football
thank you for your time
children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also
the rode was all messed up
those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist
the author could not accept her new country as home yet
as the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town
the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope
so yes computers have helped us in more ways than one
but you can highlight the important
i have asked myself this same question over and over
that way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not
the ceilings must have been twenty feet tall
it was very terrifying to say the least even more so when i was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence
this is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did
i fell but while i was falling some how i kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face
due to this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
features of the setting really affect a cyclist
censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece
websites like <caps> and <organization> are most commonly used
soon enough our drinks were ready and we headed out the door
once i was at an airport in <location>
the topics typed into search engines will help find any information help to you
that is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people
the second way that shows family is important is in paragraph <num> when the author writes i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
we i have came up with what i think about it
she failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test
<organization> was already dead then trained with king <caps> but the others were waiting for <organization>
the offensive things should <caps> be taken off the shelves
i know this because in paragraph <num> it said over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building frame work
so i said thanks and when are we going to get in there
you cannot get away from it
from what i see and understand i that computers have a positive effect on our lives
we all are given the right to our opinion on such pieces
adults need to see what there kids read this days
we all stopped talking and things were really awkward for a little while
the last obstacle was the fact that there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the <caps> will always be thankful to her parents for that reason
if not nobody would buy the products
when we finally got to the front the wait was all worth it
when you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties
<caps> line is tacking forever
on the computer one can go to a search sight and type in my place in the whole world
seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort
i was once happy until i made mistakes
all people of <location> have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free
i strongly believe that computers are a very helpful resource that make day to day life easier
leave the choice to the reader
another safety problem was the high wind speeds
<caps> technology goes up seizure rates have also gone up
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the day was going by fast
my cousins and their band were going to playing that <time>
the library staff should take action and make a separate room for <caps> <caps>
when this failed the cyclist was even less determined
we decided to eat lunch here instead of going to the park
you have friends with and know who they are and wont need to figure it out
it was a space ship game
the first time is at the dentists office when i have to wait to get my teeth cleaned
this gives me the feeling of thankfulness and to really admire what my parents have done for me
they are united together and he knows that he is always welcome in their arms
the last paragraph is saying she will retake the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring
from slave states to all free states
these are or the many problems computers cause
this last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change
there are few moods created
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
i came out of the suitcase i felt so dizzy after my brother dropped the suitcase on the cement floor
this is unacceptable on a person why we should be prohibited in computers
<caps> would be a whole lot different without this element of laughter
laughter helped make a bad situation like my friends mom dying into a slightly more comfortable situation
i got very mad for some reason and lost my patience
sure maybe some people are addicted to the computer but others use it only when they need to
if you have laughter in a friendship it can really impact the relationship in a very good way
that a time when i was patient
a large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called <caps>
some people think that using computers deprives people of going out and exercising
when people push you just had to stay calm and be patient
but at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family
its just a way of life
once the laughter had stopped and the ice was broken we began to talk about other interests
computers have greatly advanced society and technology
experimenting is self contained
it is strange but true
you need to do healthy things to help your body
she said that her mom said for every word one of us said we have a minute of homework when we come back to <location>
right when i was about bash my head on a brick wall my brother enters the room and says thats it
i hand her the money and head strait home
i think that both these opinions are correct
actually there are many positive effects that computers have on people
this game helped heal the community just a little more
i check over his work while him and my mom had a fight
computers is a good benefit for people
my third reason is kids might have an email
the toys ranged from small to large to huge
i started to watch t
lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life
all my family members were outside
dear editor i agree that people do spend to much time on their computers
there are actually quite a few different instances in which i remember laughing particularity hard
in libraries there are a lot of good things to do rather bad things people always feel welcome there
all have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on
lastly the other large effect on the building was the weather
there are some effects computers have on people that i agree with and disagree with
<caps> are growing fast they are meant in be active and playful and without any active sport like dancing nor basketball they are going to grow big
the word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze
when we saw that bright green lawn we ran to it like a four year old running to a ice cream truck
it should not be censored
so if a dirigible happened to get caught in this they would be dangling high above pedestrians
we where stuck and i looked at my brother and he kneaded as if to say down is the only way
they also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read
i find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair
after receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions
i think computers are very unique and important
finally they are a major waste of money
i was glad it was with my family
thanks for listening and reading
at first the cyclist stoned off pretty easy
the calls of the snow geese were almost familiar to her
we invited as many people as we could think of
not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome
when the eight grade did reports their information
i await the phone call telling me that i can go over to their house
so what do you think
every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting
these are only a few of the reasons i think computers are great
all was silent except for the wind outside
if there even was one book that someone found discriminating or offensive they could always just pass by it and choose one that suits what they want
this made the back of the ship swivel around
my favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago <caps> i meet my friend <caps>
<person> and i had always walked to my house after school
one of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world
in all of my years i have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library
those who complain are only making more work for themselves
first reason is that all books and contents that a public library offers to the community should be open to everyone
first the computer we could use at for every thing like go to other place you want to visit
many people have been very thankful for this system
it gives her greater confidence within herself
until this day we laugh at me telling that joke
this could make some satisfying results
i laughed at the things my mother told me
<caps> has been beneficial to everybody
the net was the obstacle
more than <percent> <date> that is kids
if the setting of the book was in <num> a
so i think computers are a huge benefit
a computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home
so if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots <money> money
we watched <caps> <caps> and ate popcorn
my personal opinion is that they should not be removed
it seemed we were having to much fun that day
we started walking down the driveway
we would watch <caps> and play games until it stopped
now from ages <num> years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information
and his family cooks together which he really appreciates and <caps>
you still have time to change your life and say no to the computers
i finished <num> books called the sisterhood of the traveling saints i finished the last two books
they can take massive amounts of energy to climb
it started when i saw this game i wanted at the store
people are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer
you just had their best work pulled from the shelfs because you think it is offensive
recently i was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains
another problem they faced is the laws
this section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there
bullying has been a major problem in the <location> for many years
the weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as i walked from one side of the house to the other
computers also allow people to work easily
over my trip i had to do a lot of waiting in airports
well i think not how would that make you feel
you just have to be patient
would add stress to the buildings frame
the builders of the empire state building faced many challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
they are teaching us something
there are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people
the loving atmosphere was created by how much the family really did love each other
we are on the brink of violence and total chaos
she realized the once strange things were now part of her everyday life
but instead most people say cant you patiently wait to see the <caps>
thats a time i use patients to wait for something
laughter will always be in our hearts
throughout the whole time i have known <person> he has never stopped smiling
if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter
the winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat
children will learn offensive things with or without books
some people need computers
violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast was neither practical nor safe
there should just be a limitation on who can view it
the mood that he creates is a happy and proud mood
it will benefit both sides of this argument
he walked over said <caps>
we reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all
censorship is a law and it is commonly broken
computers can help with a lot of things
imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society
i started to panic and laughter filled the air
the empire state building was very high so it got really windy
it drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this
computers can be used to interact with another
materials at libraries are not for everyone
maybe because of some important information they might need for an assignment from a teacher
any thing in moderation is okay
it can stop children from exercising enjoying the out doors and spending time with family
the mood created by the author in the memoir
i wondered who would win
finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself
the paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story
so please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned
books more often are correct
so why should your point of view affect another person
that never stopped me from smiling or laughing though
you will be always happy and feel very lucky that you have all of these things
he had also told me that the safety was on
well yes i do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationship we have with people
to sum it all up i think computers can benefit society a lot
his parents gave him these qualities which he adores but he is eternally grateful for his rich culinary skills that were passed on to him by his parents
one book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is the <caps> of <organization>
people get addicted to them everyday
in my opinion only influential music should be able to be rented out
they can tell you any thing they want because they know that thats a little fantasy world
in todays world all children listen to music
those are the moods set by the author
the basis of the authors life has been the <num> lessons that his parents have shown him with their lives
our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other
<caps> i tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back
i learned all lot of things there
people never want to lose relationships
when we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer
it also depends on a persons age and maturity level
we decided go eat some place as we walked around to see what we could find to eat we found pizza huts
then another <num> minutes till our bags came in
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
a final example is aim
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
computers could also be used for bad reasons
<caps> because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel
i told you when i was patient
a couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies
there is this book we read this year called <caps> <caps> are <caps> <caps>
one reason is because you can do a lot of things on the computer itself
movies tell what ages are okay to watch those movies
if you read more you will see why i support these details
the dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes
the firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government
a computer <month> help people build skills now and for their own future
although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring
another problem was that they could not weigh it down
she gave the camera to her mom <caps> jumped <caps> to the bed
now i can write you a whole entire book about the <caps>
com and type in <caps>
all i can think about is after <caps> and lunch
patient i was patient when i was in <caps> or <caps> appointment to wait in the waiting room
computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends
these games start off fun but they become habits
<caps> barely got out the words cause of laughter
if not then i guess that child is out of luck
another was the law of how close an aircraft could be to a building
you can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there
the flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother
we were in <location> waiting
if she corrected all those this would be a good sample
i was so happy cause when she moved i thought i would never talk to her again
i can relate too <caps> discovering books thats not educational for them
say growing up your favorite books were <caps> the <caps>
they should not be removed if found offensive to someone but not offensive to another
the newest member of the team can not make a shot
another thing is he sounds sad cause he is thinking about memories
i believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons
it was dangerous to attach piece to the part
<caps> were very wrong
in <caps> <num> it says the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened
this does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because that there are some people who dislike them
that gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world
being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds songs on the first day of <date>
these books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves
he just kept working with me
when she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test
now mama taught them how to be nice to everyone and they remembered that so they got back up and let them go
even walking home from school with a friend is a good way to be outside
the mood in the memoir is very happy
we barely made it through the end of the wordsearch
this quote shows it was starting to get hot
in that same time people are getting fatter and they need more exercise
that so called <caps> took me down so far that i needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness
their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent
laughter is definitely the most important part of my best friends and i relationship
laughing is something that can always break the ice
some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it
if we need communication we have phones
<caps> lead me down to her basement where <caps> had all the junk food set out ready for us to attack
you cant wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe
and they all went home
so picture <time> a guy with all come on
meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles
by that time it was getting kind of dark and her neighbors were being really loud
had hit the crack so i sprang my knee
the <caps> and benefits of <caps> is really an important thing in life
this densely populated area would be much more hazardous than a rural area in new jersey
in the end he did make it and all it was worth it
having patience is a good thing but not having it is not
an do our laundry like it was nothing
when i have patient is when i go out to eat
the author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing
those the meaning of patience <caps> was a time i was being patience
there are many websites that have games you can play
in doing so they turned an apartment into a place of love and caring that he will never forget and more importantly passed this love onto him
i think people should not use computers
i never said one word to anyone
they were to type <percent> quicker that they could before
this was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the buildings frame
it was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns
the area the author goes through has an effect
the games are horrible for the computer
eye protection is important
the first design flaw that the engineers <caps> was the stress the dirigible would add to the buildings frame
then people get pulled in
has to be patient with others
she began failing classes
we really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped
just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person
now <person> and i sometimes bring up that day when we start playing a sports game or were just talking on the phone
she also loves all of the people around her home and how they all came together in unison even though they were all different cultures
we can learn about different places in the world
computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates
authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully
computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web
after that one day <person> promised that he would never go with <person> and i again
the author loved his home and had great times in their
that is my opinion about censoring things from libraries
it is telling us of his childhood
there is always a problem and my problem is i like to try and figure out what my present is
what <caps> is trying to say that you can love someone and call them your family even if they are not blood related
computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm
in conclusions computers have people
so to do this she called her friend <caps> to see if she wanted to come over
people can do their work in the computer
things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible
hunting is something that many might think as just sitting around doing nothing
but there also can be things that you do want them to read
the buildings structure could not hold a <num> foot dirigible
those people could be on there for hours talking to people
we parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came over to help
this tower served as a mast for the building to come
the few months time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam
anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement
i keep in touch with her on <caps>
libraries are great for multiple reasons
especially for breaking the test tubes
they we got on a lot of ride
we hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place
and one time we got stuck so that slowed us down about a hour our
this is my first reason
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
to most extent this message was very true
i do not agree with this
through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it
everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you
if it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf
the stands were packed with familiar faces of our small town
laughter can start in one place like <person> and reach out all the way to <location>
we need a ladies costume <caps>
they are great ways to help learning
i was sitting at home on the couch when i get a phone call from <organization>
which gave me something to do
thats just how life is
one time i was going hunting
most dirigibles from outside the <location> used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is very <caps>
the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast
computers have a negative effect on people and i say we should find a way to cut down computer time
the doctor said i had only bruised it
<person> asked with a confused grin on her face
there are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on
of course a computer can be helpful
since you are sitting not doing anything else you start to eat a lot of snacks
must chose to go on <caps> or <organization> rather than opening their books
if a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i
this all stays next all on the computer
so he and my cousin went in we asked if we could bail my brother out
finding humor in every situation is another lesson that my <caps> taught me
i was so exited for him
i myself was one of those people but with a slight difference than some others
then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
which is good because you can use them at your own convince
when we arrived at <organization> we were both excited to get seated so we could catch up with each others lives and eat
i am almost patient in everything
laughter is something everyone needs
first of all i think that when the cyclist came across the ghost town he felt alone and discouraged
and it was voted to be a ranking of <num> stars
then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her
one time i was patient when we were going to <location> for one of my baseball tournaments
it does not bother me when they do this
some blimps did not even have the proper mooring equipment installed
they had to find away to make the load less bearing on the building
and i feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms
and when you had <caps> in you mysteriously find you other paper that you finished and lost and <caps> makes you so angry
i also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf
the winds from on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
<caps> is grateful for all the people that <caps> now considers his family
you should be patience at the fair
he thought about <caps> for a long time
there i was on a cold <date> <time>
certain people would find some things more offensive than other people
computers actually help you with sports in a way
the builders of the empire state building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock
i believe that day that laughter brought our team together
our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my <caps> would take us to his game later
when you are patient you are come and without complaining
there are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library
i believe the terrain very much affected him
anger is bred from the joy of others
my science teacher always wants assignments printed and how <caps> i do that with out a computer
the same applies for magazines and movies
we sat there for <num> minutes before the <caps> came in
the setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride
i was really embarrassed
anything you could think of is most likely found in a computer
with your address they can even look at your house on a website or possibly get your houses blueprints
as we arrived at our fishing spot i noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
when she came to school she was crying
i read an article the other day about computer usage in <location>
<person> and i headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit
then this day we still say that for the <caps> can work
the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined never to fulfill its purpose
one reason why censorships in libraries are a smart idea is younger children search for books there
when i take a test i am patient
even though he laughed it was as if nothing no feeling what so ever was behind that laugh a robotic laugh
she was so ready to get out of that store
the computer can <caps> you in many interesting ways
the driver showed us a lot of cool things and places
the day i stand for some free <caps> of lays chips
if for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter
these are my reasons and i hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today
<caps> was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red
reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life
i am very patient now because she has a lot of tournaments
in the <date> i met <organization>
i was cold so he offered me a blankets i got him last <caps>
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very thankful
that is the mood created by the author in this memoir
from my own experience i know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie
i was cold as ice and i dug into my pack to find something warm and i found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans
then my called and said are you coming or what
also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour
to show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions
laughter is not only being able to feel better but to let out what you need to let out
we must enjoy what we have in this life
a good book is healthy
not every family can work well with everyone else
one obstacle they faced was the safety issue
my life was pretty awesome right now
then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle
you can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family
<person> parents did everything out of pure love
you can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message
any of these things could happen to you so i advise you not to use a computer
you need to be extremely patient
but the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast
my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family
those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful
near the end of the dance i asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted
this place <month> have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down
i feel so proud that they wanted to leave to come have a better life
when his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug
computers could even be used for school work
he shook his head like he had no idea
that day schools by <organization> <organization> just opened so there was no lines to wait in
my cousin who is the lead singer of the band was calling out in the microphone if anyone would like to sing a <caps> to the crowd
when they need to be working on their <caps> they get distracted and start to go and <caps> their own thing
and that their home was a place you could feel safe and protected
the book was very well written and just had a few bad words
some are even unfit for young eyes
people can do what they think is the right thing to do
i think the only real people that can remove a book for the shelves is the managers or manager if they agree with the patron
this was the third time we have had to return these boxes
should be taken out of the library
or if you want to learn about a certain far away place why not visit the place instead
or overcoming obstacles
the <caps> is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts
this has become a problem
with all the <location> technology out there
he observed how the midwife gracefully glided to his mothers bedside to prop her head up with another pillow
do you think that your eyes are going to be fine i disagree
i really hope that my opinions means something to you
safety and wind were the two challenges that the builders could not over come
they should not be removed from the shelves of the library
<caps> have to do errands before <caps> go
to this day the record still stands and the person who holds the record is me
they were stuck a half mile away from the surface
just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone wont like it
my views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area
just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it
its time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today
the combination of these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the empire state building
the holocaust was an event that became known <caps> wide during <caps> <caps> <caps> which was a major historical event
if you do these things you can tell that you are patient
another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family
builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
they can open a whole new world to learn and be entertained but also a world of inappropriate items
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of <organization> roof
one reason that the masts fate was sealed was because of safety issues
more than half of <caps> or <organization> benefit just from working on the computers
oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start a <caps> line in the middle of the library
if we removed everything that was offensive today
<percent> of kids in my school own a computer
she told the worker to get back to work
<caps> could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations
the features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot
she came and met <person>
even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay
when i cant go outside because of the weather i get on my computer and play video games
the worst time for <caps> life was waiting for <person>
another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to get past was the element of nature
also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends
her boyfriend was very protective of <person>
music can be the same way
this idea also relates back to the lack of exercise and naivety of people
this would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and thats what she remembers about them
i tried looking out the window but that made me sleepy
that why i cant be patient and now you know why
this was a night more
the mast would add stress to the buildings frame
libraries <month> always need advice
only one thing was bad
over <money> worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework
if a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction
we pulled into the <organization> parking lot and i went in
all he did for almost a week was socialize and beat his personal best score on a game
you can still do all that on computers
that book that has been marked offensive could have been a way for another person to learn about that book and possibly gain something out of it
the first problem they faced was safety
i think that if people rate the things that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands
she snatched her keys and we hurried into the car
i think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them
censorship actively and violently violates that right
the love and meaning of family
the author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had
when the bell rings i hastily leave to go home
i read about the delicious food and rich culture
the builders of the <organization> thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers
about <percent> of our world enjoys nature
we do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them
the mood created by the author in the memoir is pride
they allow people to communicate their ideas and opinions
the other teams were really good
he pedals great distances trying to find towns nearby
but not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination
she started to crack up
people are getting no exercise due to computers
know matter what you are always be patient
if someone is making a project at a school
another problem they faced was that most dirigibles outside the u
plus <caps> learn how to type fast
thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books
once upon a time where teens were desensitized to the harsh reality of modern living there was a kid
censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading

the next day i made a deal with him
my grandparents moved to the <caps>
i always give it my all when i feel like that
plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids

there have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past

the mood of this story is that everyone can come together in happiness and joy
everyone enjoys laughter
let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color
in the story the cyclist was affected
almost every family has access to a computer
it made me feel so good seeing all the people laugh
majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true
the cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused
but love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run
in the late run they would have to face the law
we left a little early so we could have some vacation time

the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building
this is a hard question to ask
the computer was a great invention and it is benefited mankind as we speak and that it is that hard to set up

some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves
therefore thats why he concluded the story as such
com those are the three main ones i go on they are so fun
the mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles
these made dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast
i heard <caps> music and learned some <caps>
you actually have to get out and talk to people face to face
anyway even if we try to go on different sites we get redirected to a blocked website
getting rid of the material is not what should be done
we got the truck back a few weeks later
the builders of the empire state building faced certain obstacles in attempting to prohibit dirigibles to dock
the builders of the empire state building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast
with a computer you can easily look things up without wasting time or being stressed out by having to look for something
that is why i think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality
do what makes you happy and nothing else
censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy
i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state this quote proves the dehydration of the rider
we are always making each other and people around us laugh
they would need something more stable
and hydrogen is highly flammable
to me laughter shows the importance of life
i asked my dad <caps> i could use the computer
my mom then called me over as well to let me know my cousin was coming over
my dad said we would leave around seven thirty but it was an hour more that we planned
who would of thought
see libraries have many things to do
this set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist mind
the theme of the story is when life seems hard take a new approach
i saw one help my dad playing we went out to join them
i have once read a book with very mature content
we laughed so hard our faces went cherry red
but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted
every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like
overall poor planning created very many obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there
so i think computers are a great machine for people to have
i have had to be patient many times in my life
since no dirigible could land on the empire state building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced
<caps> gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun <date> to remember
social networks only just make this even worse
these are just some of the things you can do with computer
<caps> father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway

sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured
we should destroy the computers
have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living
i think that when it becomes a threat to the <location> they should remove material
it is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided
patience is a person who is understanding and tolerant
i think the mood the author set is loving
then you have to get a new computer and everything all
the first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature
when i turned around to see if he was coming i started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up
we wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort
even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around
therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock
it has changed the content on our television from <num> years ago to modern day
before i became friends with <caps> i never thought i could have someone i could really talk to about my home life
i need to take <caps> pills
they we came inside to relax and watch some television
the last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family
<caps> describes the mood using many details
the man walked back there and took like a half an hour
in my school there are several students with special needs
if the books or magazine would start being taken off the selves then we would have less ways to research or learn certain things

in a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on
the next morning <person> a woken early to see if her mother had the baby

theres alway ways to not to be addicted
the only way a child can be exposed to this <caps> if their parents are unattended and irresponsible
thats what i use to speak to my <caps> who live in <location>
laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship whether it is being built or being kept up
the law made it extremely hard for the builders
people have to adapt to different cultures if they move
they might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text
all of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide
they were too busy role playing me closing the door while <person> said not to
my mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated
the next obstacle was about safety
but you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you
one of the informative ways is that you learn new information every time you log on
so we called a animal expert and asked
i am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers
before camp started i did all i could to let my mom not let me go
computers are a wonderful household object to have that make life easier in many ways
my brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him

we then decided it was time for a movie

we ate diner then played a game
there are many reasons why and i will explain this to you
the effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society
thebuilders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there
i eventually fell asleep
thats what is hot in this present lifetime
the mood of the <caps> is happy
then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night i will never forget that night
i will never forget that house or its neighborhood or the many things i learned about how to love
why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where
we reached <location> in about four hours
the builders of the empire state building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the song <organization> by the <caps> <caps> was playing in the back ground
the favor that <person> had <caps> <person> for was if he could laugh for her
i live next to the <location>
the day we got our schedules we talked to each other and seen what our classes were
she is always interested in <caps> i am reading
only with friends would we laugh and have a good time
<organization> are great because you keep in touch with you family and friends
when people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not
i know that at an moment the back of a life time could walk out in shouting range
another way was when he hit a fork in the road
we need computers to do <caps> things and do tasks needed to live life
and i personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been
<caps> is such a gentle men i thought to myself
the mood of the story is comfort
the world is revolving around electronics
a dirigible moored at the top of the empire state building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the buildings frame
also the winds made the whole thing very dangerous
you could take any famous work and someone could be offended <caps> it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs
the <caps> would always have junk food when <caps> was on the computer
<caps> f was in sixth grade i needed glasses because i was addicted to computer for so long and my eyes got damaged
<person> is understanding because when someone asks her wait she listens and waits
me and my family were setting up decorations one day for my <num> <caps>
he begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he <month> not complete the journey
then we grabbed some more wood and dropped it on the fire
its peaceful because you can just picture the admiration in his voice when he talks about his family
i would see people come in and then go out
i just gave you some reasons why i would say that
above and beyond all that new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees
censorship is not needed in todays society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in whats best for themselves
through out the tough times <person> parents went through there was never a shortage of love or the feeling of family
i told him i could still fix them that there was a solution
this could be a huge problem in the future
censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food
when i went home i went to sleep the next morning i was at home watching <caps>
the library wants to target all aspects of people
you now understand it better than the other students
and not all hyper and annoying
people love entertainment
only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom
in which the kitchen is the heart of the home
then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees
we had to retrieve something very important from my car
our whole family walked back to the house and immediately turned on the air conditioning
its stuff they should never even find out about
but some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about
i will first start with the teacher
but laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better
his mood starts to change very quickly
to help improve this people need practice
talking at libraries is always fun because you can talk about the book your reading or just hangout
failing hurt her greatly
based on the excerpt there are three reasons why there were obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time
there are hundreds of websites that will let you watch it for free
we were huddling for warmth
hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear
determination also plays a big <caps>
it is one of those things that just make you feel good
i think that is the purpose of the paragraph
this is very useful for me
i think it looks very nice
sometime you wont have a good life without enjoying it
the constructors of the building realized that to make this plan possible they would have to redo the frame of the building
censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose
<caps> first reason that computers are positive is that it can help you with your education
now i was to be patient with how slow she was reading
he taught us to write with desire and worth
this eliminates all that is heard about online interactions and activity gone bad
you can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type
when we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close
<caps> that person tells you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two
in the story winter hibiscus
whatever the reasoning should be censorship is wrong
then the main level or area should be teen books
no parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons
he was pretty nice and very goofy
we had to collect <num> leaves to get <percent>
he is proud of his parents on coming from their country and speaking a different language and learning a new one is hard
when the front was masted to the building the back would move around
a time when i was patient was when i was at the dentists on the to get a cavity filled
they incorporate their culture into everything
most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past
when i was patient i got a good reward out of it
they are full of so much more information than books
i believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting
i was so embarrassed
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit the settings of the story affect the cyclist
there are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others points of views
reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them
i know his parents did this from when it states my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family <caps> <num>
they should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day
another form of laughter could be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend
a library is supposed to be a variety of books
there would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive
while we were there we would be visiting my dad as he was working in <caps>
i cant imagine a world without them
in the excerpt the mooring mast i have seen how the builders of the empire state building ran into obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
we passed each other many times without even acknowledging one another
my first reason is that they relieve stress
a cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them
the setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain
i have been a patient man in my life
the wind also was an issue
you could wake up in the morning with two new feet of snow
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation
the wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem
they can adjust to new things and new surroundings
that is why it is recommended to make sections in the library
strengthening the buildings structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars
computers can affect the way people are and how they interact
comedy helps daily life
the author sets a <caps> of unity as well
it allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally
only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends
<caps> you can do something <caps> the time passes by faster
everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read
the books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday
this is because when you get a computer having better handeye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quick
every library has different choices
gather your family and plan a trip
thirdly you should spend time with your family
the cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride
the reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows
computers allow people to easily
this book frankly makes me sick to the stomach
some <month> relate to the story completely while others laugh at certain parts that they too remember about their parents
i say this because not all the time will you me to do something to do
spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life
though out this story there is a certain <caps> of <caps>
i support it because people can talk to their family that they cant get to see
we were driving to <organization> then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait
we need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear
<person> sits there and smiles at me
<caps> example i have a project in <caps> and i have to learn and search about forensic doctor and i search everything on the computer
in the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident
one obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced was the violent air currents
libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community
this is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place
everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy
the mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better
i am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever i look at my baby pictures
those children will either listen to their <caps> or not
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to make it safe for dirigibles to dock there
most kids spend most of their time on the computer <caps> or on <caps> or <caps>
i think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once
but they had faith that they would prosper
so i <caps> out a smoke to ease my nerves
a time when i was patient was when i was waiting for my dad to come home
some might not be appropriate for young children to read
the mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home
some movies that i have watched are not very well either
i could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about
sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away
and then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone
computers is a positive affect for our country because it helps us find information for school and for location were to go
i was the picky aunt
children learn by hands on or watching other things
the mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful
they are concerned there is way too much computer time
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
was like an hour long
i then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit
those were some of the different obstacles they faced which caused the lack of success
so i hope you have been i know i would have and there is no doubt is my you will make the right choice
you have a project for school and you need the right information
that means that the day starts at <num>
in other peoples eyes you <month> find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences
most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem
most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting
all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
she was always right by my side through my parents divorce
there is a type of boundary that <month> restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books
like i said you can do anything
so we have a lot of planning to do in a month in a half
the doctor appointment
some peoples love to video chat like people in the army because they get the chance to see their love ones
they could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it
i get really bad headaches
i was the most amazing thing i have ever seen
communication is another huge part of our daily lives
throughout the process the builders were faced with many obstacles in there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
it makes them think of you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too
the libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them
the authors mood of the memoir is that <caps> is grateful because <caps> tells us how much <caps> appreciates of what his parents have done
also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on
he is also enjoying having his family always at their home
there is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer and as far as advances in technology this is only the beginning
the mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house
it was really hard for me to be patient because i really wanted to go to <location>
i went out there skipping and just being my normal weird self
patient people are the people that tolerate life
another reason is the computer can help you study a place too
with this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the empire state building so close to the ground
it makes it difficult for him to bike
although this information <month> be in a local library
right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that
all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
that situation could go both ways though
this way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter
the one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends
there was a priest present and everything
<caps> said her mother
they would have to spend more money and time to create a frame for the empire state building to support the dirigibles
i believe it has a big affect
<caps> hid in a bush
often people laugh when they <caps> embarrassed or offended
advanced coordination would mean that person would able to accomplish more things like fast typing
censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day
lastly there is music
the sound of <caps> laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech
for example in paragraph <num>
the computer helps many different people in many different ways
there are many other choices that are okay
when builders were building the empire state building they came across many obstacles
the dog had actually died
the adult stuff should be higher up
it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where i celebrated my first birthdays
many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer
and could have even died
computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly
i told her how much i missed her friendship and how much i missed her presents around me
especially on a hot summer day
the time i was patient was when i was wait on my mom to have her <caps>
the next day i got a note from home informing the librarian that i could read the book
of course there are benefits
and that is why i think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir
my mom had asked me directly if i had left all the hermit crabs on the beach
i used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her
for example my <caps> teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters
i am a large fan of books over the two <caps> <caps> that took place
so the next time you think of banning a book think of all the warm hearts you could be crushing
we ended up buying three <caps> parasols and the fourth parasol was free
we both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger
i know the other day i saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim
if computers did everything for us <caps> would be mindless slugs quick
the greatest obstacle was the law passed
we sprayed it on the fire and i think my face got a little sunburned after that
those headaches over time can become even worst
kids need to use the computer because its another way for them to communicate with each other
i think that computers have a positive effect on people
this whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things
it also teaches handeye coordination
this one problem ran also affect you so many other ways
it used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women
some individuals could argue with this belief by supporting the statement that it is not the governments position to decide what is considered offensive and what is not
this made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast
<person> and her mom left and went to go eat
the idea of weighting the back was immediately ruled out because of the danger imposed on the pedestrians on the street
the architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building
he said flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
you could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel
plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop
also hes running out of water and becoming dehydrated
it was when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party
lastly helping with handeye coordination
i am writing this letter to say that i agree with how computers benefit society
once again i looked at the t
first of all he ran out of water because of the heat
he wrote about his great home and family
i heard my father call
and as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day
pg means you should have your parents with for the younger kids
hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die
he could nearly hear her voice
there are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place
its a public library
you <month> learn that in on place its sunny all the time and in other places its not
<caps> had great aim but he still had to wait
in my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things
when it is hot and humid out i cant play as long
<percent> of <caps> complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house
libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area
laughter is said that it is the medicine for happiness
<caps> opened the hearts of the <caps> children so that they <month> hear the word of <caps>
we should not get rid of the obscenity at all
the computer makes this easier for us to do
and that was the day i was patient
the other problem the builders faced was safety
this quote is saying that he is dehydrated in is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain
finally after two hours the called me in
not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling
there is many benefits to owning a computer
another reason is learning
there was a fish named <caps>
then their problem is solved
the computer started off as an innocent invention
i was a little cantankerous
she will then take that test again because its a new start for her and a new beginning
the sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point
the setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist
you censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book
musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people
the thing they have to understand is that children need to grow up
in conclusion people who wish to view certain material should be able to do so as i had previously stated
and have different books in different places
first the printer can break
<caps> just having a hard time packing up i said
both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers
he continues the mood by talking about what a true family is
another reason why computers are a big help because you can stay in touch with friends and family
after a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in
i could not ride many of the rides there due to my size
so he drank from his water bottles frequently
family had nothing to do with a blood relative
there is only one reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library
they gather around and starts laughing
so that is when i learned <caps> pays off when your patient
in other words there is a definite connection between computers and global warming
but in many different ways
the computer is good for learning but you should also go out and got some fresh air
that is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph
this will make her more capable of passing the <caps> ed test
you would be mad at them and wonder why
the framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building
laughing can direct you straight to a persons soul
it allows them to mature and grow up
a time when i was patient was when i went to the doctors
<caps> stopped talking and just waited in line
my first thought was that they just got chicken <person> maybe wanted to freak out <person> <person> i
censorship is the same thing that <person> did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society
another obstacle concerned law
i had made it though my first day of school
since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people
soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight
if you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to
it represent that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness
kids could be enjoying other things besides computers
the second day i walk through the school doors determined to make some friends
people say its a faster connection to people <month> not could reach
but as usual that conversation turned into a debate about over powered classes
the libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies
i <caps> never been able to feel like i can express myself around her
computers are useful but we cannot over use it
after you read it or your in the middle of reading it and it offends you you should take it back to the library and get a new one
also from paragraph <num> the mooring mast was nature itself
<caps> went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell
if there was little kids that want to read kid books then they should have a section for them
in the mooring mast builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there
your true self is shown in your humor
the people do not need to look at something that they find offensive
i believe spending too much time on the computer is bad for everyone
for example football keeps your legs strong and built
the second problem that the architects faced was safety
but none of my friends or cousins were there
this probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all
this is the reason why the builders went through many obstacles
you should not teach you children off of things like that it will make them want to do things without thinking or considering what is really going on
a day went by and still nothing
because it take times for some people to see instead of reading or listening
they would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time
<caps> and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes
then have them published for you to just take them off the shelf
on <date> it was my birthday i was just turning <num>
a third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles
computers usually make things worse
this is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials
also they <month> end up getting in trouble in school or at home
too but learning about nature is more nature
when i was in what i believe to be the sixth grade i went to <organization>
my boyfriend <person> and i have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families
he tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children
i nodded half thinking there was a magical medication or spell
however none were as hot as that weekend in late <date>
in todays society kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and thats not a good thing
that way was replaced by that rolling hills
the song began as well as the dance
some other obstacles builders faced was the safety
it was going to be so nice not to have homework over the <date> or during the week
otherwise i would be very very bored
students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals
children go there and pick movies out
i felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends
think for a moment about what you like
she started blabbering and said
and he appreciates that more than anything
our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured
this quote explains what the plant meant to her
if people are so offended then they should just stay away from the books that the certain author writes
hanging out with your family can be thing you can do
it also includes the notsonice content that will be present in the movie
he is a very good author
if they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out
that <caps> that <caps> loves to follow his parents goals and <caps> loves them very much
music can make you think about what your life has been throw or miss the person that has died because they listen to that one song so much
the laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas
so what <caps> you choose pay over thirty dollars just for a long distance call or stay on the computer
i was sitting next to some of my friends so i just talked to them
people find it easiest to buy something with the click <money> a mouse
its special to me because those people are special to me
just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one
though you will <caps> you started laughing your brains out
i do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure
when my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours
thats like saying if someone did not like how the <caps> of <caps> was worded they could just take it down and throw it away
opinions such as these could kill a persons dreams
they picked me up and then got my bother
computers have made our generation very intelligent
the computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives
i say that there should be no library censoring
being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to
i started by playing my notes for him
<caps> having an endless source of information in your own home
the extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing
there were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park
that book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past
i became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body
the tone the author gave out was joy
computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population
every time we think about <caps> we all start laughing <person> making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag
computers can be negative but it all has to do with self control and how you use it
<caps> is so grateful that <caps> cant express his gratitude
the unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point
<caps> her name had come from
please take my idea into consideration
this is what gos on during dateline t
i wanted to leave at stand fiftyfive but i had to by something for my mom and dad
the censorship that i am discussing is specifically about censorship in libraries
by her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change
when it does you have to wait to bring up your gun
before he left for <organization> he told me patience is half the process and half the reward
we needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted
open your laptop for easy translation
i smiled and looked down at my note card and continued my speech
i was actually really excited to see my cousins and the rest of the family
watching comedians doing their acts can cheer people up and have them start laughing
and when the snow melts so when it becomes warmer and starts spring
also the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful because the author tells of how his community was a family
sometimes a lot of people can got inpatient about something and become mean
the article was about the negative effects computers have on the community
during lunch time i sat at my usual place in the hall
it took her two hours to come back
its my second favorite sound
it is tone of love because he explains that his parents taught him many great things
but i have a few and one of my friends <caps> friends with someone that i truly love
dear newspaper i think that computers were one <organization> the best things ever created
i was doing a waterdepleting <num>
i jumped out of the truck and ran to other side
if you are a responsible person then you are fine
they might not be able to save a persons life
in the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area
<caps> teacher fell silent for a moment and then she said come see me after class <caps> i waited until the end of the day and then went to see her
the first half of the game was great and we were on top
i noticed you were having trouble with math today said <caps> teacher
in paragraph <num> he describes his home growing up in great <caps> that makes it feel almost like you are there
historic material such as diaries and accounts of events should be held at federal libraries
for younger children they should not be able to check out a <caps> that is more adult
a third way he did this was by saying how great his parents were
about five minutes later my friend <person> comes and walks by me and starts talking to me
when someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people
over <money> worth of modifications were made to strengthen and accommodate for this new situation of dirigibles
you also need to computer for school almost all the time and on a rainy day its a great alternative then being lazy a watching <caps> while your eyes fall asleep
a final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions
she knows everything is going to be taken care of
they high tailed it on the log and rolled the quad right over
the lesson was about <num> minutes and he was patient the entire process
so that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in <caps> entire life
they need tho learn about everything thats out there in this world
<caps> stops for about <num> way too short seconds
<person> whole back side was covered in blue sludge
within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic
as said in paragraph <num>
being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends
one time when i was playing video games
i decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery
when everything turns back she will take that test and move on
magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world
i made sure my parents were not home when i watched it
his parents arms and doors were open at all times for anybody needed to get back on their feet
all songs are different so you can use them however you want
imagine if no one had patience everything would suck
one obstacle that was faced was the buildings foundation
it was a one wheeled bike
this is also a time in my life when i was patient
he brought his laptop with him so he was ask to video chat with his family
computers are a whole new track and it should stay that way
<person> is very thankful that he has these skills from his great culture
finally they are a very powerful research tool
say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you
the mood created by the author in the memoir is gratefulness
sometimes i wonder why people laugh
in the memoir the author creates the mood of happiness when he talks about his parents love and caring for others
my voice was kinda shaky and i thought i was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at <caps> <caps> said
the cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across
i know when i go i always find my style of music that appeals to me
kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way
so <caps> a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat the computer will write the project neatly
the very first time we met he was picking on his cousin <caps> in a park up in <location>
all four of us quickly jogged over to the drive way of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood to where <caps> was parked
so just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you
when i got in line i was ready to go on
sometimes my dad and i would be sitting on the porch and look at the scenery
even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast
the mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation
she says she will when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding
teacher said you have tell tomorrow
they are the ones in charge of the kids
books that people say are offensive are usually the interesting ones
it would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it
programs that you can download make life a whole lot simpler and saves you a lot of time
she will not give up but instead retake the test
everybody is different and what offends my neighbor <month> not offend me
as soon as we got the residency we were free and could go visit her family without having to come back illegally
there is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half
one problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there
everybody share or have they own and they use it or not they cant force their server to it if somebody wants to net on it
as i scanned the seats it became apparent to me that i needed to try to make new friends or live out my fourth grade career a loner
they add him they would call if he got in
another example is that overtime the strain build up and up to the where even with glasses you can hardly see
people can not just take the books out because it offends so many people
seeing her everyday during class made it harder for me to even be in there
the computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday
what would we do without them
i feel a lot of different emotions when i am laughing
there is <caps> and like i said before you can even chat on social networking sites
there are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject
i can remember my brother telling me that laughter is the best medicine around
it is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers
also some people have bad hand writing
your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy <caps> off line
the computer does this
in the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive
the force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building
most kids come home from school and go on aim
i think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves
she buys it and takes it home in a pot
books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything
many blimps used hydrogen instead of helium
not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them
it will most likely give you knowledges about the advertisement you are watching
every day when my <caps> and i eat lunch at school at our usual spot were always laughing
i am not a patient type of person
people will be amazed
it will create a more civil trip to the library
the architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe
it should be left up to a person to decided what the see or view
one of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area
formed the backdrop to life in our warm home
there are so many good websites that you can go on like <organization>
this shows that the author admires his parents for everything they have given up to get to where they are now
<caps> for your appointment
so then making it harder for him to go one
but my sister always helped me when she had time
the sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive
one obstacle was trying to moor a dirigible at the top without stressing the building too much
offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on
there are many obstacles the builders faced that made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building
the <caps> mood in this memoir is loving and thankful and calm
we moved three hours away from my hometown
humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology
the colors ricochet from cloud to cloud
her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter
technology is all around us
the same thing applies to laughter
he will need water in all to move and get through his journey
this would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast
the author created many different moods in this memoir
all that waiting was worth it
when authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us
<person> parents had made her invite <person> and <person> and <person> knew it
also the computer can play the favorite song on the computer
i was finally their i ordered my burger when i was done it was worth the wait
because she had waited she was as excited as ever
or it could be <caps> charms working on you
i mean theres <caps> where people can socialize with their families who live out of state
the plan to build a mooring mast on the empire state building to allow dirigibles to dock their was a failure
this is how the setting affected the cyclist
i think computers are an important part of a persons daily life
they all talk on <caps> or <caps>
that is not healthy for anyone
a few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching <caps>
this is what i think about some of those books on the selves and what i think should happen
com and search any topic at any time
the builders of the empire state building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
when we got there it was packed
a solution a new wonderful machine called
i use laughter to let my emotions be seen
this also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it
it has made our society different in many ways
<caps> she wash it go <caps> then they left
he just smiled and took my hand in his again
lastly computer make browsing all the latest news a
they still cant tell whats real and whats not
to make his life better
families who stay of the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades
there should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from
after hours of riding amazing rides
that is why we should have computers and use more
our founding fathers creating amendments for the people
overhead i knew the stars hung in the sky but they were paid no attention by me
<caps> first reason is handeye coordination
this will always happen and theirs nothing we can do about it
my mom was the happiest of us all to get out of <location> for a weekend
i said can you just tell me she said okay
the empire state building was designed to be the tallest building in the world
all the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child
because it shows the entire theme of the story
i have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended
this shows that it was a waist of time thinking ships could moor at the state building because there is a clear law against it
the setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up
his keys were some were in my room so i looked every were
she loved spending time with her mom
the builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles
a time that someone has been patient with me is when i was younger and my sister taught me now to braid
i saw the front page talking about computer
i screamed in terror
the drinking record in the house for one night of drinking was <num> shots and <num> beers
i also think the mood of caring was created
there are sites to find where to go camping and have that family vacation you have always wanted
the mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways
a reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family
as as hes riding he sees a juice factory and goes there
a third feature was his thirst
the shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice
just a simple laugh got us out of being in so much trouble
they were as long a 1 thousand ft
my ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend
but this is what i think is right
another reason i think they should stay on the shelves its their opinion if the book offends them
com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids
he finally got to the next town to live
another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be <caps>
well computers can do that
our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch
parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching <num> or rated <caps> movies
that will save a lot of your day and it will save a lot of you money
there are many things that can affect a cyclists journey
now as you can you see computers really can change your life
no child needs to be put under a bad influence
staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong
adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or any other role model use inappropriate behavior
she had to get her hair done and some clothes on
another problem was nature itself
the desert like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty
his parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life
the people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material
computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired
the library is where they get the books from
in libraries i feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books
so when the line started moving and we were half way their the signs said <num> minutes
parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous
the above reasons tell you why i believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer
another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things
the knowledge of people would be limited to only what the library or the government would want them to know and that is not right
one day <person> decided to go out and play
it was my dad smiling ear to ear
first the wind current was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time getting close enough
but the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for
<person> asked looking over to me
one problem was that the already constructed frame was not strong enough for a new mooring mast for blimps
i had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes
any person that finds a book offensive should just ignore it and not read the book
when people overuse the computer they can impact their education
eventually we started dating
he was the only one in my family that understood enjoyment and he helped me live my life that way
<caps> go out and make somebody laugh today
first off i will be telling you about how computers help people type
he wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me
some reasons why you should <caps> patience are things like
it took all we had but we finally got the boat out of the water and poured the water out of it and the water out of me
<caps> a local environmentalist
you have to just sit there for like <num> minutes before you even go in
i stopped i felt my back pocket and there it was
they were on the way they were in the drive way
this cause him to slow down a little bit
your not thinking when you send your kids their that theres going to be bad things
benefits of laughter laughter has always been a big part of my life
the time i had to be patient was when i had to wait in line to ride shoot the <caps> at <caps> point
the architects for the empire state building should have thought it through
which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend <caps>
hes riding a like in the middle of summer with little water and in the desert
<caps> are many different types of books and music out <caps> and censoring these would greatly limit the variety
had to be intimidating
or if you have a vocabulary exam you can find the definitions fast and easy on the computer
sometimes people cannot call each other because its too long distance
i had to wait <num> weeks unit i could get it
it usually was a hide and go seek tagging game
patience the thing going mainly tell you time and me going at and you about a time when i was patient and how i did stuff to make myself patient
you know hes running out of water when he says
the social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social
kids might get picked
spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life
after school i waited in the parking lot for close to <num> minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up
the author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister
when i first got to <caps> <caps> <caps> i was trying to be myself and make friends
<caps> not the only one who agrees that computers are a big help
i guess thats just how it is now a days
bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying
a large snake it really did look like a diamond back
other websites like this are <caps> and <caps> <percent> of people in <location> have an account on one of these websites
second there would be less gossip
that could get together for dinner and a lot more
i reached <caps> sweaty hand in the envelope
they either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful
she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched
they had feast with music
it is still making them learn some thing
when ever i visit her i just have to tolerant her and be patient
the last obstacle they had to over come was the gas they used inside the blimps
after a while he starts to get tired
so when he got over he was mad and took it from them
<person> and i literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red
you can get them at any ticket sales website
thats why i think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others
and then i went home
all she knows is what she learned in her country
everyone has the right to read any book they want to
now i look back on how nothing is worth taking me away from them
computers have a positive effect on people
if <person> did not do anything for his loved ones he would not care for them
he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic
it is possible that they even might not care
the setting brought him fear but he made it through
people who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example
an example are games
friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby
the toss was no good
<caps> of them are classics that past generations have read in school
you can ask <caps> question and get an instant reply
at this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near
well if you let me just sum it up for you
the area he was biking through had barely any people
the tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book
computers seem like a perfect resource
the computer is defeating that purpose
i do not think they should be removed at all
the hardest problem to overcome would have been nature
the land went from straight to hilly
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
another thing computers are used i for as learning
how was because he was dieing in need of water
use <organization> but you would need and it
i have done this before
all of a sudden her face lights up with the thought of her friend <person>
in some cases reading and knowing certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world
they allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks
we both laughed harder than we have ever laughed in our lives
my friend was not happy
if builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction
the authors upbringing makes the reader curious and warm because they want to know more and learning about cultures and celebrations gives the reader a warm feeling
by seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library
another reason he is proud is because his parents would help give so many people home to stay in
some people say computers cost too much
the reason the author of winter hibiscus ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end
the sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water
then i had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice
drinking and just having a good time
they should not just off of what one person believes
our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong
i know <caps> being alone and laughing is good
an example in where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends
instead she had an accident on the floor in <organization> <organization>
the plants she grew up with exist in the <location> as well
we had to be quiet so a deer could come
she knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do
<caps> two sentences give a deep and warm thought of family and friends along with comforting images of kitchens and sweet aromas of cooking
another affect are the hills
sometimes some people can be patience and some people cant be patient and which l am one of these people
because for some odd reason i think i am just really funny looking
people should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them
many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them
existing law against airships flying too low
<num> <caps> ago a kid named <caps> was having a problem
we need books for many things from learning to simply use up time
movies are a good source of entertainment and that wont change either
computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody
now that <caps> is in shape for any sport <caps> plays
her name was <person> and she was <caps> best friend
i think that they libraries should not remove any of the books they have now
we had the best time of our lives
that is only one of the reasons i think computers are beneficial to society
<caps> was sitting in the corner chair where i had set my stuff
another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights
i would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
violent air currents that flow above the building
the features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally
clearly communication is a must have
the last reason why we should have computer
sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again
the was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door
it is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person
some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education
as a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown
like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left
if this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything
finally <caps> decided it was time for the grand tour of the home
i just smiled and i knew this was going to be a really good relationship
i strolled into art class merely <num> seconds late on a particularly average day
so those are some obstacles that the constructors of the mast had to overcome to build the mast upon the empire state building in <location>
so i started reading my book
this was because it was very ironic were he was
instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials
you can talk to that person and find many race
my older brother was happy for some reason
staying off computer is a great way to help yourself and other people to
i put my head under the faucet trying to clear it out a little
the theme of this story is adjusting to things in life
the mood created by the author in the memoir was strong
well i have <num> good reasons as to why computers are good technology
he got mad when i told him that he only got two right
or get email with is like getting real mail but from an computer
he says in the memoir that he is eternally grateful and still has a love of cooking
<organization> and i hang out all the time
she had great neighbors
if the movie you watch is more towards the <caps> section then it will have more offensive language and violent scenes
she intends to retake the drivers test
thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going
it was finally my turn
my teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money i got
anything can be a home
he is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth
first was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof
there was also violent air currents and a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas
then i will take the test again
she has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in
they have the biggest voice of everybody put together
everyone was so amazed at <caps> <caps> could do
some people get obese by doing this
the moment when you made laughing an important part of your pass
the third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come
after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit
in paragraph <num> the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out this breezy jaunt
we looked back at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing
thats all that <caps> mother had
i had great teachers and all the classes i wanted
another was the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
talking to people from around the world can be interesting
<caps> is absolutely terrifying
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building were too great and too many
the cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening
one when i was patient was when we were going of north
politicians themselves especially
find another way to solve that problem
censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people
and that is the mood of the memoir
by meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust
adults <month> have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library
but continued to move on
computers are not that bad
you can run a business from your very own living room
here is a short example
the curtains rose and the assembly began
but my favorite game is <caps> the hedgehog
in this memoir of the author creates a clear mood
using computers will help you do this and make your life easier
i know i should at least try it since this was my last year in middle school and i should just go for it
the front rows were the craziest rows
laughter is the shortest distance between two people
i really liked <person> and i wanted to see her again soon
the mood created by the author was grateful and happy
he says that is can expand our knowledge
so you should watch out because the computer is the only place <caps> you can lie
the man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting
lastly the mood conveyed to me was one of sadness
the idea of the mooring was shelved
they wont enjoy their life outside of their houses
over in the book section there are <person> and <person>
if you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse
just adding it on would upset the buildings structure and foundation
the ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much
over <percent> of kids in the <caps>
no one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some <month> think they are inappropriate
we always have each others back
it is also very windy around the empire state building
some materials found in libraries that <month> be offensive to one person <month> not be offensive to others
maybe try looking at a a few pages of a book you once heard about
things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach
they maybe similar to the computer but they are something you can do on the <caps>
it was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly
one difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast
rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house
eventually libraries will have nothing left
but she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope
you have to wait until they done
based on the excerpt the builders faced many hard tasks the builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there
computers cause people to be less active
this shows the readers that the way he words things sounds almost unreliable
the hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times
people do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on
thats all i have to say
the authors origin makes the reader curious because they want to know more about the author
i think the mood the author created in the memoir is love
that day l learned that i have a lot more patience than i thought i did
many children are growing up without mom or dad
after a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore
the layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out
there are things people will not agree with
there are many people on the computer and if must be stopped
then finally after hours of cleaning the bathroom is back to the way it should be
another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate
i waited an hour to get in
most modern day businesses are run by computers
she could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever i went
the computer allows you to do <caps> things without actually encountering their happenings
nature also played a role in this struggle over making this mast work
this turned into a day of jokes
when we got to the dance i walked on the right side of <date> to avoid confrontation
he would never see his mother on <location> again
i makes them blind to enjoy nature
some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient
bus got the i fell asleep
the heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey
that is why i think the author included that paragraph
make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely
by her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom
we had to sit in the waiting room
and i will show you why
they shook their head yes hooked up the car and a way we went
censorship could take away your favorite series of books of the public library because of group of people thought it was offensive
the obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building were severe
the snow will melt because the weather changes
they are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh
the mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy
we should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this
hydrogen is highly flammable
i see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them
the largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently
a curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read
magazines are like books in away
the cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to <organization> park
computers can be used just for fun too
my first few classes were fabulous and i was about to go to lunch
he had to travel a lot further then he had planned to
it also proves that she is going to be positive and not let disc overage her
the features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip
that is a happy loving mood
we only stayed till <num>
thats a time were my friend <person> was patient about her grades
<caps> i let the dog outside and picked up the baby and headed back to the table where my brother was playing
nothing with us has been the same since
there is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety types of books out
the ball goes sailing into the goal
i am not saying to stop using computers
this has happened to me before
patience is very important in life
in conclusion i believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay
then she bout me a lot of stuff
experts also say that <caps> is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier
visit with family and friends or even exercise
my third is when somebody new joins the team
i guess it all depends on your view of the situation
there were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall
once they lose hope they wont try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength
usually when you look in a magazine you usually see pictures so its not as big of effect as the others such as the music and movies
imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off
we was in this huge room it have <num> huge bathroom and bigs <caps>
a few hours after my <caps> died
soon we started running out of gas
thats simple kids should be able to only watch kid movies
we all know the benefits of laughter
grandma was laughing so hard she would fall back into her chair and i though she was going to die of over laughter
<caps> bulling happens to <num> out of every <num> kids
in the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water
too bad only <num> out of every <num> <caps> could relate to kid message
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be upgraded and strengthened
why would they put it in there just to take it all away
i do not believe books or any other form of art should be removed from the shelves of libraries
this needs to change
there are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist
we finish watching a couple episodes and <caps> my mom shows up
a computer offers no face to face interaction
being patient payed off and my arm healed faster without becoming but even more
even though people think it take time from exercising and interacting with people it not really time
you have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library
and at first they struggled but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future
our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks
and if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world
there are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people
i managed to scream between sobs
spending to much time on it
i hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people
his books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people
you know inside that its making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face
every laugh is unique in there own way cause every one is different
so we tried the hit the thing died center
it is points and views from an antislavery author
soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the <caps> touch to me
<caps> someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program
we had to dress up as elves and play with kids
the lunch room was always how you knew who was who
as we were singing happy birthday i would glare at him and look down
get with the program computers are in
man this is so hard to be patient
this shows that no matter how diverse people were
after having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors
we need to know also whats going on in our daily life
its healthy to laugh
this technology is the most best thing you could ever use
but <caps> thought it took forever to get her tickets cause she was not patient
computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society
she ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life
whether they are fiction or nonfiction
laughter between two people is one of the ways you know if you are really good friends
people spend way to long on the computer
they do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans
even before constructing the mooring mast on top of the building the roof had to be completed
the last thing you can do is become more healthy
another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laugh
you will realize that their are more than you would believe
in a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason
now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer
in conclusion i temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply
she had been patient waiting for an answer <caps> never came
these were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people
the builders a lot more obstacles dealing with the docking of dirigibles than just architectural
you <month> be saying thats a good thing
once upon a time there was a bid named jack
with computer you will be able to talk to your friends cant talk on the phone
i ordered we a kids meal and it was good
they are even now using computers to sell illegal drugs
exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit
the building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable
everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries
you could do by a click of a button
to me she sounds like a brand new person
a person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others
the mood of the story is happy
when i was around the age <num>
no one has the right to censor anyone else
i was <num> yrs old when i got a as
about four or five years ago i went too a friends house to stay the <time>
when he was there we both were patient to play the game or do what others wanted to do
there are no bad reason that could top any of these
<caps> observation when i look at kids in <caps> community playing is that they follow one another
they were very big so they needed enough room not to hit anything else
that was neither safe nor practical
i ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed
one obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area
freshman year and i was lost
people say that computers are teaching important skills
so i tried to go back to sleep
<percent> of the working humans is a larger amount
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
quickly i wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller i
a second problem with docking a dirigible at the empire state building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air
so we really lucked out on that one
the computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily
i think people should not spend so much time on the computer
concluding that some people die each year of being over weight
before some people left
we had all agreed with her at that very moment of time
computers help so many people with everyday questions
censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love
the adults use computers for there work ability and in schools
law being the last reason because there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas
she says sorry for your wait
people find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before
i think computers help people develop better social skills
i think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf
for example the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i thought he was right for a second
my <caps> and i were joking around and making fun of each other
it creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things
but when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my <caps> baby sister was so beautiful
also we can learn about faraway places like <location> or <location>
for about two and a half hours
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
we can also use computers
without a word <person> jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom
this affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again
<caps> had to make sure uncle <person> was ready to leave
i think patience is very important to the world
these obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building
she is all alone making her feel small and helpless
ill tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life
after that we decided to head to space mountain to get some fast passes
the authors description of how his home came to be and how its like warms up the atmosphere of the readers mind and make them smile unknowingly
he quietly waited day after day for the game
used hydrogen instead of helium
at that point softball was just around the corner and i began to reanalyze everything
then you would get in trouble for talking
the government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you
the happy mood is created by the author in this memoir
when we got off the plain to the second airport we went to go see what time our second flights comes in
my dad and mom both had good jobs but they never had money to do anything because my mom loved spending money and got them both into dept
one time me and <caps> dad had to wait an hour to two hours that way i could sign up for football
i once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology
he was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived
it symbolizes the time in her life when her failures will become good again
the winds on the tops of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
this is why i feel that winter hibiscus was concluded in this way
so should the libraries but every thing the people like read it
<organization> and i could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us
this article <person> has created a different mood for me
my boyfriends name is <person>
the cyclist was tired and exhausted
you need to be slow and patience
in conclusion these moods are the examples of the memoir
it has been said that laughter is the spark of the soul
the problem is that people cant handle what they see
he watched one of my brothers game and approached him after the game
all the heat built up a desire for him to get water
it is the same idea with a book or magazine
every person on this <location> will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings
this indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today
a recent debate has arisen over <person> the <caps> of <organization>
for example the text states
so my brother drew back his bow
<person> and i walked towards the car
also how one girl can bring me to church and how <caps> can keep a relationship moving strongly
see a message so computers interesting with friends and family
once you get onto a computer you never want to get off
so read my reasons and by the end i hope i made my point
they also designed a stainless steel tower with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building
we got home at <time>
another place in the cyclists trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory
when i woke up i just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp
then the girl went missing for about weeks
communication plays an important role for a civilization or society
the builders did not want to risk any lives or damage any buildings
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy
it is so the kids can expand there imagination as well
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
this both right and wrong
patience is a very hard thing to capture
the next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians
all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
it went up almost <percent> from <date> year and <percent> from the year before
another obstacle is that hydrogen in the dirigible was highly flammable
my second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them
the mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current
in a way books are both bad and good
i will be substituting the real names with others names though
now whenever i remember that i was start to giggle happily to myself
if children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad
although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie were everyone lives happily ever after
other people might see it the other way and they can
<caps> you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you
some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future
i was looking in the direction the sound was coming
these obstacles were the ones the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
when we started to move i got a little happier but still impatient
another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature
the laughs you guys enjoyed together
maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and every one swarms the stand attacking each other
just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind
it <month> be against some religions to read inappropriate materials
<caps> team and i rushed under a nearby awning
it was postponed and became obsolete with the invention of airplanes
then around <num> we got our first hit
i told her that i was fine
what if thats the only way they know how to express themselves
<person> was starting to get worried but he waited
some people even must pay for rehab
animals in the setting can also be effective
we were all having a blast
some libraries <month> not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others
he describes what he has learned from his parents and everything he is grateful for
the greatest obstacle that was faced was the use of the mooring mast with nature itself
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
because i know computers have helped me in school and more work much easier
the architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building
teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each
discussing the topic that was touched on before
the library would lose people because of books being censored
she is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus
computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives
then just get a door that says <num> and older and put cameras up
if they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning
i would go swimming with her family
when you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen
censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library
therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building
i remember the time i got my new puppy we had to be patient
thank you for reading
all of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it
well my life is filled with laughter and smiling
what i mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him
thank goodness for the backup system that no one had known about out in the <location>
other then that i think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past
my stand is that computers hurt peoples
the books could be a school assignment
<caps> said the whole family was coming over
then those figures add up then finally you struck out and its gone
i have written in response to the letter sent to me on the topic of electronics
instead you should use this time to be with your friends and family
another hardship that she and the hibiscus both <caps> is being root bound
another obstacle faced was the natural dangers of a dirigible
the censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too
at a young age i selected a book i had thought was a ghost story
never had i met a girl who could make me laugh so hard that i actually enjoyed hanging out with every day
one obstacle being to much stress on the buildings frame
these are the various moods in the memoir
the is how the author describes his mood
which shows that you can make the best of any situation with family and friends
the builders of the empire state building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
its different know they are still patient
this adds to the mood in the memoir by representing how great family is and how much it can mean to people
everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close
the single cable tether that would hold the dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame
a lot of times i get mad if i have to be too patient
the features of the setting in the essay do not exceed the posted speed limit affected the cyclist in a negative way
then as i walked onto the field they all grew a smile
she spoke in a cheerful tone and seemed to giggle after every sentence
my cousin is patient so when i tell her to wait and be patient she will wait as long as she want
than parents all you got to do is take those songs away
<caps> is another reason why computers do benefit society
in your own way about patience
when we all get into the classroom nobody what so ever did not want to take the <caps>
<person> got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime
<caps> time when i was patient was when i had to babysit my cousin for <num>
i think they are important and needed
i usually play for a couple hours
the mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked
but she was too far gone
laughter is a mystery
she is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful
there are so many alternatives then to just take those certain books off the shelves completely
handeye coordination is another skill the computer teaches you
or if the material can cause problems that should not have started
there were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist
again a moment that sticks to me was a time when i was young
clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination
as he say he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home
the only mistake is not taking the chance to laugh in the first place
another main obstacle that the builders faced was that the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
the mood in the memoir is mostly gratefulness and happiness
it also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be
the architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast
he almost collapsed because he is so thirsty
scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile
because in the memoir say that he felt graceful and happy about his culture
also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings
if not for advances in technology people could make me right decisions
its not right and its not fair
we cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the worlds past
it is like removing something just because one person does not like it
the author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time
my second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries
how could this happen to such amazing people
people are being too much selfcentered
where ever you look you can find a computer
see computers can get you into trouble
information is vital in our society and keeps us uptodate on modern life
for the reasons above those are some of the obstacles builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there
they had many obstacles at hand
grandma keep saying that it was itchy and tickling her
going <caps> that practice was a blast that night
in the essay it said no town but without a town theres no water and water <month> lead to dehydration
this affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament
i hold that knowledge to be true
it really did look like a diamond backblocked the majority of the pavement in front of me
<caps> to the <organization> everyone has the freedom of speech and the freedom of press
computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they cant be with that person for whatever reason
the couple would obtained a better connection to
that is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body
to boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves
do not ruin it for other people
<organization> had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular
the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting do to violent air current
another obstacle was nature itself
your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh
also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising
then i will take that test again
but it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read
while in the process of building the empire state building the workers overcome countless obstacles
i did the worst thing to our friendship and just let it stay like that
the boy learned to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first
the next day i might learn something in school that i want to search deeper into
yelling at the dog <caps> a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn
that is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf
and i think thats true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you
some people <month> think that computers take up too much time for the important things
eight out of ten <caps> surveyed by the national nature <caps> admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer
my older sister yet again punched me trying to get me to stop laughing
we were like gargoyles gawking at him
its said that laughter is the shortest distant between two people
but the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass
to so up so i had to be patient
many people would be made mad if this did happen
those were the obstacles that were faced by the workers during the time of attempting to dock dirigibles on the empire state building
secondly not a lot of people will go to the library to look up information for a paper for a school
well i guess that about sums that up for me
so the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the u
this is the last reason i support computers
there was giant screws coming out of his leg that attached to a bar on the outside of his leg
but i was staying patient as i could but it was vary hard
this would solve many problems such as children being able to check out certain materials
right then and there i knew something was going to happen
now that hes drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it
<caps> buddy we just ran out
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has new hope and determination
i could feel people starring at me as my friends got out of the car to give me a hug
you can use computers to research different things
she will view this magazine as inappropriate
even tough i have experienced many moments full of laughter one specific moment always comes to mind
it is a convenient and a wellpaying job
the author also said i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home
no one wanted to take the first bite
he describes how all immigrants left their country just to give their children better lives
so make sure they all stay clear and far away from them
the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast
this is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it
lastly the mood is interpreted from his family
this is timeconsuming and costly to fix
being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you
it is not illegal for a library to have a rated <caps> movie
when your watching an adult type most of them can type without looking at the keyboard
a day without laughing is a waste of a day
why should people change cause other people cant handle what the stuff has on it
they should just get rid of the book or magazine
<caps> had learned how to respect his parents
this could effect your emotional heath
one person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it
as soon as the cyclist hits this town he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great
libraries should never remove any material just because it <month> be found offensive
the weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water
my old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the devil in me
if there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material
a lot of teenagers and adults have <caps> because it gets
computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house
if a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly
anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it
and with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success
not only do computers help people with spelling and jobs but they also can teach us about far away places
then the rusty pump and ramshackle shed
the cyclist said that this sight was troubling
there are so many games for the computer its horrible says <person> of <organization>
but it all comes down to common sense
if more people had computers then they would the to questions
bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing
the first place we went to out of three place we were to be touring that day was the <organization>
i think it would bring us back a couple of ages
finally the roads were rough and you should go over the speed limit of 55 mph
another obstacle was the wind
my friend <person> was coming back to the football field after we scored a grant <num>
the next day we returned to <caps> was definitely an interesting one
he felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke
but on the other feel that the if he can make their decisions in what is right
when i saw the fish i thought it was a <caps>
once i was ready i called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at
the dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add a lot of stress on the buildings frame
this shows you how happy he was
music is almost the only thing you can calm you down so that you can focus again
he believes that he is not going to make it
dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights
cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist
<caps> who is <caps> from open <caps> and find out <caps> i slowly took of the letter and started reading they
finally they are <caps> for other refugees the celebrate there arrival to the country
and why waste time on the computer
<person> had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics
airships flying too low over urban areas
after <num> year that wish would finally come true
something as simple as driving a car doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in handeye coordination computers bring
i do not think certain things should be removed from the library
a time that i was patience was last <date> when i went to <caps> point
the parent should be the one to take responsibility
if interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked
<caps> went on for about an hour straight
he always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination
its practically the same as using a disguise
a dirigible having to dock on the empire state building is probably not easy
a few days later we went to the water park
you can get headaches from just staring at the screen for to long
in the summer time it is extremely hot
i think patience is about waiting
i talked to my friends as they waited too
his response was you just got off
the author creates many moods in the story
people use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings
no matter what we always laughed
caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing
for example when you leave the library the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library
the features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated
he engulfs the in a profusion of thanks
books are one of the most important things that we have in <caps> world
being social is an important quality in life
also most talkative skills will help kids today with there confidence
in most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together
another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things
i think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world
so i open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing
happy because the change the simple house to a home
with no reaction we resume position contemplating our meal choices
everyone has different views and ideas
it was illegal for it to tie up to the building
mom died by email them by phone
many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial
is what my mom said to us wen we got home
in other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it
the violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift
the main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library
<caps> mood the memoir sets is a warm mood
for it was strange enough to seem as a natural high day
dirigibles out of the united states contained helium meaning it was highly flammable
laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person
i learned a lot that <date>
the final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas
this comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week
my mom was very happy and so was i
then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving
a corner popped out of no where
i define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person
i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
many people say that computer is help them in their every day life
the entire nation had become reliant on computers
another reason why the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was against the law
gyms are way better than computers
the first reason i need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that cant be found anywhere else
this can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity
i was very upset because my classes cost <money> and <money> was not a lot of help
one time i was patient
that <percent> is <percent> more than we had before
movies that are considered bad probably just have a bad word or a scene where theres a little blood
obesity is one of the most brought up health problems in the world
it made me feel welcome to be there and like we could be friends
for example my dad works for <organization> and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world
laughter is a matter of life
by not being patient i just mean i cant wait
i think computers is a positive effect because it can help you connect with other people from different parts of the world
<caps> was still waiting for his pizzas after fifteen minutes
they where waiting for <num> minutes and <num> had gone <caps>
but computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them
smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished
that is why computers are needed
people spend to much time on the <caps>
the builders faced a problem with the architect of building
finally <caps> was at the smallest one
the author would probably want to relive those times as i want to relive times of my childhood
when we finally got to our feet our bellies hurt so bad and were very sore
they would get lost and not know how to read a map
computers help the society a great deal
family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations
libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it
i am writing a story about a time that i was patient
thus they would be able to understand each other
in life you have the offensive things
with this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else
i knew we were going to be here a while that point forward
he is the sales manager and i put the items together for him to sell
she had just gotten her <caps> touch and she wanted to put music on it
i know that laughter will never disappear
this means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills
i cant keep my eyes off the screen
therefore i play i spy to stay patient
the second problem is stealing music getting it for free
they needed special gear to do it
my little brother wanted to go fishing too
magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child
the wind could cause it to spin around the building causing injuries to people or the dirigible
there even working with computers to make better bullet prove vest so they will be more lives saved in war
some parents <month> not agree with some of the material
i love to go fishing because it relaxes me
one of the greatest obstacles was nature itself
<person> has shown that <percent> of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get freshair while doing their job
also his family was always happy
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable
my leg was pointing the opposite way that its supposed to go
please let them keep teaching
only to find her laughing uncontrollably at what just happened
<num> out of <num> poll takers agree that finding <caps> on the computer is quite easy
the first obstacle realized was the safety issues
<caps> told his mom about his good deed and his cousin <caps> got to stay longer
i will explain these reasons below but before i begin i would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear
there had to <caps> over <num> people there and i was in the <caps> of the line siting there waiting
i was among this group as a young <caps> who had known this group for three years
he tells out rages story about <caps> and snipers
computers can be addicting and cause us to play for hours
i had plenty of time
i was starting to get tired so i tripped and fell scraping off a good amount of skin in the process
well behaved children all around the <caps> is what you can look forward to if you censor books and magazines all around the <caps> in libraries
also people used books to study for the book is going to be read and then going to be tested on
one of the things i do first <caps> someone is trying to be funny is laugh
the author created many feelings in the memoir
if i were to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir i would say it is positive and thankful
i also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by
we were standing in line for hours
he tells of the hardship of the sacrifice they went through
lastly my third and final reason on why i agree is because student absolutely do not exercise
i am going to talk about the time i skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle <person>
we are still great friends
my brother and i were the only ones visiting from our family
you could also meet new people
to be part of something so special was an honor
a a time when i was patience is when our family goes to <caps> point
another big safety issue was nature itself
kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library
<caps> is often a week where people read all of the books that have been <caps> from school libraries
it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area says the author on paragraph <num>
the thing died and we still had like another <num> hours and we only got to watch one movie
these words and actions we try to censor are not going away
when they arrived at <organization> <organization> they were sad to find that their reservation had been double booked and the other couple had arrived only moments before them
having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me
it is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others
i told her wow your so patient i would never wait that long
we had to drive <num> hours in a small col bolt with five people
he could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street
the author had literally put himself into the memoir as i read
i instantly started to ask a million questions to see if she was okay
you can learn about interesting people in history
my opinion is my opinion but i will stand strong with what i have
through out the day or while watching the movie
the popular book to <caps> a <caps> was banned at one time in the <location> simply for using the nword
<num> hrs past they were getting madder
although you do need computers
just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college
she said i am running out of patients
if they offend you then do not read them
if you think that amazing then read this
children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them
there are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated
also if you somewhere faraway you can watch videos about that place
just as i had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into <location>
when trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from
these features affected the cyclist a great deal
a library is huge amount information put common places for people to seek out knowledge
in hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day
i got this feeling because his parents did hard jobs because they loved their kids
it was the same guitar i had sent <caps> i was even more angry
the author is a <caps>
the cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over
this is my last reason
another factor were the wind currents
cause when we left it was dark outside
you can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue
this quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the winds
that could be a good and a bad thing
and when i had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so i could get my game
nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding
that saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something
just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it
in conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting
the way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers
many women that <caps> starve themselves every day just to maintain the healthy weight which is <num> pounds and you can see every rib in her body
that means all of my patience will be <caps> nothing
but then she got cranky
computers give you access to talking with your friends
everyone seems to always get together and find something crazy and fun to do
hope you enjoyed his story
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
or say you see books you do not like on the shelve at <organization>
there were many obstacles that got in the way of landing dirigibles on the empire state building
some books are offensive but not all of them
if my mom said that to me i would stay around the child books
a welcoming and happy mood is created by the author
another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in paragraph <num> the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
therefore computers have positive effects
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there
they will they fall into a depression
thats what i believe a few of the good things are
you feel happy when they are talking about all the plants and when her mother accepts the plants when she bought
shes sure she will do better next time
i feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer
computers let you learn more information
i still <caps> <person> like crazy
and the rest of my night was only going to get worse
books and magazines are two fun things people love to read
it was a closeknit community of hardworking immigrants
to me being patient was hard but i did it
so its a <caps> that could affect <caps>
this laughter we have makes us feel better
so instead of complaining i stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade
so she moved and she would call me all the like two time a week
the former quote was found in paragraph <num> described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived
i loathed every time a person caught a fish but i was patient
are removed from shelves then <location> is not practicing <caps> it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom
it was also very hot
the features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist
the first time i baby sat was with <num> little girls
she helps homeless teens find places to stay and she is always welcoming
<person> dad was the first to catch something
you should talk to parents about getting their child an computer
so she says that she wants to retake the test
in the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting
the boat was very small
a straighta student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher
this would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents
that is how the mood of love was created by the author
another problem that was faced with the amount of wind at the top of the empire building
libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature
they need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that <caps> war <num> want happen again
then <person> and his mom arrived at the store
all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
another reason computers are bad is because of health issues
this is why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what could cause someone to become upset by it
the speed limit was <num>
we could look up who was the <caps> of <location> in the would get multiple sites on the <caps>
you can be sure that that is not something that i would want to be
one example of this is when the author states i learned there about how to love
i believe that the same should be done for books
<month> his message be carried on for centuries
this would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing
censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story
i always thought that was part of our constitutional right
the first problem they had was because of the high winds
you are exercising your fingers
until my sister reminded me of it and told me that story
but <caps> not sure if we just think were funny or if people think were funny
many features of the story effected the mood of the story
the author got this love from his parents
theres a lot from them that i learn from
growing up in a multiracial community made him accustomed to being a non segregated individual
it was towards the end of the game and they had a <num> on <num> against me
<caps> was only trying to help
in this generation everybody is rushing and computers
once that child becomes and adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library
the cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak
we had made new friends and met new people
you can reconnect with distant relatives and old friends
the author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings
that i now see was a bad thing
you should only be on the computer for <num> minutes a day then go get some exercise
it makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from
<organization> also tried to make as many friends as she could when doing the plays and spent as much time with her friends as she could
it told me the address the phone number and the name of the manager
magazines are stocked on shelves in stores and on the front will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself
there are a lot of disadvantages to computers
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
they also had the problem if the dirigible hit something or caught fire by its hydrogen gas
<caps> i think will help her do better on the test
a computer is a multiuse tool
the hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to just strange land
it was like the light were mad at us
they can be down right mean some times
we are always there for one a other
if a movie is rated <caps> it should not be in a public library
censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading
a section for the high schoolers and the adults and mostly everything will work out fine
i think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world
in the third sentence she put were instead of was
sometimes the best thing to <caps> is get some fresh air and interact with others
there once was a little girl named <person> <caps> was the important girl in the land of narrative
being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand
the entire time i kept entering the wrong pin so they locked <caps> account to be sure someone was trying to break into it
the wind currents were violently shifting
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop it
that is how the area the cyclist enters affects him
the outcome of that is success
<caps> we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it
whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing business meetings computer offer a large amount of aid
this is good because instead of calling people you can go on computer and talk to them for free
the right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom
those are the reasons why i think computers do not have a good effect on people
but when i thought about <caps> i would <caps> laughed too
so i slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way i could get comfortable
it is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose
people can be discovering many great wonders
i say that because the people who are mostly on the computers only know about things when it is on the computer
computers even help people in school for people like me who broke there arm and have to take some test on the computer
he wanted me to try it and see if i liked it
they finally calmed down long enough to say what id just said and i blushed but started laughing along
therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive
i got all this information from paragraphs <num>
in my opinion i think that computers help people out a lot such as looking up directions or even chatting with some old friends
doing this could result in less material for people of all ages
parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library
we can email back and forth every day
for example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it
and you would feel like a tourist
fun instead of being a no life at home
as i looked i realized it was him the big <num>
it shows kids that not everything is perfect
libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on its content
being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot
<caps> should not be changed <caps> is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio
laughter is what has kept <location> and i so close for the past few years
and when spring arrives and its still standing she can go take the test
people who <month> have posted the website could very well be crazy
did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer when the to learn a place or a person
when we got there we rode around the island on a bike
i tried my back flip
paper airplanes flying one direction and mouths going off in another
the answer i came to was no one
shes trying to make her daughter feel better
you have the choice not to read them or to read them
all you need is a computer
there are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience
that is when a comedian is on stage and does his or her act
so young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age
the features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically
computers are a learning tool
a time when i was patient was at <caps> the largest indoor water park i was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers
i listen to a lot of music when i drive to school and most of it is rap music
it is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading
i was the one who waited <num> minutes
anything about a family coming together is loving
but we can choose to read what ever you want to
can you see now why i believe that having computers around is good
even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be
the overall mood he created was gratefulness
i was at a loss of words when she gave <caps> <caps> response
this was one of the most popular places in the <location>
<caps> ever i get the chance i <caps> my best buddies instead of using the computer
i was only in elementary school and had already developed the habit of making myself sick so i could go home
they both being determined to <caps> in <caps> places
kids spend to much time on computers
the laughter <person> and i shared always attached others to us
there are a lot of stories that laughter is the important element
throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic
everyone goes on the computer for many different reasons with friends or for projects and <caps> like that
you learn so many good things from a libraries
during the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future
i poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face
we have had fights before but none like this
i believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past
lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen
and so local newspaper that is why i am writing you this letter today
but i guess everyone forgot about that
meeting and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom
another reason why it would not work was violent air currents
i think is dangerous for kids
these books maybe be offensive to some people but its there choice to read it
if someone were to decide to take down a book or movie that they view as offensive then they are breaking the freedom that this has
with a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the building
so far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change
<person> got to the door and tried the handle
technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor
its good because everybody is happy
i was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding
a little part of me wanted to go to sleep but i also wanted to stay up
the first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas
if people are in a bad mood there is this bad aura or vibe you can just feel it
i believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character
there was nothing written on <date>
the congregation of family and friends
however this can also be argued
the <organization> law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low
my mom had dropped me off at the mall i told my friends what happened
it would also keep people from loosing books
but some things are not suitable for young kids and young adults
offensive materials have no business being in libraries
the mood the author created in the memoir was appreciation
the <caps> <caps> in the story is happy this is because he got to move to the <location> and be born hear for a better life
because all of the memories were good ones
it seemed odd to me that i had only ever heard people laughing in those vowels and not i and u
then as we were walking to the car some guy whistled at us
no one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer
as we got closer i saw something in the bushes
it would allow people to learn about places all over the world
i often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than i could have ever done
on our way back we stopped to fix a pole <person> the slack in the rope that was pulling the canoe became slack
i hugged her and told her everything would be alright
this quote is comforting and adds to the homey mood
from being total strangers and now best friends
lastly you will be able to find everything you look for
it took us <num> hours to get there
many different people have different views of different kinds of books
they should be where the people that are <num> or older get them but i still thing that they should not be and there
recently my grandmother moved down to <location> and i can only talk to her on the phone
computers also tend to take a lot of time away from peoples lives
they had to come up with a safe way to attach it
i soon became depressed
that i forgot to order a game with it
computers also help teachers
i do believe laughter is the best medicine
the final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world
laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others
children wont learn at a young age how to think on there fact language
the place itself was a dump
they could say do not leave this section
this could effect peoples education and reading skills
you will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children
realized how much worse that accident could have been
or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer
my friend said that i could barrow his little fifty dirt bike and take it to put those tags on the trees
you <month> enjoy a certain genre or topic that someone else <month> find offensive
it happen to have the answer to his question
this reminds me of the time when are of my idols died
many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do
the author has good moods
once we got to my uncles house we met them then we all left
i urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society
we had to dress really nice
patience is waiting and being kind while your doing it
another obstacle was the dirigibles were moored in open field and they were weighted down in the back
the boys are making pizza if you wanted to know
just a normal family whose lives have been changed due to computers
after we had finished the activity everyone began to slowly mingle with people outside their normal group
i have had to use patience many times before
the mood created by the author in the memoir is loving
i remember when i was a little girl i went to the library
another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across
a time when my <caps> was patient is to day last week an yesterday
the flower also represents adapting to a new place
there are educational websites to learn about things
they seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity
this is because you have <caps> and it lets you know things that happen in school or out of school
but <caps> seemed like <caps> got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems
everybody should have their right to what ever it is that they read or like to watch
kids who spend hours <caps> or emailing their peers spend less time with their families
it helps you learn social skills that everyone needs
i do my mom is vary patient with us kids
like stop going outside and getting fresh air
all that matters is that you and are build a relationship together
and with this family came the good times
out <caps> still being past waiting for them to come tomorrow or today
people used to wait that just standing there
not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer
when i was twelve years old i started to listen to music that i enjoyed instead of the music my mother played
should not be removed if they are found offensive
some people say that people spend to much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature
this affects him because cant get water from the well
the main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive
not all adults would understand both sides but i can see where both sides are coming from
<person> asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner
people need to understand that it you are not patient then particular things want happen to you
computers are a great thing for everyone
a rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills
people were already becoming lazy because of television
i wanted to try on my clothes
<caps> now or never i choose now and so should you
and that is why i think computers have a good effect on people
so i had to wait patiently for her to come back
we met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for
<caps> voice was all shaky and rough
the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way
the reality is that computers and the worldwideweb is seem and used everywhere
it puts a huge tall on you life
so you can go on the computer and find a place that is closest to you that has the book
the censorship would still be at the library in a certain form
they were to be the boarding area for the passengers
would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
which was certainly not safe
he looked at the microscope and started drawing
with this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away
the speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke
also it is just flat out a waste <money> time when you could be outside playing a <caps> game
so my overall opinion would be no
many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories
it helps their reading skills but the content in the book is not suitable for them
the hibiscus seems out of place and is determined to survive when the snow melts
i <caps> wanted to leave the table but he was very patient with me
and if one does i will be ready
well you want an answer and i will give you one
even though they were pretty high of the ground it was still effective
in most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups
he is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong
some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable
the library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction
she continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time
the air currents were very violent that high up
one way is for school
my final reason why computers have good effect
people should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries
other people sit at their <caps> and get mad or angry at <caps>
the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast
sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it
it take over your life
to remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame
after everything was packed we were off to <location>
the importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant
there were a few cautions that the workers realized
over <money> in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be performed
engineers and builders of the empire state building were confronted with many problems and concerns sometimes only addressed by irrational solutions
there were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say aw
this is an example of how censorship works
they made more than the <organization> and the company <organization> makes the mostly used computer system
i walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair
even if from a simple joke to something that was unbelievable that hapend to make a grate event in time to share on in history of family members
we are all the same deep down inside
i began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech
the cop pulled him over and clocked him doing seventyfive
the author would not have chosen a better conclusion for this story
we can also learn about nature from our home
the weather could for bad and your sick
you see many residents just dying to go to foreign countries but have no money
and i <caps> believe laughter between two or <caps> people is an important part of any <caps> of <caps>
voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now
this is very bad for your health and body
all people have different views about things
my mom said you but i had to with a little bill
the mood created by the author in the memoir is proud
movies can reveal whatever they want
there are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever
the cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him
when they were done eating they went back to fishing
when we got back my parents were another back
another way is that of water from severe heat
think about someone you know very well
my mom danced me off at <num>
plus he talks about how much his parents sacrificed for him to be happy
over dessert he jumped into a standup comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to <location>
all we do is crack jokes about each other and crack up
some people <month> dislike them but they have good reasons why
computers only make doing your work easier and faster
the hot sun was making the cyclist sweat
we all thought <caps> was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary
she says that its important to interact with your family and friends so you keep a stable relationship
his parents let people stay with them until they got back on their feet
this can cause people in severe positions or even death
the situation is different for each person
mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to
that is what helped him survive
says <caps> <caps> <date> the missing child agency
but one day <organization> had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized how she was acting
my last reason i think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs
a guy travels to <organization> where he meets old timers and the give him a shortcut to the park
he seen me just laying there
and what they should know as a young person
well i hoped you readers
we need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal
a perfect example is my brother
patience it take a lot to have patience
laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society
now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know
i still heard everything they said and it seemed to never stop
one day i was in class and <caps> came into my class room and came up to me and she started talking to me and i started laughing
thinking somethings offensive is just an opinion and every person has a different look on things
the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it
as i went on i could feel myself start to trip over my words
if your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out
it tells us what was happening at that certain time
there <month> be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives
we went through metal detectors that caught nothing but my leather striped pink and brown belt
this is why computers are so helpful because they give <caps> a way to research other places around the globe
without computers <caps> would not know the important news when <caps> needed to or information needed for a specific moment
this means the roof and the top floors would need to be converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations
computers have a positive effect on people
we watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food
this is how the author looks at his memories
she felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life
these were just a few of the obstacles the builders had to face
they struggled both personally and financially
you never know who is going to look for what your have taken away
i was still waiting s trying to be as patient as possible
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot
in this situation i would ask for patients
the sharp spires of other buildings could pop the dirigibles
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
in the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers
and last they help at school or work
<caps> taught me that laughter can make all the difference in turning any situation around
we got a concert to attend
what i am to tell you is that computers help students with school work like projects
after a one hour drive to the school i got off the school bus and walked into the building
the cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town
she likes him as a friend but nothing more
this project is an example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute
posting pictures on the <caps> and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse
a major fear among the parents is the inappropriate language or scenes that <month> be described in books
then <num> hrs came we were starting to be able to see the roller coaster and people getting on and off
instead they could be going outside or even study
also the body of the dirigible can swing is another obstacle that the empire state building faced
many of the settings features affect the cyclist
everybody had now calmed down and walked away
finally we got to our hotel
one mood was <caps> and friendship
my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today
patience really pays off
a censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library
<person> began to wonder
also many more jobs want people with computer skills
a picture that took about <num> to draw felt like a half hour
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
my older sister adored <person> after a lively conversation about football ensued
i was so excited but i remembered that i would have to wait until everyone woke up
it began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly
computers help people learn about foreign places
we left the store and went to <caps>
there have been many memories made between <person> and i that we remember because of the laughter we shared
libraries contain thousands and thousands of books and other materials
i could not wait until the game came out
a only for a better life of their children
it seemed a millennium later that <date> <time> came
the <organization> ended up going <num> that year and by getting the second worst record in the national <organization> they got the second pick in the twenty tend <organization> draft
this last line represents many things
a library is a place for everyone
the children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out
there were many issues that made it impossible to use the mast of the empire state building as a dock for dirigibles
going on the computer can also be very addicting
we looked at the two previous games that we had met the other team before and laughed
the censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already
it made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first
these features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information <month> be out of date
for example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better
a love of cooking that is still with me today
such as <caps> or <caps>
that is patience story of being patient
she took <caps> and put <caps> on the kitchen table
computers are and best way to do a project
the computer age has given people in todays society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology
<caps> i tried to be patient
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there
<caps> young boy has never been introduced to such racism
that takes a lot of time and energy
keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn
authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about
<percent> of the people in the <location> say that a computer has many people think that from a computer
there was <caps> one around and <caps> one saw us
some might say that <caps> is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material
once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would take your mind off of thirst
the greatest one being violent winds so high up
laughter is the bond between my two best friends and i
this was because i was being patient at the party
handeye coordination is a and in life
the children were dressed up in animal costumes
and that goes with the same with the music
most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news
i asked why he was doing that and i thought their response was hilarious
in <caps> family on <caps> eve we go to <caps> grandparents house
people need to cut down on the electronics
the book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it
one time i was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street
laughter can help in many more ways then that
i can type a that big in about <num> minutes because it have been typing in other <num>
this is a disgrace to the school
we came up with <time> <caps> she was spending the <time> at my house
the architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame
we never all like the same thing
another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing
computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently
it was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and airconditioned
being a high school student and having a nice library in my school i have learned a lot from the books in my library
there were also safety problems
he portrayed his parents as caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone
less time on computers would also time outdoors
food gives everyone a fuzzy feeling inside
the idea seemed great
docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the buildings peak through proved practically impossible
we have to break up my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible
work sites such as <caps> companies use computers to control their machines
this is where i believe organization and limitations come in
for example at my house we only have one bathroom
but i was patient then we went to the game stop
we laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food
last one not story this lets the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well
<caps> <caps> is a form of <caps> where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings
when the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get
people believe that using the computer is a waste of time
and last children should be playing outside
she is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test
computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl
laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us
why is that good well my point of view is that business need that to order their stocks for store carriers and more
this left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast
the reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me
also many water rides
<person> came back to life
show or you can watch music videos
these are the features that affected the cyclist
it was still cold outside because it was in <date>
the cyclists features around him affected him negatively
it says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home
most importantly an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
you can bond over laughter it sometimes forces you to ask questions and get to know people in other ways you would not
running to the back stage door i dropped my music
when other might argue to it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of places in the world
<person> was always happy because he was always a part of a family
theres more negative than positives in having a computer
one obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the empire state building is the high flammability they have
i never really thought about it
the features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist
in my opinion i agree that it benefits society
there was really no safe way to do it
i cant stress enough that without them we just <month> be less in the rest
they just had one more event
the author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination
no one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect
we love to do silly things like sing in the locker room randomly or make the most dumbest jokes ever
laughter is the shortest distance between two people
as i stated in paragraph two that i used to be a <caps> user
the setting of this place effects the cyclist very much
computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
they have a right to write <caps> and we have a right to read <caps> and no one should take that right away
a time when i was patient was when i was waiting for my gymnastics meet to start
i have a broad view on this subject
it lets you make new friends and play games with them or chat
blimps fly about <num> miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it
if one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books
he will play on these websites for hours
there are around <num> billion people in the world and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media you do
the builders eventually decided on a rocket shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm
the second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked
the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
<person> and i were no exception to this
that is one way you need to be patience
saving trees help us stay alive
that is why laughter should be in everyones life as they are growing up
the little boy particularly waiting for <organization> mind to be made up hopped about like a bunny trying to make her laugh again
it was over <num> people their
i hope you understand my point on this issue
have a get together with your family and go places and chill
the library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back
these problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library
computers are vital to us because they help our reflexes
i also like to read magazines every once and awhile
that reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites
i was flipping out that meant they were coming
the next lunch i went with her feeling sweatyhand nervous the entire time
letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong
one of the very important obstacles they had to face was the thousandfoot dirigible adding stress to the buildings frame
people can think what they want to think about offensive material
in the <location> they are struggling as implied by the mothers reaction at the cost
it was a really fun day
movies are in the same boat as music
our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings
the <caps> says the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
its just one click away from every thing we need
so some people take it offensive
lastly children are missing out on the beauty of nature
not until after the mast was built did they realized that most dirigibles from outside the u
when i was young i was teased because of my smile
<person> is in trouble
i had to go to the bathroom
you can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on <caps>
there are more than six billion people in the world
this reminds me of my cousin <person>
exercising gives you energy and is good for you
my dad and i were all set
it keeps us in touch with the world
and once i went to my dads house he said <caps> is just around the corner
they need to be spending more time with family and friends
the time i was patient i had trouble with football
this accident worried <caps>
a library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted
this nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my <caps> year
you cant always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere including college and on into their adult life
those are some examples of some obstacles the builders of the empire state building had
i hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad
the amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is
because it was held by a single cable tether that would add stress to the buildings frame
i would rather have a few offensive books then none at all
now here comes the negative effect
concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home
he explains his parents doings
they were thinking screaming and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park
i think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer
this would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible
all of these details contribute to the overall mood of the memoir
he would just get me to laugh to cheer me up
if we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone
i was so happy that i could make other people laugh
<caps> thing about his setting that changed was the hills
that was the time i waited patiently
looking <caps> the camp site had been attacked by bears with trash laying all around and camp fire still going i started searching for my friends
that sentence indicates how much he loved his parents for doing that
well once while us four were doing that <caps> was pouring down rain <person> very very muddy outside
many people around the world use computers to communicate
when he talks about his friends being like his family it makes people grateful for their close friends that they have
should be censored and removed from a library if found offensive
but you cant protect your children from everything
<caps> mom hears the thump of me hitting the floor <caps> runs upstairs to find me laughing
many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music
he taught me how to use the riding lawn mower at a very young age
patience can be rewarding
so now you know that a computer can teach you things
well then they can use their computer to stay in touch
computers have even made our society
as you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things
they also have to make sure that the electrical system was working properly
this increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice
this well improve our
i chuckled this shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh
it was more depressing
but we both gained something by reading the book
she told us to go get napkins from the bathroom
shopping going with you friends and family
his parents left their home in order to make a better life for him and for that he is extremely proud and grateful
our whole world senses is
he was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot
then yes he did come right back
most information would have to from brooks
i strongly believe that being on the computer to long is a very bad idea
my use it when people are hurt and i know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy
they are big helpers
the mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author
my mom told her that it took forever for us to see you
the kids can look at this stuff and see violence
when a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer
right away <person> and <person> wanted to get settled so that they could join the others
at first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half it only seemed like two
eventually though time passed and the agony lessened <caps> grip on our lives
<caps> felt like <caps> had taken <num> minutes to just walk to the drinking fountain
computers can expand everyones horizons and let them know about places and things that they never knew existed
the mood of the memoir is love
then when we got closer i could not wait
he <caps> how his parents showed him love
they love to hurt each other
i will also explain how the past has an effect on present day
this is ten times easier that going on the <caps> and waiting for the news stone you want details on
one could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again
i thought i was going to pee my pants i was laughing so hard
magazines are in some ways just as useful as books
the features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways
<caps> you both like the same guy
on the <date> that we were there we all decided to wake up early and take one <date> hike to the top of the nearest mountain
there was this guy that i liked a lot that i finally had the courage to ask out after <num> years and <num> weeks
not exactly all books are offensive but some are
this right should never be taken away from us
in a time of pain all you want is a friend
i was still walking an the sound effects were so funny i laugh at it still
i said did you remember to get every thing
read on and i will explain why this is so important
i know that it would make me feel like i did something wrong
freedom to express ones opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others
if you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read
a third obstacle they were facing was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the empire state building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful
thousand of website to visit and even more games just waiting to be played
he has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day
she also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding
<caps> i pondered the thought we headed out to the rental vehicles and loaded everything up and started the day
the computer has also the way of communication
our power had just went out so we figured wait up to two minutes just like it always happened
it should be up to the children what they read
we <month> discard the worlds greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry
the mood of this memoir is love and he will never forget it
and yes <caps> is a story about patience
it just depends on <caps> the subject is about and how inappropriate it is
computers also teach handeye when using a mouse
but as of right now i do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries
i told myself that people come and go
that is why i think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph
if kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned
the when they came back quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself
these are the <num> main points from paragraphs <num> and <num>
the mood when the author says that is i think thankfulness
<caps> <caps> <caps> <caps> in the <date> just be patient
i was takenaback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about
we were siting there waiting for the food
<caps> was suppose to <caps> over to his house
they said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related
i have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it
they help you learn have fun and communicate with people faraway
the vice principal told me that i am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue
there was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy
i think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re
this goes to show that any project should be checked for safety precautions at all times
another example is a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame
its take it to even an different level with to male gender
be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library
almost in sync with my glances
all of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally
one reason why computers help us is by teaching handeye coordination
in all of these websites you can keep up with whats going on with your friends and whats new around the world
he finally gave in and jumped on the next one
you would just go on the computer and find all the information you need
when you take a real good look at computers you will see they are just <caps> good
all in all it was a bad idea
computers are learning more and more advanced everyday
i share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible
i handed my plate to <caps> because my plate was slipping from my grip
i enjoy feeling the cool water all around me
it would also be very dangerous
obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience
the engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability that dirigibles tend to have
so we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car
he then shows up at a ghost town
i walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway
it is actually kind of funny
it gives you handeye coordination give people info on faraway places
people depend on them a lot but same people disagree
people have a right to read what they choose to read
they always have a program that if you spell something wrong it corrects you
when he got to his house he told his dad that he did what he told
one example of this would be when i was seven years old and spending the night at my friend <person> house
a book is a book to be read
due to violent air currents the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting
it is something we possess with us throughout our lifetime
this style of communication has ever a new type of bullying
and thankfully my prayers were answered
he had eighteen miles to next town without much water
i understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material
everyone will turn out to be the same if they cant express themselves or their opinions
i was stuck sitting with <caps>
she bought it for <money> more then her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden
computers have a positive effect on people
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the buildings mooring mast was nature
phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets
it was a <date> <time> <person> we had just gotten off of the bus
one day me and my friend <person> were at <organization> and we were in the line for the <organization>
you doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth
the builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off
if it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section
the empire state building is one of the tallest buildings ever built
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
laughter <caps> <caps> <caps> laughter i believe can snatch me out of the awful crater which i hide away in
the heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water
hunting you cant go git a deer
this was a huge problem the architects and over <money> worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
then you also have the same right and so does everyone else
everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people
the time i was patient as when i was getting my dog
i am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good
after what see made like hours we were done and the next stop was the library
so i finally decided that there was to much i would not experience if i ended it this soon
people always get our names mixed up even though we look nothing alike
but whose to say what i think should have an affect
some music today is just extremely bad
my first reason is computer teach you hand eye coordination
we left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio
the water was cold and my brother said i should wear his waiters
under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination
books are the same way as movies and music
the dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street
it made everyone fall on the floor laughing
in school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking
children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output
thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on
now that helps out a bunch when your traveling the world
it caused many problems
quite a few times my mom has been very patient with me
my step dad was furious that she would even say such a thing
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
this just goes to show that prince really says off
he said that he would never forget his parent that turned this simple house into a home
if you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone
the navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the united states
i hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind
<person> came in and said yes her laugh is really something
that <month> have been the reason i had chosen what i had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense
being patient is not an easy thing to maintain
after the wait we got on the roller coaster
it says in the essay the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
while we were screaming yelling for each other
unless you want to put one of your love ones in the hospital do not use the computers
to me that is a heartwarming mood
this moment is the <caps> before my grandpa passed away
the mood created by the author
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
it was very hard to make the mooring mast fulfill its purpose because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
a computer is one important in ma life if <caps> behind in some classes i could do some research and study at home and learn about it
wasting the time they could be improving homework or walking the dog the time is not bring donated to a good source
and she got home and said we well go on stater day
i <caps> that if people want to use computer they can
they fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch
in conclusion the memoir <person> there was a theme of festivity and pride through out this whole piece of literature
that was really hard
on <date> which was the after we got their we went to <location> to see my grandpas sister <person>
mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools
a <caps> themed restaurant was an obvious choice and we decided to satisfy our hunger at this fine establishment
i have met a obese child
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation
i immediately called him but there was no chance of seeing him that same <time>
there are alot of great things you can do on the computers
the other major reason would be because of the wind
this is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him
there is no one around to give him a drink of water
because it can glue people the ability to learn about anything they want to learn
all the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders
that is what could happen if a blimp tried to tether to the building
you began to look sloppy and nobody wants you
writers <month> state things that to some degree <month> offend one in a million people
t know i had been a good girl by being patient
events such as that are the exact reason why i think that almost any book belongs on the shelf
i was patient for about four months
one time when i was patient was when a new video game was coming out
<caps> i thought her cloth need changing
one time that l was patient was when we went to <location> <caps>
while we were on the bus <person> decided that we shall go to <organization>
this is because in paragraph <num> it states that the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
<person> secretly left his house and went because he was curious
if we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature
in paragraph <num> it says my mother and father had come to this country with such courage
the greatest difference between our country and a totalitarian government is the simple freedom allowed in the <location>
there are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display
if books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adults choices on what they do in life
the walk way sounded silent
they needed a new part so the emergency slide would work
you will get used to talking to people and when you get comfortable you will talk to them in real life
information of any kind is a good <caps> no matter the content of it
computers have a positive effect on people
and in the end it turned out i had a broken arm
she was flying to <location> to her dads house
each golden curl ends at her belly button
dr <person> of <organization> researched how parents hardly spend time with their family
the author also mentioned that he would always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice and how important family and friends are
i even became friends with them
that is how you get kicked off of these things
offensive material will <caps> be out in the world
in the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him
like singing or dancing
immediately i <caps> my parents to let me go with the only exception of turning in my job application to <organization> before i left for camping
laughter can be used through every day life
it is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family
these reasons give credibility to the idea that the empire state building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay
another horrifying conclusion that the computer does to us is rip apart us from our loved ones
every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate
my first reason i think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places
it was a lot of fun but it was getting dark fast so we moved faster until it was completely finished
where he is riding there is up and down hills also the road is very rough
this would be of good importance to me if you took my letter into
she practically jumped on me we we hugging for like five <caps>
one person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive
but she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers
should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is
we were waiting on the bus to come but i was very angry because it seemed like it took forever to come
they could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws
if one wishes to learn about how to murder in a <caps> then i think they should be aloud to do so
the author looks back on all the good times <caps> had as a kid
in <num> it says that there was an existing law against flying airship above urban areas
if they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights
but they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their rights
when she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding
when she says that her babysitter was her first friend
she takes one look at the halfnaked girls fighting each other and turns off the <caps> and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me
one person <month> think a book is offensive but the next <month> not
it created a happy environment to live in compared to the many other towns with horrible racism and segregation
she was observing herself and how different she appeared as well
not only are there websites
the mood is also grateful
he said that all the different cultures came together in solidarity and friendship and everyone was hardworking
censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world
books are not the only things that might offend some people
is happy in that memoir because <caps> only revisits memories that <caps> was fond of
a third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
the setting affected the cyclist a lot
offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior
arguments about every little thing will always be at hand
they have tons of games for kids and for adults too
computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites
the last problem builders faced was the law
censorship in the world is getting worse everyday
lastly the computer can save lives
in the last paragraph the author explains that home is were he learned the real definition of family and love
one main problem was the buildings strength
the cyclist still has high spirits
but if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below
one time i was patient was when me and three other of my friends were hanging out at school one day
every book has a meaning or message that all should know about
i am simply an impatient person
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelfthat work i abhorthen so does everyone else
the committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also
that day l walked that was good to be patient
whenever i would meet him he would do something special for me and made me laugh
i think you should consider less computer time
they try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be
all three of us went to town and went to <organization> for <caps>
<person> is grateful for his parents arriving in <location>
there was a time when i had to be patient
then they all get very depressed
people were slipping and falling constantly
however it has a lot of problems the building
patient is very hard when your waiting for something you want
it was the night before she had her
she just had a conversation with my grandparents while i watched television
<caps> she rush out the <caps> left us there while go get us something to eat <caps> we clean up while
when i look back <caps> realize how important that <date> was i can see that it was a perfect <caps> for everyone
this can lead you to getting glasses or possibly going blind
they have allowed us and how to improve our lives
i figured they were just <caps> friends coming to help me
all materials in a library are for the public
well <caps> did not know how to swim so i had to teach him myself as a good owner and all
there flight has arrived and only there was three people there
the obstacles the builders faced were that they realized hydrogen was very flammable
finally there is no water around
also mored dirigibles would be constantly swing around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the empire state building
<caps> was a very fun weekend and even though i got hurt we still made the best of <caps>
there is no possible way of getting around it
i walked into the big open room
thats how the family written about acts in this memoir
did you know that you can literally but from on your computer
you should always <caps> patient or things <month> turn out bad
the sun was up but it was still a little cold
people still rely on computers just as much more today
starting a story out with two <num> <date> old boys named <organization> can already be considered a comedy
one can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book
i <person> was the last one in line
and that was my story of patiences
the setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake
adding a mooring mast seemed full proof at the time but this new construction plan endured on many obstacles
one day i was at my <caps> <caps> house to celebrate my cousins <caps>
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
which leads to two other reasons
in conclusion i really felt like i had patience and since that day forward i have sat down and let people tell me about their problems
because of researching this offensive material you can learn more about <caps>
everyone was and most likely is till patient
at the end of that class period they all got some candy
these are some really good effects that computers have on people
i think the authors mood was kind of like <caps>
they have all types of game systems out there just for computers
the parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away
there mostly for older teens and grown ups
something <month> seem offensive to one person but someone else <month> find that interesting
most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan
should there be computers in are society
she also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock
the story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited
computers teach hand eye coordinator by training your hand to go where your brain tells it to and where your eyes show it
i say if someone spends there time and effort then it should be allowed for those who do enjoy it
i guess its kinda like glue in sense
the considered everyone family even though the times were not the greatest for everyone also his parents gave up a lot so he could have a good life in <location>
books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning
spending too much time on the computer is not healthy
i said a little confused
of course a few months later he asked <person> out but i let it go just as <caps> did when <caps> said no to him and they stopped talking to each other
everyone knows that when someone thinks somethings funny they laugh
last we can talk to other people
libraries could take some time to separate the books into categories and the books that they feel are offensive could go into a separate section of the library
that is not good for your health at all
in this memoir there are many times where the author discusses his love for cooking
the first reason why i think people should use computers is it will teach people to have handeye coordination
those <caps> can get the books and <caps> them to help them solve there problems
therefore the cyclist went through some though times
this lets people explore the world and do anything
it was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons
the workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking
the hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills
libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults
another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building
the ending is a cliff hanger to show that her story has not yet completely ended
i had broke my dark days away and started back on my endless trail of humor
but after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her
it was here where i learned the real definition of family
throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face
the greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it
the great thing about you is you can find the information fast and easy
natures winds would complicate the dirigibles from staying still
they teach handeye coordination
i prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative
i told her it was going to be chillier than what <caps> might be expecting
i replied with a simple <caps>
the second was that there dirigibles had hydrogen in it and hydrogen was highly flammable
in my opinion i think that computers help people
you can go now said <caps> teacher
all those years gone in front of the computer
that dose not mean though it should be taken away
we eventually decided to get up and get ready
lets say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out
some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that
the mood made it really easy to understand and read
not the way everyone else wants them to
i was sick so i called <caps> <caps> at her job
then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state
i admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that
these are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers
i remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle
<caps> still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little
true people exercise every day
one time i wanted to go on the web and look to see <caps> there was a in <location>
so why travel when you can see all of it on your computer
this would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the empire state building
book censorship censorship in libraries are a major problem in the <location>
becoming overweight has many health risks liked heart other
by getting a book you know its true
also it teaches good <caps> that you might not have learned anywhere else
there was a time when i borrowed a movie from the public library
since some of the kids in my school who have special needs have a hard time reading
but i started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer
another obstacle was having to get the right equipment
computers can teach you a lot
i very patient and happy to get my first hamster
just learning how to work them is a new skill
for example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that the sight was troubling
that quote shows how close that neighborhood was even though they came from different places
and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term
then he turned them to dust
over the year the flower goes through phases dying then rebirth
emailing is used for many things
he reached into his pocket and pulled out the lone ring
they saw a rocket building kit and asked their dad they wanted it
not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works
the ups and downs and all the animals that await him
this ties up the mood throughout the memoir
so that meant it would be illegal to dock a dirigible on the empire state building
many books in the library systems today contain foul language
many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written
me and my grandpa started loading the luggage into his car so we could head home to meet the rest of my family
computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends
the wait was only half over
the builders ran into quite a few problems when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
<organization> tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch
everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight
every present she got was either a dress or jewelry
another that <caps> the mood thankful is when it says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
so instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do
he had a positive attitude as it states with strong legs and a smile on my face
<caps> it was a lot of kids at her house <caps> she had to clean up the house before her mom come home
magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music
many people say yes and many say no
we walked together to go and look for them and i was right
this would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip
the mood of friendliness is displayed from his passed in paragraph <num> it says
the parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking
the setting of the next land mark was similar to the last
we would go there and mainly go to the kids section
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
so thats just something ill have to deal with
the cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you
computers are everywhere theres never a job that does not have a computer
i believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it
he falls in love with a man named <person> and begins to have sexual relationships with <caps> of the men in his cell
be a parent or responsible child if you are against censorship
we had all the components needed to have the best night of our lives
for students it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer
thats when i met <location>
they could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be lifetaking
write in your own say about patience
they can go onto <location> and type in any question they want to be answered
the world would be upside down without them
now we could be talking about <money> at the very least
like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor
<caps> remembers his parents rich culinary skills and love of cooking
i have been patient lots of times in my life but this time was really hard to be patient because i was so exited about building
you can use the computer to learn when is the best times to visit that place
the stress of a thousand foot dirigible would have been to much pressure for the original framework of the empire state building
so the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up
next i believe that computers benefit society because <caps> keeps people organized
as i was about to say hello i could hear <location> crying
if so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there
<caps> house is an old house located in the woods
i think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him
this could lead to loss <organization> jobs laziness
people believe in many different things and like many different things
so never will i think that the library should be censored
<caps> lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night
her dad told her to wait until we got to <location> so we could stop somewhere
the cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place
that means you could use it for your home work if you need help
its quicker and a lot more productive
that is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten
i probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life
there are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids
the winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current
he was also grateful that he had house and parents like you did
he talks about how thankful he is to have such a good family and that he can call his home a home
little had i known my brother was planing on taking me with him
you can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want
after she said that i was angry at her and stomped to my room
i feel so much more connected with a person if we laugh together
my friend barely used a computer and always played outside
i love talking and having fun maybe if i was more patient it would be more fun
by concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test
the cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men
patience is one of the best qualities someone could have
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves
although some computers <month> be fairly easy to use companies are constantly trying to increase the difficulty of computers
we had to continue so we tried it again just to sink
most of it had to do with how <caps> grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int <location>
i think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school
let our <caps> not repeat itself
on both of these occasions <person> and i started laughing shortly afterward
i believe these are good altercations to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them
censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem
she tells the teacher that she was the one that made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too
every time i drive through <caps> i think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs
love is all around this house
<person> and i have when we are together
and you know <person>
instead he had <caps> tell me what he said
there are various ways to communicate with people through the computer
this is one of the reasons every book should be on the shelf
as you keep reading you will find out my third reason for being to much and so long in the computers
so one afternoon after school
this was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street
so <caps> got out of the and walked about a <num> of a mile to the ticket booth
the author concludes the story with this <caps> because she really cared the hibiscus
a very expensive problem to fix
the mood created by the author is outstanding
the last mood is a humble one
there <month> be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young
i go to my room ready to sleep
allowing dirigibles to dock to the empire state building was never a safe idea
it could be the next best story for somebody
but who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer
the main obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones
and it was not just those who were related to you but also those who cared for you
people will always have different points of view
lots of music would lose its luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the hottest new things
the rest of the building is a scattering of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned about how to love
why we named my dog <caps> was because he always smelt like <caps>
that is just what i thank
the author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and shell be stranger than she was before
the builders of the empire state building faced problems to allow dirigibles to dock there
<person> had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat
they are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you
it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house
i love going on the computer time to time doing many things i have talked about
this was going to be a roller coaster of a week
that is a <time> i will never forget
finally everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun
when they wanted to make the dirigibles land on top of the building
no one stops and thinks about someone else or their family
no one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom
that can tell you where the uncensored parts are
i thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects <organization> computer usage throughout the <location> if you heard from a young teen
it puts smiles on faces
now i will write one paragraph about each
if they start crying people who are working can be disturbed
you never have to worry about not knowing whats going on
i believe that computers do not benefit society
they were trying to get dirigibles to land on the empire state building
then i have also seen accounts where people have been changed in a good way because of a book
many people have papers and of important information and it could be lost in a blink of an eye
then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope
my last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home
thank you for reading my opinion
one is the bad weather
with computers you are able to plan your life with <caps> output
my friend <person> and i go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit
one obstacle the builders had to face was the amount of wind that was blowing that high in the air
a book is a form of speech
the censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the <location> we have total freedom of the press
they could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep
the subject race might come into play in some books in libraries
another problem with computers is how safe they are
the most important obstacle to overcome was safety
<organization> citizens spend over <money> a year on phone bills
i believe that no book should be denied of this right
we waited another hour and a half for them to finish setting up
then libraries <caps> cease to exist
it also helps the tension
the setting was not in the cyclists favor
my dad can be very patient sometimes
for example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding
the builders of the empire state building faced multiple obstacles when trying to obstruct dirigibles to dock on the top of there building
it makes her feel more confident
computers allowed more jobs to be made and replaced
she asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing
the cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through
<caps> we all laugh at them
children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines
the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends
i know many people who spend and budget their time wisely and still have a great time
i do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy
people need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them
<caps> people think that friends and family important and should stay with them every and a while
i am here to say that computers are not the best way to benefit our society
v or your game and especially not outside so thats why i think a computer has a positive effect on people
<caps> provides a very valid point
another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly to low over urban cities
one feature was that his water supply was running short
they would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers
i thoroughly agree with that statement
you can chat with people typing
this meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy
that person can have there opinion but other people have opinions that might oppose the other persons opinion
it is always enjoyable to me
most songs out are highly offensive and should be in a different section
the winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability
the cyclist had to go through all these problems which made it show that he had determination
lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic
<caps> smiled and replied <caps> you laugh i feel calm and know that i am going to be alright
many good things can come out of just being patient
no matter how far away they go
so the next day after lunch i let my little cousin <person> play in the backyard after he was done eating
the next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature
is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong
now reading this i hope you believe that computers benefit society
we even had him laughing so hard that he was crying i guess you could say we are pretty funny when we are together
the <caps> is affected in many ways
lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research
had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have
next he noticed the changes in the terrain
i was shy and felt <caps> stomach starting to do flips which was never a good sign
and that was the time i was patient see ya
now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault
the cyclist felt relief later on due to the features
did you ever turned on your <caps>
the greatest obstacle to their successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
so honestly it cant be that bad
i needed help doing everything
lets say someone has what looks like a normal fever and you just say thats what they have
thats suppose to be a love poem
most of the people who do that are the people who are mostly on the computers
<caps> offered me a <date> job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work
trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
even though they faced many obstacles they successfully completed the empire state building
<caps> final reason is that computers help out with sports
one example that describes this is from paragraph <num>
hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage
also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process
also because of the false information
i want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry
regardless of who is reading it
that <month> not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone
these are some of the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced
therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship
the features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not
com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate
many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh
as you can see computers effect many people in a negative way
they need to go out and enjoy nature
you can even get work for students at school so that way the can learn more and do different activities
its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon
children should read books that meet their age group
we all started to pother
fun help kids and help older people get together
when we are assigned a project we need to do research on a topic and the fastest and easier way is by computer
say we take everything off the shelves off every store that is offensive in any way to people
can come to a person in multiple ways
there are various reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people
it might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know
its just apart of life
the connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair
the last obstacle was the law
this is why i think that computers are very great and useful
with a computer you could research anywhere you want and make that trip the best days <organization> your life
when your at the doctor you will still be done being patience
the first problem was safety
this final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing
i have to have patiences in <num> block <num> block is moth
they came selflessly
authors have just the same right as we do
<person> answered it and heard <caps> on the end
i always hear about people saying how bad the band <person> a
it just depends on how you feel about what has been written
dirigibles were trying to figure out how to dock to the building yet most dirigibles failed
so with reminder of her home she is give both comfort and confidence
computers teach handeye coordination
exercise is a very key aspect in anyones life
this makes me think of drama
patience is about waiting for something for a long time
it brought peoples attention to recent happenings
there were plenty of obstacles the builder faced it trying to allow the dirigibles to dock here are some
i personally feel that computers are an advantage but also disadvantage
no buildings are around the cyclist
you <month> think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did
and there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water
i had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger
we then looked at each other and laughed and ran to do our work before mom and dad got home
he yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so i jumped off the fourwheeler and ran over to him
another reason why libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well
i tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color
laughter is a major component in a relationship
the cable was called a tether
this is something we hear everyday
<person> and i are just like any other couple
another example is the games that people are playing
a second reason why i do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed
this happens to many people in their sports
people need to know what happened in the past with historical events
the veterans then might want the movie taken of the shelves
the situation would have been much worse had it been over <num> stories in the air
the setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces
books teach us about what wrong and what is rite
patience is one of the things that people need to have
i was playing a football game on a great sunny <date> <time>
people should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music
my now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger
the author completes the mood by stating that his parents created a home by being loving and caring and accepting other refugees that came into the united states
so i waited and waited
another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in <location>
<caps> had to go in three days and he was even more scared because hes going by himself this time
it was going on before we got here and when we leave its still going to be going on
computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic
every person poses their own opinions on life
this says so in the last sentence i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
so i believe that people should get of the computer and exercise
the settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood
it would be a really fun family trip
i was finding myself to get more impatient everyday
write to your local newspaper
this shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus
my favorite sport is baseball and i am pretty good
his life consisted of waking up in the mornings walking to school and being ignore by everyone around him
i think it is a bad thing to have them on the shelf in a library
the child <month> get in trouble by there guardian
this is the mood i think that the author created in the memoir
one of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything
i believe <caps> are exceptional writers and promising producers and artists
this shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting
the main affect is the lack of water
that takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material
while working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer
the music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner
it will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information
people who are around me think that i am fun to be with because they could feel the joy i bring to them
a computer is more educational than what most people would think
the entire idea was eventually dropped by the late 1930s
sacrificing all they had in life
more and more people use the computer
middle school was a challenging environment
truly if you decide to take out classics like <person> we lose not only knowledge and the story we lose our freedom
the obesity rate has increased between then too
he waited a long time
this show that the mood is friendship because his parents taught him friendship his whole life
if they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay
i was getting very wet and board i really wanted to see the fish
lets keep are children and young adults away from violence
depending on the persons perspective laughing <month> not be a element of <caps> to them but to me it is
on my way to <location> to visit my dad
second of all computers people to talk to other people around the world
she ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life
now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on <caps> or a newspaper
it brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends
please read on so i can explain my reasons
i was patient when i was on my way to <location> to see my <caps>
i support advances in technology
this is very easy and this way you can stay close to them
they also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation
the joke <caps> told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard i had trouble breathing
i think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together
the author is grateful because her parents came to <location>
if people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life
one feature would be the dryness of the land
the biggest water slide there
i had to sit in a waiting room for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do
then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page
what helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this <date>
i also know people who use the computer the right way and they are very happy people
people can stay away from those areas that they find offensive
both me and my mom had to be patient
it made no difference to them if i trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy
the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened
i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
one time i had to try and <caps> my patience was before a <organization> football game
i can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience
i was glad that i was patient that day
being patient means to wait for something that <month> take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude
one year i found out the my great grandmother died of cancer
we waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us
i believe i was changed by that small effort
after that i told myself i can be patient
the <caps> <caps> could be <num> years of <caps> to enter the room
the door bell rang and i sprinted to the door
they also said that on being on the computer has taking more teens <organization> the streets and in their homes
like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts
computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment
you always see ads for dating websites and other things like that
theres your map with just a click of the cursor
but i could read any book i wanted to
for <caps> what i am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster
every morning she waits on me to finish getting ready
i believe that <person> agrees
laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table
ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water
a quick kiss with <caps>
to support a claim like this i will provide evidence
i also think this sentence from paragraph <num> supports the author wanting you to feel grateful
only fun and energized people get out and get active
so my mom and dad talked about it
and how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad
i had to be so careful of my arm
when we got back to my aunts house none of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night program called <caps> <caps>
they can teach people many things
<caps> being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science
we were both thinking about this big barrel that had been left in the track at our school
if some people like to chat with each other they use cell phones
unfortunately many problems lay in the way interning this theory into reality
wonder how he was going to survive
i think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science
he was not patient at all that day
originally from <location> parents immigrated to the united states in 1956
my older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away
the setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice
there just a lot of thing you can do on a computer
one <money> the most important reasons why people need computers is because computers can help you learn about and research other things going on in the world
<month> came around one more month of school
one of these problems was a big safety issue
g this whole day you have been patient
all good qualities that make everyones lives easier
ill also wait until <date> again
in the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake
when <caps> an author must take this into consideration
i have now been living here for four years
i always go home with a smile
the architects faced many obstacles in trying to adding mast onto the design of the empire state building
some books <month> have material that might not belong in the hands of children
my mom being <caps> patient
i love them all very much
the second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it
there were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
i have never laughed harder than that in my life
at that moment i realized laughter will be the connection between us forever
one was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen a very flammable gas
the blimps load and pressure from the wind would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
doing exercise is good for your health
there are so many ways to handle a situation like this its just how you handle it
in the <caps> the <caps> people are given many rights that are often taken for granted
this makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop
or try it for themselves
you would not believe the technology they have and how they use them
i kept saying over and over again in my head my number i was given
during that camp i found out the truth
i got in the huge line
censorship in libraries should not be mandated
<date> they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy
the architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top
one serious obstacle was that the dirigible moored at the top of the build held only by a tether would stress the buildings frame
the mood in this memoir is very relaxed and proud
being patient is a very difficult thing to do
lastly they can be extremely dangerous to children
the memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community
it is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf
and when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that i have to stop him to wait for the group
his tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture
one major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts
what happens when someone says the bible is offensive
when it comes to someone thinking that a movie or book has gone to far with their race then censorship gets thrown around
i love my laugh because it is part of who i am
which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy
the builders of the empire state building faced a few obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
people have to realize that thats life
i <caps> not know for sure if <caps> did hear or see us mocking her
recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately
this happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and <caps> your reading or seeing at the same time
some books that are intended would be better off staying in the library
due to this law it would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
he believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump
i think it is an excellent thing to have
it made me feel like even through hard times people can find the good in things
this allows the reader to feel such love and happiness which is being expressed
<caps> is an example of keeping in town with someone else
computers are wonderful
starting from the beginning how his family passed on their traditions
well i think they should not be sitting on their damage their eyes
i went to cedar with my friend <person> last <date> or <num> <date> ago
the mood of courage of his parents moving to the united states
that is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library
i met them both in entirely different ways
laughter says the same thing all around the world
another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles
we paid our bill left no tip and left
i hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place
i believe <caps> gives people handeye coordination and a way to be organized
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
all you have to to is go to <caps>
the mood created by the author was mostly happiness and thankfulness
its the best way for people to learn what life is really like
then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left
i soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got
adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building
but if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing
another mood is that he is grateful
this basically made even attempting to dock in illegal
just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer
some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends
more over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds
they are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it
there is no point in taking books off the shelves
communication through the computer is very popular
they had trouble with the area thing where they were going to do their job
i would not like any books removed from libraries
i would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day
builders with that would have to construct the building to make it more stable
computers can really be bad with our education
to the past stressed because i never had a to just relax and think about things i computer doing something or homework
you can talk to people faster this way and its much easier
computers are a very good thing for kids to have
closing the door behind him
he keeps stating over and over that he is so grateful of his parents and family members
from my perspective i think it should stay the same
personal experiences are also have a place
where ever you go there is always some sort of <caps>
he also had problems with his parents and brother
as well as do other things as well as the same time
we cant help what people did in the past
one obstacle was the wind
it makes me happy when i hear one of my friends say oh <person> you just made my day
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting to dock dirigibles on the mast
one day when my aunt <person> was watching me and all of a sudden all the lights went out
its not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the <caps> of write to publish such a thing
there also useful for work most people use computers for work
the ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies
i could not find the trail and the light was getting closer so we both jumped full speed straight in to a big bunch of bushes
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelfthat work i abhorthen you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
another opinion is that i think people should not spend most of there time on the computer
then they will be mad and then that just an other fight
one obstacle the builders faced was finding a way to have a dirigible moored on top of the empire state building without adding stress to the buildings frame
you meet new people when you are in the computer
<person> tried to run but he slipped and fell
it was like they took my kitchen and painted it a different color and then put it there
there is no way i want my child watching some violet movie
you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you
this shows that he is grateful for all the extended family members he has
there is a thing called the clean version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it
to me that is a pretty cool invention
i started to get mad
my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer
<caps> and <person> came over to sit with me as i waited for the show
it also is happy because of all the great times he had there
i believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves
well you could by chatting with them on the computer
teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting
this eventually led to the mast never being used as a docking station
sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free
one problem was strengthening the buildings frame
thats why i believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people
where going to talk about your you bring on the computer all you would with your family
the mood is positive and keeps the reader interested and involved
the biggest obstacle to face was nature itself
book <caps> and the characters lived happily ever after
inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page
once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted
it really close make things go faster
after a while she planted the flower in the vegetable garden
i am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time
regularly joined us at our table
one concern was that a way could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below
having an account like this is said to be addicting
i left the house feeling a bit tired but great
so the computer actually helped with real life activities
notice that <caps> have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended
they came selflessly
the dirigible was held by a single cable tether and the dirigible was about a thousand feet
throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents
we shared everything we had the same favorite color same hair we even had the same friends
by censoring what products are published and put in public takes away that right
the builder of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there
i have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better
that was a very dark period in history
a small amount of hope had settled over everything once again
i know this because in the memoir <person> said i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
people of the <location> have the freedom of speech and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right
the three of them laughed for the next five minutes while the midwife simply smiled and the baby lay sound asleep in the strong arms of her father
the child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better
they also augment the information i use
adults are affected just as much and just as easily
the computer is very educational
without computers society is because computers help the soldiers to win wars and even help people to live
my dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him
my greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times
the mast on the empire state building had too many problems for the <caps> to solve
think of what not having a censor on the libraries can cause
just try to understand what there trying to say to you
if libraries start censoring books we <month> end up with less and less readers as the years go on
i hope you have had some great laughing moments spent with the people you love and care about
it took me eight months to fined he
this gives you a chance to discover <caps> people with the same interest as you
the builders could not possibly overcome nature and its violent air currents for the winds they the top of the building
my knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons
i know this from experience
so why would you remove valuable information
would add stress to the buildings frame
and when someone asks him what is wrong or <caps> he is okay <caps> seems that he just gets more angry
his abnormality was taking a toll on the family
this part of terrain shows its effect
computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age
this creates a loving and family mood
laughter is the shortest distance between two people
there is no doubt he will get dehydrated
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
sometimes he gets even more angry
barking at the squirrels in the backyard to keeping me warm at night
the large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned grape juice factory added to the hopeless lost tone
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town
it also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate
so this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age
so take them out is some of the parents are saying now a days
there is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a <caps> rating
the mood created by the memoir is thankful and proud
it would make the story more clear
also if you had to look up a person for a school project
but i think it is calm because the way the way that he speaks its in a calm tone
this is simply untrue
the people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read
in my opinion i think that computers are a good thing
<person> is grateful that his parents moved to <location> to give him a good life
libraries are serious places and should be treated as such
and giving details on showing people reading this article is that technology of computers also help <caps> save
about <percent> of people say that they are addicted
the first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute
i say that computers are addicting this is a fact <percent> of students spend most of there time on the computer
censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own
their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice
i mean its that simple
we thought it was not fair
in the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist
he learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him
if computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem
i played first with a lady who used <caps> be a nurse
within seconds <caps> screen was <caps> with real and edited pictures of the <caps> flag
the first skill we could learn is typing
whatever a kid sees he will try to repeat it
i need lunch i have to wait for that to
my great grandma also likes to dance and it also hilarious because the dance moves that she knows are far different then the ones today
computer supply so much more then just entertainment
around <num> pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade
the mood created in this memoir is comfort
so soon but oh so far
in the excerpt the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles
and how his parents seemed like great people
here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid
realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as i had thought
i tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of i am happy
thats why i think the mood of the memoir is warm and nice
a time i was patient was when i got my braces
<person> wanted a dog
many find books boring but it will help in the long
the biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the <location> use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium
also helps us keep in contact with others
the final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law
there is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people
in this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not
as he tried to keep going he lost hope and thought he was going to die
being patient that long is humble to me
they even miss out on just going outside and talking a walk the reason is because they are <caps> <caps> inside their house with their fare glued to the computer
a fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time i met my mothers boyfriend
i am not speaking as though everyone who watches a movie or reads a book about a murderer will go out killing people
we have witch is the <caps>
there are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day
another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds
one of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie
there is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children
it would just not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mass on top of the buildings flat roof
you stayed home both times just to be on the computer
it was a beautiful snowy morning on <date>
websites and search engines help you a lot
if you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her
computers do not do that for us at all
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area
this shows how grateful they were
some people say they are good for research and talking to people
another obstacle is wind
all i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh
when he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert
but surfing the web for countless hours is their choice
she got shot by her husband
i would be very upset if my child had to see that
i think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves
the other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy
many kids draw disrespectful things in them
the computer helps us with school
memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with
one of the first problems they faced was the buildings frame could not support an enormous dirigible
the dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist
he also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback which he avoided even though it almost covered the road
the mood is very warm and welcoming
some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off
well i believe that having computers around are good because
this gives the story a very loving mood and shows how they are all there for each other
this nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to
we waited at least an hour an a half
the flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother
what better way to be happy when smiling is one step closer to laughing
for example she likes bitter melon it says
the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story
my third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school
you also <month> think that they are not getting enough exercise
people who like to read books should have a wide variety of books
the setting can affect anything
children could take that offensive or violent book into action
it is wonderful experience
in this story patience is the key to everything remember about patience next time you have to wait
i will be telling you about how i think computers are great
i understand that people might have been there first
<person> <person> i got in line to order ice cream cones dipped in chocolate
i hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended
that was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir
well i just cant remember them
after all day of being on the boat it was about time to head off home and get ready for the begging of the week
<person> phone was taken away so the only way i could talk to her was on <caps>
they were loving to all and they sacrificed a lot to get to where they were
i think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to read at their own risk
he appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family
that was the time i was being patient
he appreciates what his parents have done for him
people take things differently than other people might
the <caps> is a strong person and had a lot of good and bad moods in the memoir
we started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to
magazines is a big one
either to do home work or play games
the situation would have been different if it were anywhere else
i caught him looking away at <caps>
censoring is something that i strongly believe in
smiths determination to have the empire state building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast
we played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all
later they had to put a steel needle on top of the empire state building so the balloons could dock up and let people out
whenever it was my moms turn we would laugh because of how she would set herself up to bowl
i think that the <caps>
and they lived patiently ever after
computers also can teach you how to speak a language
especially if the alligator teaches your next class
as <caps> were walking up i though i guess all it does take is patience
the public has to accept those choices
the words in songs can be offensive
thats how the authors mood would be described in the memoir
so get off those computers and call a friend
that <caps> of <date> <caps> was great
so give them time limits
truth be told children hear so much harmful things from everywhere and anywhere
the author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents
i have never laughed so hard in my life
i think maybe that is one reason i am not religious
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles
sometime when u laugh its also harder to breath and your stomach might start to hurt
parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing
there was a girl who had to go to the dentist
he is happy to have a place called home
i thought he did a good <caps> waiting
an for friends this is a good way because if they move you can talk to them on this
not to mention dirigibles were thought of being the transportation of the future
stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances
they stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in with a fish dinner <person> patients caught him a good fish
i returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave
there are many games out there that you <month> enjoy
the builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen
some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes
not doing your school
it is their right as an <caps> to buy what they want
the builders and architects of the empire state building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top
people learn the most information out of a book or magazine
its pretty easy and everyone knows that too you know
just use your computer keyboard to type and send a message
but on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer
this young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes
i think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until they got back on their feet
my third and last quote is my mother and father had came to this country with such courage
we new what we were going to have to do so as soon as i see <person> take off i took off
people get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese
then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book
things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available
being with your family can make your bond between each other stronger and you can get along with each other better
<person> wanted to play on his play station
about <percent> of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and gratitude
he searches for a place to rest where there <month> be water but he is not able to
the author love his parent for the love and sacrifice
we sat there for over an hour
com that give you daily news
people can get addicted to it so easily
computers just add to list of excuses not to do anything
the empire state building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of air ships
computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country
in my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people have many interesting in many topics in the library
when <caps> finished we both started laughing so hard that it hurt
reason one you loose interaction with people
so even if they fixed the other problems it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles
hydrogen is way more flammable than helium
<caps> example theres a show called dateline
when we got to the <organization> we had know idea why we even went there
computers are slowly making people less educated
i <month> be angered by what i see
i do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it offensive or inappropriate
so much is missed because of computers
my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us
patience is a virtue
i think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries
i think this because nobody should be offended by anything
everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions
this number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer
this caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
people find things offensive everyday
and that was the time i was very patient
patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed
about <num> month ago i ordered new riding boots
simply follow the rating rules
people make their own decisions and that is their right
the authors said he will never forget his own family
that same day i came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing
the greater reason was the issue of safety
another reason computers effect the lives and people <caps> the dangerous chat rooms
while we were waiting <person> was searching for the restroom
there is always someone that has a different opinion of things
<time> that <time> the boys thought <caps> would be fun if they played cops and rubbers
my dad was pretty upset that my brother and i were accused of stealing
the truth is no one is able to keep everyone happy
the features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways
the builders of the empire state building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there
i threw a little party for myself at my house
seconds later shes back in the ring for round two
other ways lived you could as
it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope
one day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today <person> was going to get to come home with me and my <caps>
dirigibles were basically given up on by the 1930s
patience is always the hey
the library should have a variety of books if not what if the point of a library
i remember when i wanted to ride my dirt bike and my dad was busy and i waited till he had time to put gas in it
it is a heavy decision to make but the decision could make or break the publishing group or legal party
even though the dirigibles was going to be hooked on top of the building the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building
my step grandmother threw the fish back
its a debate that has gone through several libraries over the content of the material
this is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it
if you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent
it would be hard to teach about these horrible events without offending people
you will find a micro computer thats capable of surfing inter playing music just smaller size then before
although i did already say a while back that i got to be the first cousin to hold her
that was a time i was patient so i could do something fun
i think you would find more things about that person that you would in books
the line for the red <organization> was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first
eight hard eyes moved at the same time watching the same thing
even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today
the author thanks his parents for their kind and loving actions
my last reason why i say that you should spend more time with your family is because you could learn a lot about you family
always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make
the tears stopped coming to my eyes and i really realized the whole situation
there were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
these things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger
in my opinion computers have greatly contributed to technology
another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do
people always look for some kind of entertainment and the first place they ever go is the computer
they might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like
so let everyone read what they want when they want
people from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive
keeping a persons attention is critical
this proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances
my second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because
we are together to this day
it shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands
i feel that it should be censorship in libraries
computers have truly played a vital role in our education
it started to rain and of course it was on outdoor concert
the second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building
there is no way to express my gratitude shows that hes just so thankful there is not way to even express it
as the day progressed the sun was like a tanning booth
the car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air
it brings a happy mood
it seemed like another boring day in hell from what i could tell
she is very shy and quiet
thanks for the conversation
so all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them
i say this <caps> his family always let people from the neighbor hood come over and they were like family
you need to have a limit
studying or writing essay in my grade mostly
but in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful
she is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test
so sometimes you have to wait <num> minutes until they can finally help you
he taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever i need a laugh i think of the last time i saw him
she was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder i laughed
the cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey
the environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward
<caps> was very comfortable in his home and <caps> loved it
this proves how intense his ride was
just want to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town
it supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about
when kids check their emails they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote them
the days are getting shorter lets live it like
a few months ago i spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours
in this paragraph i will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist
the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist
the technology of a computer is farther than any other item
you can break this paragraph down to mean many different things
so you wont have to worry that you wont have enough money when you got there
it was sticking out of my mouth and there was nothing i could about it
there are millions and millions of websites about places and people
the author of this memoir creates a very calm mood
<person> asked watching every step
after telling her all about it she said that i should try to just be myself and eventually i would make friends
i heard a slight giggle underneath her sniffling
i looked over my right shoulder just in time to see <caps> gasping for air because she was laughing so hard
it would add unwanted stress to the building frame
almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time
whenever <person> wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with <person> play computer
i believe that laughter is a big part in having friends
the hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well
we all laugh and have a good time and everyone likes everyone and its fun to be apart of a team that is always laughing and having a great time together
these are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on the society
the author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success
<person> had just got a brand new hamster toy
everyone started to laugh when <person> cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard
some of the material <month> be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them
it was a <date> <time> and i had to go to school but i was acting very patient so my mom would think its time for me to have my new phone
another difficulty was the way the mast was built
laughters bright tone is a good way to get people comfortable and relaxed
i feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the bad things that they are doing
the wins on top of the building are always changing because of dangerous air currents
here is why i say this
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries
in public if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble
in the memoir the author creates many moods with in it
libraries enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age
the media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to
<person> and i talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing
nobody just sits home and does nothing those days
the weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him
some say that the computers are good for the society
the reader feels this love when reading the line
this means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season
such as in war books the characters curse a lot
his cheeks were cherryred with embarrassment
businesses thrive in other countries
the way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the en time boot
and this year he had some side kicks two ducks i named them <caps> and <person>
magical as in how fast and <caps> it takes to make one of us laugh
social lives are very affected by what they learn and how they learn the material
with out even knowing i fell asleep from the gas
even when we got attitudes with <person> he was still a patient man
a third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous
while computers are helpful in our lives too much of one thing is never a good thing
my first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people
thank you for taking you time to read this letter
watch certain movies because they scare there kids
this is because it would add stress to the frame which could be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
i was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch
what i mean when i say homework is when you have to type up an easy or something
this went on for about <num> minutes straight
that <percent> of people benefit from using the computer
to value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen
he listened to some old guys and he lost his way
arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family
this is shown when she says a blossom of two would have blown into the well it reminds her of her homeland
for example i have no patience whatsoever so i cant deal with anyone younger than <num> years old
the library is a great resource for any information
<caps> we hurried out into any <num> graders paradise
like this one the mean patience is very important
the builders of the empire state building seem blind of all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast
this helped me because i talk to one of my friends in <location> and just recently sent an email to my aunt
this whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one
students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone
every body in this world has their likes and dislikes
the third problem was that there was a law in place
<person> groaned again and crossed her arms
i saw <caps> was going her wordsearch <caps> i started to help her
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
this website is even more dangerous then <caps> or <caps>
that how i have patiences
i can think of many books that could be taken offensively that are still on many school library and public library shelves
he also mentioned that he learned the meaning of family while living in that house
one obstacle was that countries other than the united states used hydrogen rather than helium
some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting
was another practical reason
i wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there
it was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles
the average bill per month is <money>
he did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him
people always say laughter is a big part in a relationship
what was funny about him was <caps> ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip
the kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours
libraries could even consider censoring some of their books
i scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades
my dad kept reminding me
thats why i think <caps> should have a room for things that might offend certain people
i dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk
those who support advance in technology believe that computers have a positive affect on people
so i decided to go around the house and try the front door
if books are being taken of shelves based on a few people opinions then their rights are being infringed upon by the people who deemed it inappropriate
the human brain is a piece of work
when something is written it is written for a purpose
there was about <num> people waiting in line with us
nature itself would ruin the time frame of building
computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends
the mood of the excerpt is very bright
some times when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because <caps> not treating people right
but all things are good in moderation
these plans for the new age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen
she then sees them overhead flying in a v
the way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say
i think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood
the mood created by the author in the memoir is love
computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society
one of the greatest obstacle was because of safety
others that i know choose not to read it because of the offensive content
we sat for <num> minutes band then we hear the doctor calling my name
then i got the <caps>
it was the perfect start to our perfect relationship
finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling ever
<caps> now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination
the hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water
the author states that i often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that i could have ever done
i think this because there can be somethings that you <month> not want your children to read
he thank them for teaching him so many things as a child and the environment he grew up in
this is needs to stop
and hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society
it landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown
she also explains her past with such detail and care
one reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise
from that day <organization> had patience
she knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better
will effect their life in some way
that is why she concludes the story that way
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
more public places should start a system of them
computers are a good way to talk to friends that you <month> not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time
the author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph <num>
although we have the amendments there are still restrictions on what we are aloud to publish
but looking back on the same occurrence you just have to laugh at how silly it was
both <person> and i loved books
i walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when i saw <person> sleeping on the coach
we were listening to music and talking about stuff
these were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the empire state building
happy is one of the moods because there are many happy memories in the memoir
over <percent> of the <organization> owns at least one computer in their house
this feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated
laughter kept me in perspective of <caps>
people would get boring because they have no patience
another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
he looked down and said <caps> sorry for what i did
some people <month> find that offensive and some <month> not
i laughed and said <person> is dead
imagine your child or someone that is very close to you
two hours fly by and the girls got it
this is really helpful <caps> you want to learn about people from around the world
they might not want to be around you as much
students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries
so yes take them away
well laughter can make your day great
i was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder
also <caps> save your to save the trip out there
then he would say that i should try to play it
it was during the <date> and we decided to have ourselves a little movie night at <organization> house
you are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books
these computers are bad for people
they are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself
your family is important so you need to spend time with them
you can find your information and make something out of it
they have <caps> many features
we sat in the car for one note hour waiting and waiting and waiting
they had to find a safe way of mooring airships to this mast
the empire state building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it
or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of
all was looking really good
visit a local park or play a sport for fun
my birthday was <num> on <date>
freedom is the key to any way of living
he is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him
that was how <caps> was actually voted in
for some reason some people went to stay inside on the computer but other go outside on a good warm day
then you have to wait for a shot
all they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later
more people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone
there was a time when me and my cousin <person> did not really like each other but i had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town
this sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal
letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents
in the making of the empire building the builders faced some problems
let me tell you something i hate the dentist
you can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation
once again i do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive
<caps> waited a total of <num> hours and <num> minutes
this law was set in place for safety reasons
sports <caps> prides its self on that
it says in the the mooring mast that at the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
we had a good time she said that she liked us laughing and having a good time
i believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of medias content would prove suffice
i believe that there can be both good and bad effects
i think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing
you have seen my views and what i believe
experiences difficulties without complaining
we can learn <caps> that are going on from far away
my friends moms changed because she got a computer
this was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself
some of the older people <month> think different and others they <month> think the same
landing the dirigibles would be a hard task
i believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf
people are saying that computers have a negative effect on people
she ventures to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences
as it was mentioned in the article the idea of the dirigible was destined to never fulfill its purposes
it would have been impossible to keep the back of a dirigible from swiveling around
parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in
the <caps> <caps> <caps> <caps> <caps> <person> is an essential for me to survive this crazy thing called life
college takes a seal of years
the feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
so we all just sat down a waited
they <caps> give people the ability to learn information faraway places and people
but i suffered through it
another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer
as i thought of a bullet proof plan that would be very funny
then it disrupts that persons study
which this means slow down or you will have an accident
my first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them
but you can get emails and instant message ways
but then i thought hey give the kid a chance he might just get it so i just kept on helping him
i always keep sending words wrong
the conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist
the author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why
it was a card so it had to have money in it
the more you know could just save the world
laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships
the space craft stop in the field
too <caps> which leads to lack or exercise
<caps> ran off with a very big smile on her face
out of all the <organization> i have had that <organization> was the best <organization> ever
i know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her
lets just say nobody has beaten that card
soon i became more accurate
some people find some offensive subjects interesting
so the way i see it everyone should be entitled on what books they can choose
many hardships were brought about trying to dock dirigibles at the empire state building
those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
this made it illegal to try and dock at the empire state building
my friend <person> often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents
they say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere
libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in <caps>
they want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home
i already know the answer
i understand that computers could take control of people and people would spend to much time on them
one way that he expressed this in the memoir was by saying that his man had let in other immigrants to their house
and i would like to let you know what i think about the whole situation
there are my opinions why a computers have a positive effect on people
computers help us with our education
i go to the doctors every <num> months
<caps> took about five steps before <caps> stepped in a small hole the perfect size for his foot to fit in and <caps> fell flat on his face
he had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising
a time when someone was patient was when a guy named <person> was driving and a little girl named <person> was walking on the side walk and it was a red light
the builders of the empire state building face a lot of problems on trying to make a dock for dirigibles
i believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some
this is an essay by <person>
this statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way
we must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer
the mood of this memoir is nonfiction
the conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough
if someone at the age of nine can check out a <caps>
some people like to play games
we sat down at a table in a restaurant of the hotel
the cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some
shes going to the store a couple hours late she is no bake with a hot
the author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons
things like that should not be in a public library
we get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens
through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved
computers have made things a lot impact on children but we all new things i when we use computers
<caps> my mom said that he might not get to it that day
another reason that are using and want to learn more
but one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable
she said you have to be patient
i had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings
the builders faced many problems in their attempts to allow a dirigible to land at the empire state building
i was going to sit here for a few hours so so <num> <caps> ill read something
it made it peaceful because the author gives the reader the feeling that their was nothing to worry about
computers are too useful
the mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy
you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you
and that makes your whole day worth it
culture and history are two very important aspects of the world
most of the time people are home bound but need a job
those books and things is not very bad they actually help
we had to wait a while to find the deer but it was wroth it
children follow in their parents footsteps
<caps> i cant seem to find it
the rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit
one card is just to check out regular books
there were many problems with the designing of the dirigible docking system
books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we <month> have never thought about before
i modeled after her likes and dislikes
when you turn a house into a home you feel comfortable in it because you have many comforting and loving memories in it
a time when i was patient was <num> for <caps>
this makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated
when the geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning
i went and talked to my sister for the first time in days
it was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible
during this memoir he is very excited and thankful for the family he has
those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
his perspective on the dilemma helped me get through it
to one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion
<caps> of all he explains how much his house meant to him
they should have a section just for that kind of music
it must have been very hard to construct the mooring mast
the author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic
i sat down and collected my thoughts trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation
also the architect met with president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the pacific ocean
you just gotten make that type of change
when i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on a <caps> <caps> <caps>
we have the obligation to keep the <caps> that we have created alive
typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor
the cyclist settings hinder him in the essay rough road ahead
then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home
should be censored in some cases
my first reason <caps> i mentioned before was it would give us intelligence
throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had
sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps
these are how the features affect the cyclist journey
then they burn down the house with the mans belongings still in it
another reasons i would like you to hear is less time exercising
they had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work
thats when <caps> said i <caps> wait
there are times that you spend with another individual that will makes steps towards sticking together
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
my opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time
this communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future
after school i went to swim practice and after practice he was still at the pool waiting for his brother
the conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it
we took off and headed home
i believe that is true
this makes life easier for many people
everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship
this was suppose to be a fun fishing trip but it was now a game of survival
we are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies
my older sister <organization> i jumped in line <organization> began to wait
secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world
once they put something out there they cannot take it away
i arrived at my <caps> house at about one thirty on the dot
one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area
you can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it
one of the obstacles were the crowded <caps> they had for the dirigible
this information can spread across the school
the actors and crew were doing such an amazing job with the play but i knew i had my work cut out for me
she makes me laugh and is always there when i need her
lastly there was an existing law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas
also some books that are offensive shows students to not do the things they see in the book
they make it easier to find information and typing skills
now were all thinking great their goes our opportunity to redeem ourselves from a terrible <time>
you could live in <location> and email someone in <location>
attaching a thousandfoot dirigible to the top of the buildings frame would add stress to the buildings frame
we went again and they told us we had to sign a paper
this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful
so get right up and decide
i have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning
lastly laws prevented flight so close to the ground
the worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents
the cart was half way
he says his parent were selfless and took in refugees in their home
i believe that books that are found offensive should not be censored
i believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this
i have given you three reasons on <caps> view of censorship in libraries
i went to my more and told her what happened
as the leader on the team you cant just act defeated as you feel
so i think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again
about an hour later i got picked up by <caps> dad
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
a kid <month> grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it
one of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me
then that one special book you wanted to read is now off limits
many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this
i work at a restaurant in my town here in <location> as a waitress
in plus the computer was getting boring
i believe computers positive effect in people
books should not be taken off the shelves in a <caps> at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner
the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop <organization>
what is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that persons point of view
i think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the build for our children to read
its even bigger than that
that meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop
com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time
i was going to the same like i said
these are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
these differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable
the dirigibles would not be able to tie to the dock and stay because of violent air currents
its a big problem for you
video chatting lets you see someone and talk to them practically face to face from thousands of miles away
computers are harmful to our society
on things around the world
m because we had to ride the bus back to <location> early because it was <date> and the buses run only for a little bit
when she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips i started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor
he made me feel like i was invited to his home with open arms and i could feel the environment around me
i really <caps> like making her smile
then the waitress put us at a circular table
then out came the eight point bunch i shot him through the heart and lung
people do stupid things just to make others laugh
<organization> says out of his dumb brain of his we should go over there and throw rocks at those cars you guys
those kinds of music must be remove from any school library or any public library
these are the obstacles that the builders had to face
but some day and every day after that i will be to patience for everybody
in conclusion computers are great machines
having a computer you could do a lot of homework
<caps> family watched me open them
some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it
they travel places with people at their fingertips
one of the best parts of the hike is when we see the deadend section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago
most dirigibles coming from outside of the united states were filled with hydrogen
there is not much that can be helped with that
the mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood
what they <month> not like could very be what others do like
driving from <location> to <location>
it is only natural to disagree with someone
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building
also it is an ending that is open
her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter
i was doing a waterdepleting <num>
sports are something that everyone loves to participate in and something that everyone likes
computer affect us in a negative way that can change the course of our life
luckily my story is of great laughter
the final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
by growing up in such a wonderful place he will always never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a home
the removal of these things <month> become harmful to a new generation in the long run
it allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in
thats the mood the author gave
my brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for
thats the first thing a teenager does right when they get home from school
thats just the part of the world
i like when her mom let anybody to there household to the table
you could write a paper on the computer for example read on to see how i support my reasons of why computers are helpful in peoples lives
a lot of people we very rude to her
my friend <caps> is a daredevil
so long these obstacles were faced in attempting to allow docking
if the library was privately owned then the owner could decide to put whatever books they wanted into it and censor whatever books they wanted to
my friends and i could not agree on where to go swimming though
theres more than one obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there
the library has educational movies for children that <month> not be available anywhere else
i think they just need to suck <caps> up and move on
that would be on the parents plate to deal with
i can relate this to my brother with his dis
<person> glided into the room with a welcoming spirit about her
this is happening more and more frequently
another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
so he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer
good thing <organization> noticed and remembered about <person> ex later that day
if they took all inappropriate books out of they library
the cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water
one day i got a phone call from my aunt
the winds would shift the ship and it would be very difficult to land on the mooring mast
that shows a good <caps> because it is about loving
i was sitting in the waiting room at the <organization> <caps> <caps>
this affected his mood because he had hope again
another important thing to remember is that computers are important is because they help you get more educated
first of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise
parental concern for their children is also a factor
the first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion
throughout the memoir he describes his parents like heroes and thanks them for everything they did for him
so one laugh or giggle could make turn it all around
no one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology
maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life
the cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth
when a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so
he told me that the whole time he was watching me
the only noise you hear is a little sputter of a laugh coming out of someones mouth every thirty seconds or so
that was a time when i was very patient
computers have very <caps> benefits
in conclusion is a very useful thing
cause either way they going to be able to find away to get it
<caps> reason ties in perfectly with the first
the music in libraries should be censored
next this is good for buyers and sellers
more than <percent> of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers
which i know your parents would like
this <month> be because of the adults extensively more experiences throughout their own life
i feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed
or should we let them understand how it really works
books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be
perhaps we <month> learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so
but for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other <caps>
people also use <caps> and play games on unknown websites
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any us
blocks off things that you think is important for your child
he will be forever grateful to his parents for these lessons that have formed his life
thank you for reading this and have a nice day
no one held a gun to there head and said read the book etc
the greatest obstacle was nature itself
this is how the author creates the mood in the story
so now you now where i stand on the issue of computers
my first reason is to look up information on the computer
his family teach him lots of stuff that why now is have been the basis of his life
the next day we did some activities first we ate lunch before doing any activities
<caps> crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me
we spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad
it also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years
also computers allow us to <caps> us to <caps> more info about recent events that have just around the world
as he started to head out the scenery changed
hydrogen is highly flammable
<person> was the type of guy you could tell anything to
also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her
<caps> and my cousin <person> and my cousin <person> who lived right next to <caps> would always ride bike
one day my dad and i had a doctors appointment at <num> pm so we went there on time
the <organization> uses radar to see if there is any boats or submarines coming near them and the have a heads up if there would be an attack
this means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming
getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment
it was easy to talk to her
<caps> means that you are having a good time
she also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving
those were the <caps> they faced
the snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like diamond back
a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining
they ran into a problem with nature itself
these are the only ideas that i have that would work well
as i wondered the yard looking for her the others started helping me look for her
these are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder
things that made her laugh and giggle
she was old and was in a <caps> <caps> club
he had plat smooth roads to go through
<person> had went to the park with her friend <person> and waited for this fellow named <organization>
that it was a shortcut
that is how computers let people stay in touch
what he was saying was he was grateful to his parents for what they did for him so that makes me feel thankful for my parents
i think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what
laughter is the best way to bring people closer together
that is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life
having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends
because they think that they are bad
builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles well attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
let the pretty picture is about to change
these children eat because they have nothing better to do
you can also keep in touch with friends
i would love to see more censorship in libraries so that we can protect todays children until the parents choose to open their eyes to the world
<caps> next point shows that people are not enjoying nature
on a fine <date> day i was heading toward the <caps> office
while i was in line i started talking to my friends we played games and walked a few steps up every a minutes
i was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down
the setting of this passage played a key role in the story
it told us that the main keys were
that concludes why the mood is joyous
you need to have fun in your life to keep you happy
i met <person> in the sixth grade <caps> class
there was a two hour line and me and my friend were getting bored
they also talked about the great and fun that they had in doing the plays
it helps to wait for things
everyone has a favorite book
business men are not the only ones doing that though
so over all i say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands
computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools
i was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was <num> second long
seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head
the mood portrayed in the story was family and friends are very important and they help what you will be in the future
after he reached the first town he checked his supply
also it usually ships to your house in a couple of days
if its that big of a deal to some adults then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff only worse on t
i was patient enough to wait for my candy
the back of the ship would swivel around and around
they ran into a few problems when it <caps> to building this
<caps> said because i want my pens <caps> <date> present remember the <num> owe me
she says that she will try again
computers are great for school
he finally found hope
there are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive
these three parts set the mood of the story
our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us
that sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else
website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners <caps> also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic
the last paragraph is about the worst prank that me and my little brother have ever pulled
<person> told us we would be doing the mirror exercise
he is so grateful of his neighbors and how they all came together
although id rather eat it than get a lecture on not being thankful
the second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles
there was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable
she was on it all day and all night
in <date> libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism
it causes the world to change very fast
thats what makes everyone special
i was ready to go hunting
we crossed the road and walked to my house
the car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ready or not here we come
the builders of said the dirigibles are weighted down by lead but if they did that it would be a safety issue
kids to a certain age deserve to know whats going to happen in the real world when they grow up and start a life
that is patience in my own way
the winds current would cause the dirigible to drag the building with it because the wind current is very strong
families have been always close to each other
the builders of the empire state building were having many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
this caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop
thanks for your cooperation click
to tell this story i have to go back in time to when i way around nine or so
<percent> of the <caps> surveyed at the <caps> <caps> agree computers are helpful to us
the features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist
another week passed and still not here
the hills would make the trip more difficult
they will stop inviting you places
<caps> often describes the feeling of closeness between her neighborhood and her family
computers are killing us as a nation
the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast
then the bottom level should be the children level
the researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patients brain both before and after using the computer
they have horoscopes and give advise
at the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map
we had to wait a while for her neighbors to stop looking around trying to figure out who was telling them to be quiet
the mood created by the author of this memoir was very warm and loving
censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter
we just need to find it again
arguing just decreases the social time spent
censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world
the last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard
a <caps> time ago when i was about <num> years old
i you cant get if then you will be forced to get it by stealing
if i was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me
this means that their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help
once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m
i think it does and hope that you agree with me
we had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry
should libraries censor reading materials to students at school
this <caps> ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people
being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait
the frame of the empire state building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building
the tone adds to the theme of the story
when i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom
i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
it has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves
now teaching your dog tricks
because other people got <caps> first and act to get served first
to some people the strong words help the reader get the point across their head
new <caps> is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town
statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the <time>
and if was really bad be able to take it out of the school
i once read a book that i found in our school library that was about slavery
my dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm
when riding a bike it <month> not seem to hard
the mood is well many different things
as a child my mom always
after eating lunch which took <num> minutes i decided to watch another movie
<caps> it also has a homey feeling
a third obstacle was that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable
the parents were happy about what they did and who they loved
you can search someone or something across the whole world
one obstacle was the hight of the building
when the dinosaurs went extinct
also i think computers are not good because computers lead to no good so keep your child away from computers
while we were looking at the art the whole time i was thinking about the winning piece
sometimes you will be bored something to do go on computer
so i asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise
making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school
if the person who is reading book or viewing movies that <month> be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it
because of site like these
this realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope
the trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men
libraries should be able to have a variety of different books
by the time we got to practice her and i had been laughing for about ten minuets straight
i think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons
i really enjoy learning about foreign places and culture
history books should not be censored because it is facts and teaching kids on what has happened in the past and how people survived
so it makes it easy on adults as well
also some people have family and friends who live across the world
it would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it
i looked over at him and noticed that he blushed a little and i laughed
we walked another step closer
now with a computer they will have no issue doing that
i can find out what is happening where i live by looking up your newspaper
now days people can get offended over anything
first of all they teach handeye coordination
i like parties and thinking about parties during <caps> makes it a little less <caps> racking
i have lots of stories of when i have maid people laugh
nature is a gift that should be given to everybody
i really need the grade to pass
waiting for package is the worst
this also shows that the mood is happy because the author is grateful
i learned there about how to love
we seen we had one class together and we were excited
change the radio station
he seen how crushed i was on my birthday and because he knew i wanted that pool
the parents cook and celebrate things with the neighbors
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes
builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed
when we got off someone said <caps> go on the <caps> all the adults loved the idea
all of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that
spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising
as the seasons went by she discovered the similarities
obviously i have reason too agree with the statement laughter is the shortest distance between two people because i have that connection in the best way possible
and we always make time to go see our family and friends
and the funny thing is that this happened for the <date> of my life so that the funny thing
i had no friends at all
the computer can make things visual to kids and out
we wait that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long
i know plenty of people who type their feeling because they would never dare say them a loud
but in general i think its helpful
we have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something
the way that the mood shows love is in <caps> <num> and <num>
<caps> also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home
that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
no one knew that was our <date> <caps> <caps> <caps>
sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better
and the things that was named make the <caps> so fun an peaceful
anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make
we all laughed again
lets not wait any longer
the bus flew around tightly wound corners
people sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy nature
then they told us in which cabin we were suppose to be i had seven cabin members including myself
the ship would swivel around the mooring mast
the greatest reasons for its failure were air currents and safety
since we were only little kids to adults
that is why i am <caps> no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves
it was like a river fellowing down my face
so that computers giving you this ability to learn about faraway places is really helpful to the human society
there also are times where i make others laugh until they cry
as the day grew on the sun was beginning to beat down he was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong
with just a laugh sadness leaves and thats when happiness jumps in
so i honestly feel that libraries for the way they are is to be left alone
also in paragraph seven he says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
some days i never patience with anything
at the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect
so it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it
patience is not complaining about being board on a long car ride
now we started laughing again
for instance i check out <caps> book every week and return the <caps> i checked out the same day i go to get a new <caps>
<caps> when i got mad because it had to be so patient
i was still a nobody
the author also described their friendship with their neighbors
could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds
if thats the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to
we figured that it would be fine though
explosive gases were not the only problem though
books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves
none of my friends would have seen <caps> or told me about it
when i am on the computer to long i know
you could interpret it in different ways
the man started becoming very unsure
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time right for you to try again
we went to the gift shop there
also you can find free work out videos
i sympathized with <person> for having to live with the woman
she was such an amazing person
there have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that i was not ready to learn about
in order to succeed in life in general you must have patience
i soon found out that we were the last to perform and it was at least five hours long
its just not in the cards for me
go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen
i know that a lot of people like to be outside when its a nice sunny day
perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read
the you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
if you meet someone you made friends with on vacation you can email them
it was as if nothing had ever changed
whenever <person> was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and i would always be there for her
it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where i celebrated my first birthdays
this is what i learned about making friends
teaching you parents how to use <caps> is a great responsibility for your actions
because i think she feels hope and faith
getting out of the car we received bear hugs from her
we would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives
when i go to a library i <month> find some stuff that is offensive to me
an example is your waiting for a toy that just came out
i walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer
you might think after reading this letter
this is a good way to conclude a story
library censorship everyone has their favorite book
its about love and family and spending time together
this would be another obstacle the workers encountered
there are new additions daily
it is well known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away
the idea of the removal of offensive material from libraries is understandable
she has grown to her environment like a flower
she is entitled to them
everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills
out of nowhere we hear a weird noise outside our room
my poor little brother
he will love you either way
then <caps> you want to work or go to another school some you need to do it by computer
but instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun
laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free
one main problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the united states use hydrogen instead of helium
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhor then you have the exact same right and so does everyone else
when you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life
my mom was driving me to school and she said when i pick you up today i have surprise for you at how
a whole new feeling overcame the room
i would come to along this breeze jaunt
he sent us a letter saying that they were keeping all the trooper for an extra six months
men <caps> sometimes more on and patient and sometimes not so much
the setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route
we spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint
i would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people
if <caps> are not happy in life then everything <caps> have or worked for means nothing
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
the next thing i knew we were running as fast as we could down the mountain with seemingly thousands of wasps following us
i made a snobby comment and i at one of the tables
but the glue took <num> hours to dry
we had to see <person> as a friend not a foe
well that all changed one night when we decided to go to the <location> and play a few rounds of <caps>
and also there was a law that air crafts had to be a certain height in the air
the mood the author created in this memoir was very proud
her parents care about others and keep there doors open for them at all times
i told my dad to just be patient the food will be right out any minutes
by the time we got to <organization> that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that <person> and i had quoted each other for
every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life
i think they should say the same when i go to use my computer
this would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning
<caps> was one of the first speeches i had ever met all of the requirements on
i knew that this was going to be bad
you can also listen to the radio on a website
i really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me
computer says computers are information in a compact <caps> out of <caps> people use the computer learn about far away places
i had horrible nicknames for a long time
i was nervous because if i win i will get two tickets to <location> <caps>
<caps> mom calls from upstairs
everything was set up perfectly
this is where a problem occurs
i feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library
they looked like they had both seen a ghost
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building
we should choose how long were using one computers
and there have always been there proving i can count on them
materials are made for a reason
their brain tells them to do things that are illegal
for example in the memory it say that i would never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
being so high the dock would be moved around because of the winds
i got my coat off the rack followed by little brother
i remember when i went to <location> to visit my stepgrandmother for <caps> and went fishing
another reason is that his friends and family is all he got
same with <caps> of <caps>
<caps> would have took about <num> years longer to crack the code of the genes of we did not have computers
by taking out some books not everyone would be happy
computer can anybody who uses it
half of the time the statues are of a naked person
he says that <percent> of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing
the faith that this struggle would them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times
i asked her how long i would be grounded
you could either agree or disagree but for this <caps> mostly a disagree
the title of worlds tallest building
surely the effects of computers cant be good
finally our turn so i got on and she was right being patient in line was worth the wait and it was so much funnier to get on
as she walked up to the door she heard noises and went inside to see what it was
click turn off your computers and get out of your chair
i try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times
removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere
this also adds a cozy feel to the environment
there are many times i was patient
the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident would have been
i could drop from a heatstroke
this last paragraph reveals something special to the reader
the features affect the cyclist
its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days
no book should ever be taken off the shelves
i am writing this essay to you to tell you
<caps> is writing about the wind
people these days use computers for pleasure
the author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored
also it tells you about your town
writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message
like i said laughter is the shortest distance between two people
my dad had to sell stuff of his all the time to help pay off all the dept
the world is changing everyday so we need to change our ideas with it
according to paragraph <num> it says the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
now you know all about a time in my life when i had to have patients
these are just very few things that can happen
if they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets
its a great tool to talk to your friends in your daily life
in conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best
my freshman year we read <organization> and <person>
thats why i think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries
he began to feel discouraged when he passed the grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
they usual are good listeners
the dirigibles ran on hydrogen which is flammable
in conclusion id say this would want to get up and get outside
we would also have less censorship for people who only try to spread there ideas
we all had a gut <caps> that this was going to be the best one yet
the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast
this is why i think the mood is so grateful and happy
like on paragraph <num>
it shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life
there was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas
the would need to make the frame stronger to with stand the stress which would cost over sixty thousand dollars
this should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library
no one should have the right to take that away
<person> made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize
that is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time
we can get just as much information out of books if we try our best
most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them
also laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting to close to a building
if people take out stuff that kids and teens like
the builders had to make over <money> worth of modifications
but if i have the right to remove the book i abhor
well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others
in paragraph <num> it says the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
and <caps> and <caps> are fine for any age group
there is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another
any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button
so it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it
for his family and the people <caps> him
also all he could do was a water depleting <num>
using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier but their is on even greater one
those are my reasons why computers are good
taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else
for example if someone likes rap but not country that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways
they would not be able to show off what they really like
they would ask me to laugh like <organization> <organization> so they can get a laugh also
the features of the setting affect the cyclists mood throughout the essay
i could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain
it can be the connection between people
a time when someone else i knew was patient was when i was trying to have sleepover with my friend <caps>
even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill
i got a big laugh out of that
computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much <organization> their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise
he for gets about everybody
these books should not be taken away from the library shelves
i would want to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor
the aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire
as the year progressed <location> and i constantly strove to out do each other
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
handeye coordination is very important
he wanted <caps> to go to the deep end of the pool but i was to afraid i would drown
so you should try to make people be on the computer less often
as people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong
not being so smart we figure <location> can just ride the dirt bike the three mils back to my house on main roads and he will be fine
my grandma and <caps> waiting for hours
if the empire state building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem
some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color
for not getting the the gamer
eventually i got my cake but i was sick of waiting for everything
then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open
that electricity comes from power plants
computers let you talk to family and friends around the world
also if your stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator
this i could not imagine
in the past few years
i think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends
she could take the dress home
we needed green cards to become <caps> <caps>
the setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of the weather is hot and dry and there are wild animals
there was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the empire state building
time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer
<caps> example some people like to talk with a family member the is not in the <location> so they communicate from the computer
the last reason is parents can limit what their children read
teacher said okay tomorrow
this is a happy setting where the author grew up in
it gave me a gigantic
movies rated above the <num> level are most of the time not held in libraries
and its not just for young people to fool around with friends but adults use social network too
i got very hot and i did not just want to sit their but i was patient
many features of the setting affect the cyclist
for homework said a teenager
they allow to talk to people thousands at miles away man instant
i kept watching until the end
this happened about <date> for the <time> memory
thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing
many record keeping systems are switching to computers now
<caps> knows his parents took chances and did whatever to keep him happy which sets this mood to be so warm and heart filling
this shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey
we went outside for a third time played
not only that but the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds
all of the different cultures came together in friendship
<person> and i started talking and hanging out a lot that night
i was dressed similar
a good form of education is the exposure to different types of material
the person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them
censorship of libraries would take away our rights
computers can also be addicting
but encounters a snake
not only that but we need computers for school
the first obstacle was the little room they had for a landing spot
she brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying
i was in a bad mood because my friend <caps> was mad at me for something that never happened
if i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato i would but i never go on the computer unless it is for homework
anything you need you can find it on the computer
i sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch
dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast another obstacle was the law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas
if it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf
this is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive
another reason i believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless
whenever we went to <caps> to go shopping wed use our accent and everywhere we went people would ask us where we were from
people also spend way too much time using computers
another problem they faced was the stability and support of the building
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by it being so hot outside that he could have had passed out and died
if people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it
there is bomb making websites and illegal music downloading websites
i tend to not read very many books about the world
to always look at the map
they are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others
the next person after me
i think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love
so its important for them to learn and watch for there kids
there are bigger more advanced computers that scientist use every day
the builders at the empire state building faced many obstacles but safety and reconstruction were just some of those problems
the freedom we have is a freedom of choice
about over <money> of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework
but to others its does nothing to them
nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such
these negative comments will get nowhere in life
movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship
children can play with there friends all around the world now without leaving there bedroom
luckily she said i only had a cold and an ear infection
she missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it
if there is an <caps> who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library
a third reason is that they <month> end up offending some people by removing a book
in the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself
from reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end
the only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling
far in the distance was a light
the builders of the empire state building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
every book removed from the shelves is another learning experience taken away
they always had each others backs and had many celebrations
another long wait to be patient at airport security
if you want to chat with your friend go to a place out
you never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you
this can be an advantage to someone that cant always get to classes
the hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store the geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter
many sports teams like the <caps> use this
i think these websites are great and can only improve society
you just got to know how to avoid it
so if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left
so i decided to stop
why kids are acting the way they are
not something they want to hear
then it was around noon and i was hungry
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
it takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected
no late fees and no waiting lists
if you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it
<caps> people are affected by this
is good to be in computer but not to long
the largest obstacle was
i believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was blooming and reminded her of home
and i said i tell you mommy it was coming to day
<caps> wonders the house frantically for dishes and putting them in the sink
the author constantly talks about how his home was a wonderful place and a happy environment to live in
the wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the air currents
statistically saying <num> out of <num> jobs in the state use a computer or technology relating to a computer hardware
computers can also provide entertainment for people
the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf
having a computer is mandatory for school
this shows how happy and thankful he has been throughout his life because he was given the chance to grow up in <location>
trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
inside there were pictures revealed that my mother was not to happy about my brother seeing
but now my parents have to consult me to leave the computer multiple times
the older sister is to busy looking for her own book
he needs to use more energy to get over the hills
some reasons for this are the very building itself
she thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year
another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health
people to <time> for freedom over much bigger issues than books
an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
a few days went by and soon it was <date> again
but i believe in both not to stop letting people reading them and for them to stay on market
i have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community loving place is to find peace and quiet
almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another
people have to learn to just limit their time
i have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight
the communists censored everything inside the <caps> <caps>
it would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything
also my sister to this day is still called lemons
the features of the setting in do not <caps> posted speed limit affected the cyclist
libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs
i ordered with my mom and dad and waited
this action can help with sports
if someone in their family live long distance then they could always use emails to talk
we got to the woods <num> or earlier
the first example that the mood created by the author in memoir was being grateful
<location> has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where i would like to go during the <date>
the narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding
if anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic
until my dad told me too
<organization> sees two rusted broke down cars that look like they have been there for centuries
at the end i was really worth it i thought
i have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids
the location of a cyclists ride affects the persons attitude and strength
hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people
the builders needed more support for the buildings framework
with its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret
that was the day i was patience
computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers
in the construction of the empire state building the <caps> faced plenty of problems before and after the making of the mast
the features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
maybe <caps> was my sense of wanting superiority as well
one reason why i think there should be censorship is because of minors that <month> want to see things that <month> not be suitable for them
thats why a computer is handy
that is the primary reason why i believe there should not be any censorship
it is just a matter of life
parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so
being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you
one of the <caps> reasons that this <caps> <caps> was due to the air laws that made it illegal to fly too low in urban areas
we decided to meet at my grandmas house
i think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning
the next big topic is <caps>
these people also have no time for their outdoor activities they used to enjoy
i think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to
when you are building a model you have to use patients so <caps> is right not having patients <caps> will be wrong
all you have to do is search what you want information on and millions of articles will be at the click of mouse
he mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story
and adapt to her new country
laughter is a <caps> action that personifies how similar members of the human race are
so i had to wait in the line again and take more pictures
why try to block out negative things when there all around you
different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups
we were there for an hour
this time i was relentless and determined to make a new friend
like it might be a comic book that my say something that someone my take offense to
i feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate
we can easily look up facts about anything on the computer
are there some relatives you been face to face with <caps> its because of computers
k and other fast food <num> go on the computer and eat
the author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it
it is an efficient way to study or find information for school
one case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school
it was a few more weeks later she was almost better so i was excited and went and bought her a gift
they can help contact friends and family from all over the world
so we where surprised
being addicted to the computer is too
the detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir
the kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence
in conclusion i think the computer makes the world that much easier
the surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence
they are <caps> so they can also help other refugees
in the end the <caps> of the empire state building could not overcome the obstacles
then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things
after a few minutes of talking she sent us off to <caps> our first scene
there was this atmosphere of love and thankfulness in his life and that is expressed in this memoir
most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want
i have a best friend named <person>
all knowledge would be taken away
also he had to keep dehydrate
it was as if our dreams had come true
building a <num> ft tall building was hard adding a mast would be even harder
some books in libraries offend others
these babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down
for someone to make negative lyrics about a person or something says something about the person who made that song
like a section for older kids and people
when <person> and i were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with
its time we put a timer on our computer and spend more time outside
you have to take time out to really listen and here what they are taking about
the tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation
well its going to be exposed sooner or later
that is what <location> has come down to computers
today you just have to go onto <caps> <caps> and type it out
the mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful
there were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast
so if you want to read a book with no censorship or if you want censorship then you can
censorship is the underlying problem to many things
<caps> <caps> was furious with the fact that no one was as fast as he was
it means that you are understanding and tolerant
the computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in <location> you can talk to somebody else in <location>
the setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally
<person> asked patience is waiting for something without complaining <caps> explained <person> <caps>
this is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better
<person> was one of the top picked books by high school students
are for entertainment
but i think that <caps> need to cut down on the use of electronics
you finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again
the answer is the customers at the library
sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it
everyone finds different things offensive
<caps> had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress
some books <month> be offensive in religious ways
most of it is very helpful information
either way there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive
these skills can also help us do more things at once
it just is not fair to everyone else
i felt my guard go up
at this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry
so obviously computers are environment friendly
what i was waiting for was the <caps> <date> for <caps> to start
in fourth grade girls are required to watch a video on the topic of puberty and in fifth grade many girls begin to go through these changes themselves
i believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people
first <person> was on the tube and i was flagging on the back of the <caps> runner with my brother
its there people want to read it
it shows he learned the most important lesson it this house
you never know the people could be messed on in the head
i had to wait in a long ling to get <caps> hair cut
on the computer you can also use programs to make graphs and tables to show data
its a good thing we brought our <caps> player so that would hold us off for about two hours
in all they should not band one book
it was time for the choir to come out and sing once more
for someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship
a perfect day to be at the fair
you can learn just about anything on the computer and its just so much fun
so our only option was the computer
i will be writing about a time my <caps> took a suit to a tailor for a conference
the new technology has caused people to loose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would them in life
i think i might have broken it i replied in between jobs they rushed to get an aid <caps> quickly a possible
i had to go to the <caps> <caps> to get it
<person> and i have become more acquainted and more open with things
she looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made
just imagine watching <caps> and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it
patience brings victory
laughter is the cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebodies pain
have friends from all different race and culture
the author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking
the challenges ranged from nature itself to laws against it
giggles turned into laughter and the laughter became hysterical
i would have to say no
lastly when you have a computer you can chat and talk to other people
i was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that i started crying right in front of my best friend
i came to a hard problem every once in a wile and i would stress out
it had to me my best memory of laughter
events in our life that we went through brought us together <caps> it was all finished and done
yoga is something to help take away stress inside of you
really all that kept him on the ground was him being patient
another way computers benefit society is by letting people chat with people all over the over world
but i just went with the flow and we went to the pack
it is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated
guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong winds
i myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for bad words
my mom was waiting for <caps> inside
thats what patient is to me
most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other
so many stores now allow you to purchase stock on me
it showed his small house and family and their interests and how they all acted together
the setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help
she told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names
the flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test
then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it
the lines was as long as having to <location> itself something told me it was going to be a long wait
computers do benefit are society
also he was thankful for the community he had
i support the advances of technology
both <person> and i looked up to see her stop coming up
i remember the look on our mothers face as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing
music i think is different
this <month> apply to everyone else that they are not accepting it
so i sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhorthen you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
it gives you this sense of a warm family
i never knew how important laughter would be to me
<person> teary eyes and wet face began to dry
that is what can happen when buying something off of the <caps>
my mom told it will only take two minutes
this quote shows that for one this dirigible would need to find a proper landing area
the workers then had to spend over <money> to remodel the framework of the empire state building
the authors parents risked so much for their son
one of the obstacles were the safety problems
what you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean
that get me to my next point
staring out at the fast flowing water and toss <caps> baited fishing line off shore
not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex
normally i would have to slave over books to find something
the possible dangers of having something fall on them
they are extremely dangerous for our health
as soon as we let go it was like being om the back of a two thousand pound animal in a rodeo the only lasts a second
her whole outfit screamed adorable
let this be a step in the right direction
i was patient for <date> <caps> <date> present
there are some good ones out there if u look
there were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety
many of these companies let us take these devices to allow as to do everyday things
when people try to censor things they normally just take things off of shelfs and get rid of them
the features of the setting directly affects the cyclist
something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it
the computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics
a mooring mast could just be put on top of the empire state building
it just on how you view it
as she continued on her rant she became more and more mad which made us laugh harder and harder
i was waiting for the contest to end
we were here in <location> waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck
its an important skill to have and to help you live your life well without it being crazy
cures for different disease like cancer can be found
he thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean
the author loves his parents and is very <caps> for all they have done including turning this simple house into a home
but then they also have uncensored items
addiction is a serious matter
you can also talk to the library manager and tell them the issue with the offensive it has given you
interacting with living people in person
that was the time i had to be patient
more people should be out exercising
i was very confused at why she would act this way
it was where i learned the real definition of family
the most common thing that we had in common was laughter
i think having a computer is good because you can research stuff and you can meet people and chat with them
its been about a year now
according to the excerpt this was neither practical nor safe
they also provide learning experiences with many resources at your finger tips
the setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way
computers take away peoples free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness
a lot of things can influence to the reader if they read a book that is offensive or if a kid sees a movie that involves violence
if a dirigible was to catch fire above a densely populated area there would be disaster
patience is when you can take your time at something
another obstacle was nature itself
another obstacle was the safety
i started to just eat it all
handeye coordination is not something you are born with
<person> left the group of girls one day at lunch to talk to me about what had happened
so thats my story on patients
<caps> makes it clear that the passage is written with gratitude
<caps> only i waited
they would have a happy healthy life
the obesity rate is higher than ever and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping
people talking each other on line is just another way how computers benefit society
we have a freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others
it tells us about the neighborhood he live in
the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame
if a fouryear old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated <caps> movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age
bullying has caused death or many other problems
if you disagree with the book or whatever it <month> be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it
if one needed directions to a place or if one wanted to know how to do something <caps> would show how to
and the only way to fix would be to spend over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to strengthen it
i believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books
those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist
i cried every night for three weeks
just like from the picture of the hibiscus flower next to the highway
some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library
then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again
what other people do to you or say about you can have a bad effect on them
my <caps> experience with computers is that they have <caps> much information but sometimes it can be too much
well for starters there is dimples in their cheeks and crows feet in the corner of their eyes
being able to contact people has never been easier
it took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger
her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and its strong enough to live through the winter
there are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends
the author was serious to the point where his family had to go through economic and personal problems
i want to help the world not hide from their pain but just to realize life can take a twisted turn and still end up being alright
the boy had just fallen to sleep
there are many ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir
those are the things i know about patience
it is pretty clear to me things need to change
ever since then they have had many hilarious and embarrassing stories that they can laugh at now
when you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive just put it back on the shelf and move on
first i read the book aloud it got both of their attention
i was told i was going to have two new sisters named <person> and <caps>
this goes for literary items too
sometimes when she came over she would bring all her make up and things so that we could dress each other up
an artists work is a part of who they are
they use them to much these for people can stop going to gyms and get over weight
without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have <caps>
<caps> is a little bit different with a <caps> <caps> student though
he decided to just give up
<caps> the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened
last year i had to sell my cow because she was sick
the only problem was that the next flight was at <num> and it would take i them two hours to get here
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
i believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around
you have to come see our new place
they let you explore the world in one click and chat with your friends
on the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression
and also the home bringing the family closer together
they turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go
many people might say we could all just write it out
i am hardly ever serious nor take things seriously
it is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days
this is how i was able to do so
but on <date> <time> <caps> mom pointed out that i seemed different
there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
the workers first obstacle was to make docking at the empire state building safe
i know i would become angry if that would happen to me
which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the u
it comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age
however there were many obstacles to overcome to allow this to happen
i would be two because sometimes a whole chapter could be bad or in music a whole lyric could be bad
the camp ground was only about <num> to <num> miles away
<caps> <caps> went and looked at the end of the line
we kept talking and before they all left they invited me <caps> go on there nature hike up on top of this mountain
there are many <caps> showing the mood <caps> on the article
i had informed <caps> mother about this system immediately
i started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when i saw a brown figure move
taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it
everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates
first off they can be dangerous
lastly a law prevented dirigibles from flying to low over a city
then in <location> next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason
it was because of me smiling and laughing that i made new friends and had another great high school life
i never really liked planes
the author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills
computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school
i was patient for a whole <date>
another obstacle were the winds at the top of the empire state building
my first paragraph <caps> about handeye coordination
it would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the buildings foundation
the final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude
her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive
but i guess thats just how they do things in <caps>
with more and more people using computers
the footsteps i listened for behind me suddenly came at a faster pace
that day when i was not good day turned out to be the best day of my life
many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way
this presented another problem
this also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test
so we waited played hangman and saws other <caps>
the builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast
my heart started beating of excitement
and to get good money to make us happy
well we can do something about that
everybody needs to socialize face to face
finally the law was a issue
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
every day <caps> i got home from school i would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours
this can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them
laughter is such a great joy in my life
<person> was hardly better
nature too became a problem in the futile attempt of the builders
it has help our world is <caps> many different ways too
i was so excited that <caps>
the effects that computers have on people is that some people cant stop using them even if they want
i would have learned nothing instead of learning how people lived in <location> history
this quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions
he says i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
well i think after reading this those extra <percent> will be persuaded
<caps> found out that <caps> was her parents
no matter where people go they can find something that could offend someone
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show <caps> strength and encouragement
this is a time when i was patient
then my patience showed up
a lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard
a very popular game is the <caps>
<person> had just entered behind me and by the sigh she let out i knew she had forgotten hers to
after all this time i finally knew
in the spring shows when the flower will come back
they also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently
many more things that are in good use
kid or if your an adult
another obstacle the builders faced were the winds on the top of the building
in my years of reading i have read a few books that were questionable
you cannot control what other people do or say
another mood could be guilt
yet parents lot the children on them
shes on like for <num> minutes to an hour
there are too many of these tales to pick out even one
the <caps> are coming back
my dad went into a patient roomwhen my dad <caps> out he said and he was healthy
there is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food
i believe that children are the easiest people to influence
the last problem was a law that prevented airships flying too low over urban areas
i still remember sitting in my math class when a tall boy with brownblond hair sat in the front row
there has been offensive things in a library for as long as i can remember
there was also the mixing of the aromas in the air coming from the kitchen
if people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs
this is what i think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves
the cyclist was exhausted as he was going up hill
more and more children are becoming obese by the year
the computer helps me find information for my science project faster than going to the library and looking up information on a book
the character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time
it was an older school with kids that mostly lived in lower income housing at the time
the whole <num> hours at this new school was dreadful
thats a lot of brain cells to lose when you are going to need them for your education
we walked out the front doors and we were on our way home
it kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it
children can be easily hurt
these are various programs
i got myself situated on the couch and <person> sat next to me
at the beginning of the <date> my brother and i were going fishing almost daily with our friends
it was a bright sunny day
instead of running over to the library and wasting your time with a book
the girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad
but when you find yourself at thirtythree your laughing while your husband is wrestling your five year old
in the town <organization> everybody mostly has computers
if they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back
one electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers
our world cant set aside time for such
when the author says how his parents cooking was passed on to him he cuts away from the article specifically to thank his parents
movies bring out imagination and stories where people can watch and follow along
stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans
after she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while
that made me feel better than before and then i started skate boarding every day from then
you can take a trip and see your family
after being patient it really pays off
one reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated
the author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast
my stomach was turning in circles round and round and i had the felling of a roller coaster about to take off really fast
it is not very funny to the person being teased
so we all know that trust is a huge deal between two people or maybe even more
well these are my opinions for having computers
thanks to reading i was able to explain to you this much and how supportive i am with these books
<caps> <person> decided to go out and ride his bike
another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information
thats why they have so much different sections and selections to choose from
his mood of this author is <caps> and detailed
we were in there for <caps>
the topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years
i was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game
this quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the cyclist have a harder time keeping speed
be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks <month> be hard for them to complete
modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars
you should have a section for children in libraries
the author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents
<caps> rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her
about an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about <num> for <caps> about <num> minutes later i was done watch <caps>
that was my uncles <date> day in <location>
also if the dirigibles did land there it would in violation of an existing law
and what he want to show how he was living with many people and he is a immigrate
nothing ask yourself that
the setting led to her deteriorating health
i think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day
<caps> stood as still and silent as a marble statue
i had to have patience for a lot of things
there were people around
the winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the computer device is one of the many devices used for communication
so many people abuse themselves staying on to long
you are what you eat is what i say
computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues
many other people believe that laughter is an important of any relationship
one time i did that and <caps> eyes felt weird after getting on the computer
books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading
if we had that right it would cause problems from many stand points if you think about it
it helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on
it all started when i was in <location>
reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fastpaced world
sometimes computers do help with handeye coordination
they are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic
one and only relationship i have ever had
then i had this amazing idea
one time when i was little i was not very patient
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
you have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood
this is another reason why computers are bad
the building was now 102 floors
faces red and gasping for air
we got in the lot and i knew for sure that i was going to have more patients
any time the little yellow people came into the movie we laughed because we both thought they were cute
that is why i think computers have a positive effect on people
then i went to bed again
every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry
parents could look out for what their children are trying to read
i busted up laughing and everyone at the table joined in
we finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip
in my opinion laughter is an important part in your life
<person> and i told our mom what had happened
take this letter into consideration
there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
if you go back to the <num> there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that
most kids spend so much time on the computer and they to do their homework
you got to think about other people in this too
<caps> i started to panic
i can relate to this story because it reminds me of my family
as you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting
at one point in my life i felt confused and by myself
he also is happy about all the family he has
i was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied
everyone is different
if you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems
there are all kinds of books out there and no two books are the same
<caps> explains how it there were people of no relation who were considered family
that is the mood of the memoir throughout the whole passage
some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something
<person> looked over at me with another strange look on her face and began to laugh along with me
it is only offensive when we make it offensive
everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to
these are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and i hope you keep using them in our community
maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is
my sister was getting mad but i just sat there patiently
this helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job
used hydrogen instead of helium
after reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents
<caps> come down and talk to your grand parents
the cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature
these problems included added stress to the buildings frame
so the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist
we all at some point have seen or learned of naughty magazines like playboy
the hibiscus symbolizes all this
i do not know of any <organization> <organization> student that would want to read <person> the <caps> and give a speech about it in class
the memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them
ill tell it to you anyway though
if someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could effect their grades a lot
there were many obstacles that the empire state buildings owner faced
it seemed so unlikely that this task would be so fun
my grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name
it was a day like any other
and you want to talk to your friends
many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time
this allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities
the idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place
one way it is a stress is when <organization> and <person> moved to the united states and lived in a one bedroom apartment
then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina
you can email instead of using letters
so i started the truck once again and go to moving
<person> hates every thing about doing his homework
another <caps> in the story is sad
when the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere
i turned out to be a very small sun fish
then his picture was done we looked at it and we all laughed
what i think the cities that have a bigger population should consist of two libraries side buy side
when she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time
i think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored
i will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version
all you need is a support from your family
i feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others
i yell waiting for my dog to <caps> running and he does
personally that is what a library should be like to me
after watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill
the phone is not always an option
i wanted to say something but was afraid of their reactions
i think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves
<caps> <date> was a very interesting <date> that was full of laughter and joy
this technology can help you more than it can hurt you
but books from before this practice began to happen <month> be found more offensive then books today
laughing can bring people together
that is why i am here
the author is grateful that she has parents that moved to <location> for her
the dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast
this a story about a time when i was patient
and that the end of your world comes when you make it so
this would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus
this memoir describes how <organization> grew up and his meaning of family
let me tell you about a good time i had laughing so hard i even started crying
the rest of the day went on
people use <caps> messaging and its also a way getting connected to others
why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there
so many books would be lost if someone could write because it was offensive
this is because engines such as <organization> have of limits to with much information on the topic being
i was thinking that i was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below
i told him how i was going to talk to her <date> and there was nothing that was going to stop me
the next day you get your paper back and theres a a stamped right across it
every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family
the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well
computers helped people learn things besides racial ways in the past but also about there own culture
many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better
the author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood
the obstacles the <caps> of the empire state building faced was a law that was against airships flying low over urban areas
her clear skin has a tint of olive green
when <person> first walked into my room my first thought there was no way we would get along
though my opinion will only count to myself i hope you will to stress the importance of computers in your future articles
but thats only half of it
even the covers of some <caps> should be removed for the good of the public
<person> would then say something and laugh but i could never hear what he would say
censorship covers an entire multi media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship
he stand all my ways went away
the parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading
<num> out of <num> people work out home
parents on the other hand also help out their children and they also talk to their relatives or these looking for a new home or job
the mood in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness
when that is not true do to the fact that computers have
i take after my mom in this area
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful
my first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them
i will just turn it off or not read it anymore
he says with any luck id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth
this meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device
this quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents
his main problem is the lack of water
it is important to be aware of what is going on around you
it cost more than <money> to modify the framework
there was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water
if i had a problem with the restriction levels at the library i just would stop going
everything was going great
every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes
some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills
out of nowhere <person> little nephew starts dancing and laughing while doing it
that <date> we would hang out at each others houses and go places together
another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area
every single person has the right to be heard
so the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope
libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library
we need to let people express how they feel
many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred
but why do some people think that it is hurting our society
you can go in the computer in <location> and the you see the pieces of your car
so if i want something to look back and laugh on i had bettered to what i consider my part and making this planet a shared and healthy planet
computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
firstly there was a law in place which restricted airships from flying too low over urban areas as explained in paragraph <num>
i hope you can see why we need computers
then <caps> kissed me again
my opinion is the everyone as their own idea of what can be offensive to them
months went by before i realized <person> and i were great friends
the computer are a help because it teaches handeye coordination
it benefits society for certain reasons it depends
i think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the benefits of laughter laughter has always been a major part of my life
with computers we can do homework with our friends without leaving our homes
students in high school <caps> to the <caps> after school with friends and get in to see rated <caps> movies <caps> parents
the mood that the <caps> created in the memoir is <caps>
although they were sad i also felt that they were happy
its not like they are watching anything bad
the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the main character the cyclist
it was nothing cool about it
a tarlike substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling
it was here where i learned the real definition of family
in removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece <caps> or even life long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself
<caps> has told me stories and showed me videos about that cat a million times before
the geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life
the builders of the empire state building obstacles can be described in the following ways
it helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano
some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions
<percent> out of that <percent> end up getting better grades
so its rely important to have handeye
well the weekend finally came and when i asked my dad was he ready to go he said no
a sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay
my <organization> was patient and it helped me learn faster
this shows that computers is important to have
the setting is very important in every story and can change everything
<percent> of large corporations find the <caps> and computer very useful
the mood set by the author is thankful
computers have led to many dangers
censorship is based on a opinion someone has
that is all they gave us
maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out
when the come back alive
i was funny cause its the other way around most of the time
the reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and <month> need it for something they are doing
when we came up to another road <caps> decided <caps> was going to turn around
the dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high
and here are just a few of them
then the teach comes back and he got her help
finally it makes you more social with people
i remember calling him one night and he woke up just to hear me tell him i quit the dance team
we were against who ever was lined up in front of us
however many problems occurred
this story makes me think of my dad because when things go wrong he can always make a joke or find the bright side of the story
i know that laughter made my relationship so much better
together we would laugh until tears were streaming from our eyes and we felt the need to go to the bathroom
computers can be very helpful when <caps> comes to student school work
there is multiple ways you have to be patient at gymnastics
<caps> last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends
overall the memoir <person> is a story full of love and should be told for generations to come
it was night time and all of a sudden wire from my braces popped out of place
i know that there is always something that pulls you back in
staring at a computer screen for a long amount of time will not keep you fit or in shape
you just might make a new friend along the way
he was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper
so that would mean where would be no books form people to look at
computers have become the glue to friendships
this shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking
laughter is one of the few bonds our family will hold forever
if there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives
if two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library
it strengthens the relationships you already have <person> it helps build new ones also
like how happy dose that makes that person that reads the books
laughter is something everyone needs in their life
so the next day she when i woke up i woke up to early
i constantly feel judged and awkward and this has allowed me to see the effects of absence of laughter
that is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs
it is their freedom to do whatever they want
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles
the other practical reason dirigibles could not more at the empire state building was an existing law against low flying air ships
the still frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure
with this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets
there are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning
half of the class period progressed and i was still very upset and unprepared to confront her
i know i wont let me kid read a book like that
there are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely
for rated <caps> movies they can have them in the library
i ended up doing all their work
that is to help you spell the words out correctly
another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind
my second reason who f think computers have terrible effect is because eye damage
i told myself over and over stiff upper lip
when three kids grow up together they find that they like each other better when they get along
within the next week we tried again
i instinctively closed the door after i was done
no book should be taken off a shelf for its content
so we kept telling her that we were going to get her a stripper for her <date>
i can connect to that because i used to be a <caps> user of the computer and my guardian would yell at me because of it
that was the greatest obstacle
and when he is older he will no that i was the whole time waiting for him to be born
just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework
censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the <caps> of <caps>
all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies
this indicates a happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents love and sacrifice helped pave the road to his future
every piece of art is judged and then criticized
yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself
<caps> would start yelling while everyone else just busted up laughing
some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else
the <caps> says how glade he is that his parents help him out a lot
the swimming hole was the place to be that <date>
you need to be patient when getting a job
because i have a choice if i want to watch it or not
these words show us how much of an impact his parents action had on him and how they helped him in life
the builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
as early as paragraph <num> the author writes
this would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and would be unsafe to passengers and pedestrians on the street below
last year on my birthday my uncle <caps> promised me a phone but i had to wait for him to get the money
my aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how i was the only guy attending the shower
there was a boy that wanted to go to gym so when he got there he had to chance
it should not be a big deal on what there about
knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me
overall the mood created by the author in the story is love
that is called being selfless
then i saw that <caps> from three of my classes
although i <caps> a good relationship with my <caps> the relationship with my <caps> has always been a silent and guarded one because we <caps> been unsuccessful in bringing humor to the relationship
the engineers and architects needed to make <num> dollars worth of repairs to strengthen the buildings frame work
this made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him
my second reason why i think that they are not spending too much time on computers is because you can do your homeworks their and <caps> can help you with <caps>
they also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment
my mom took my to the doctors office to see if i broke a rib
the empire state building is <num> feet tall which made for some problems
the crowd to get across was huge
the computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world
i had another math home work assignment due tomorrow and i was tired of math already
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
i thing that the <caps> should have all type of books in there because thats what a <caps> is for
so i hope you take my opinion in consideration
another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer
i then formed my own personal opinions on what i gathered from the books
we drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance
when he finally stopped we asked again
when it talks about a family being not only people that are bloodrelated to you i think of my friends and the people i can count on
then my sisters come running down
the last obstacle faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
she decided to retake the test
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends
waiting is not that hard just takes patience
there is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf
in conclusion this is how the mood creates the author
all of the things are not for just one particular age
for one jokes are a great thing fro laughter but it depends on the joke sometimes because some jokes are extremely funny <caps> some or <caps> plain horrible
make sure your green stays in your wallet
the answer is simple
all of us start jumping off and having a good old time
this quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head
everybody in the community acted like they were like they were blood related but in reality nobody was
many doctors say that computers cause the new depression
<caps> i have been waiting about <num> year to <num> months
he had people at his house for dinners
computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures
but we all move on right
one time i had to be patient at an airport
i was so proud of myself
it can also show us the lives about people from the past
my point is that there is a whole world outside of we only got off our computers and played outside
we stayed in <location> for a week
alcohol is the same way
i got the phone call when i was at <caps> best friend <person> house
i really have never been patient
i urged to stay silent and patient and i managed to
that is not what the world should become but that is what is society is creating
<person> also explains about his community and the diversity there
the final problem he faces is the <caps>
we heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark
i do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves
another negative outcome is that they start becoming more and more distant from their loved ones
a thing that helps these parents are restrictions on the stuff that you are able to get your hands on
having fun puts you in a good mood
that is why is bad to use a computer a lot i hope u understand
i know someone that was patient
lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference
home and family is the <caps> one thing all of us love
most of someones life can be saved to the computer
it took a long time to get it but we won
it was about noon <organization> the sun was hot
another big target for censorship in some countries is the <caps>
another feature has it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it
she was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient
there was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the empire state building
the computers bring people together
i exhaled a heavy sigh
she though of how strange it was
overall i think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive
well many of us have
i was at a <organization> game
it can be very hard for somebody to be patient
you can have a job in the computer business
<caps> laughed and went back to his test
we do that until we both end upon the couch again
in paragraph <num> the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
the readers can learn from mistakes made in the past
even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely
<caps> need to think of what to say
computers can also entertain you
think about it your child could be out getting in trouble or be nice and safe at home playing on the computer
losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource
if they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with
censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech
the author makes the reader smile when reading about such a place
one problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
so this is my essay to you
it offers and contributes many ideas and actions
after reading do not exceed posted limit i have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things
i had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door
exercising and enjoying the outdoors is also a good time consuming activity to do
she is only eight years old
you <month> please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action
so he replied wed must be happy and to be healthy and to be with each other
it is vitally important that people stop using computers because before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends says <person> from i
i feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster
i started off by saying you go straight up here <caps> the my <caps> and the girls said honey you cant go straight up here
<person> got this crazy idea that if i spent the night at his house that i could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile
it is <caps> because they can give there child a better life
which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united
they also face structural problems in the building to be able to hold a dirigible
and it paid off in the end he found his water and survived
when we where about to leave my mom talk to the doctor and they took for ever
these types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life
if you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass
my eyes dance among the plethora of mismatched antiques and statues strung throughout the room easily filling every crevice
a time when i was patient i was patient on <caps>
some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults
we are too connected as a society
i grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head
they seemed to go the quickest because i enjoyed them so much
as more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair
sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people
it was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to
i got <caps> and even more pop
he just had to keep going
the <caps> states the house is a sign of life and love
the message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this
where i learned the real definition of family
with out family life would be much harder to deal with
no matter what a child or even teenager
another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a <num> ft
there are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist
censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually
i had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to to get <caps>
battling with the harsh winds would also be a problem
with just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home
the mood of the story was happiness
that is the family love i am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family
people are spending too much time on computers
i think you learn everything from your parent how to act and all that
a computer is just a simpler way to look up information
the mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood
the empire state building was to be the tallest building ever made
he is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go
there was an abandoned <organization>
another thing about laughter <caps> really makes me who i am to this day
after seeing that i thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me i would not of had to see that
now everyone knows i fell in love
the last difficulty that the builders had was laws
i think that there are many different few from many different people on books
the memoir is basically about family and how important family is
but jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed
that is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear
we will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do
parents should feel okay and worryfree when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the <caps>
<person> was even a little scared about <caps> was about <caps> happen
he is also thank full for his culture
so you go to your computer from there
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
that is why i agree with computers give you benefits
but laughter could always push you away from someone
libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change
the first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable
that there means that there is no way to from it
another thing is that when he ran out of water there was no snakes warmers just desert so he started to become very thirsty
then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up
libraries are out to make money thats all
like the basic theory of
the designers of the empire state building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on its peak
people slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace
the people who built the empire state building had many problems building it
computers distract people from their needs says <person> of <organization>
then everybody starts saying the foul language
one day i had to go to the doctors office to get shots
being patient is hard for some people but easy for others
as a small child i remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep
kids are living through computers and we can change them
your dad and i have been thinking and it is a big responsibility so <caps> next <date>
nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library
but that night while it was skating at skate port <num> got nothing
if he had a computer
one of these <caps> being the air currents at the top of the building
another obstacle was use of mooring mast was nature itself
every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing
it was really exciting and fun
if any dirigibles from outside the united states used to the mast it could be highly flammable due to using hydrogen rather helium
even if they are good or bad
let us allow our words to flow freely
since she is going to take the test again she wants to help her mother
if there was strong air currents the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked
the road has so many ruts
me and a few friends of mine <person> and <person> plan to <caps> there in <date>
plus the goodness in you just cant help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you
a cop car in my parents driveway
maybe that will give some education
i also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too
<caps> brings people together
thats the way you talk its because its your life story
there is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone
they more likely describe things
<caps> had to wait an entire half hour while <caps> talked and argued with his mother
but the good thing is you can customize you page so that wont happen
computer say <caps> there are available flights to your destination and how much
i was patient a few years ago with my brother <person>
<caps> is not honorable to take the life of a beast with <caps> back turned
even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person
they are hard and take a while
i think it was worth waiting for
limited computer use or parental control would really help prevent this
she must be determined in order to pass the test
not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth
i think that my coach is patient because there are <num> girls she is watching
also there are advantages to reading books that <month> show something different that that person <month> have experienced before
one way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books
the same goes with family
if a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials
the greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents
if the books are censored then i would have no sources to get information from
having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem
it took <num> minutes
she replied yes and left
they ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier
using computers is good for the body as well as the mind
you cant be in an relationship or have a friendship with someone and not share laughter with them
at the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents
<person> gave up and moved on to the swings instead
computers also teach handeye coordination
i cried for days and days
another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work
weigh down in the back with lead weights
homework had <caps> been more fun
once <caps> <caps> looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it
hes really not happy about listening to them and not following his map
some people work at home on computers
after all they are just words on a piece of paper
m went through after a brief entry on what to do if there is an emergency
you can also buy ice cream
videos are great when your bored
i laughed without a break from <organization> to <location> road
a book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention
laughing is a way of <caps> things go
that is when she took him out too
one is the stress on the building from the added mast
<caps> when i finally got out of line i stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer
the builders of the empire state building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast
we have the freedom of speech in the <location>
another obstacle was the existing law against lowflying airships in urban areas
the idea was eventually forgotten about due to the possible accidents that could happen
there are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby
one day i even heard a little <location> quoting lines from the <caps>
censorship in libraries should not be a big deal
it cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water
we have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
a library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes
the last thing we need in our society is fighting
i looked ahead there was a least two hours left for standing in line for the roller coaster
but she was the only friend i had for a little while <caps> i always give her a call every now <caps> then
in fact the are the best bet for a better future
thus computers are vital to as humans
my opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer
but luckily her sister was asleep
one event in particular from <caps> that week will always stay close to my heart
thats like taking away part of a persons originality
last year in <date> after school my dad and i went hunting for deer in <caps>
<caps> are you reading asked mom
<caps> is not the answer
<person> was walking and soul <person> angered
one of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to
you do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies
this quote is describing how bad the winds were and how it made it difficult for the builders to work
you can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go
as <caps> grew up many of his blood relations were not near where they lived but his neighbor were like his family
the greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself
with a groan i got up to unlock the door
censorship is not something to support
the author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer
<caps> will buy it when <caps> get enough money
another thing that makes people laugh are jokes
computers teach us many things
also no one is in sight
for adults it could be information on starting a business
i have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop
my dad was living to his work in the afternoon so i had an idle
so do you over your own child
i sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because i had never felt that type of feeling before
maybe she wants to see what lays ahead
math game science game different games you what
it was totally worth it
the people behind us were passing and we were getting honked at and not in the good way either
my mom got quite angry and my dad was also very upset with me because they knew i was much more capable than i showed in my grades
every year on <month> <num> my family become seasonal at a camp ground
with the computers in use people become less fit and healthy
i was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years
there were still to many people in front of me
the second reason is that not all people agree on censorship
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
censorship would in libraries would not be the most best thing anyone should do
the setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist
another reason is the safety of the people
an ironic twist as he calls it
i have a friend who is always on the computer
most dirigibles from outside of the <organization> used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable
finally we stopped laughing and got up to walk home
normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical
as i was sitting there all i felt was guilt and disappointment in myself
we will ask each other on this website
this is the moods created by the author in the memoir
think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored
some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kids our history
this <organization> was for teenagers and even some collage students
on the first day of work i walked in the the daycare nervous they sent me to the preschool classroom
more important things should be done during this time like studying or doing homework
movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor
i am most patient during tests
it means to be understanding and calm
kids that are interested in reading cant be looking for a book and pick up a <caps> novel with a nude lady on the cover
the first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to
so he ordered a program that teaches him how to speak <caps> while he is home
instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them
thats why so many kids to adults use it the computers so much
we headed out with five kids under the age of <num> so i knew we would be going on some smaller rides
we brought her video camera and put it on night vision and threw the watermelon of the bridge
lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions
my mom had my <caps> to cook <caps> on my first birthday
the <organization> serves many functions
i hate to go look at nature
surely this effect could be very serious
so the authors tone for his memoir is love and that he is grateful for everything with his parents
books should be something that each person should have a choice in
that is my story about the people i know and patience
so <caps> dad climbed in the <caps> and we told <organization> that <caps> dad was outside
we passed from the antiquated street to a dusky tunnellike entryway
incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work
a lot can happen when you are patient
there is a much easier solution that censoring those books
it takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it
it would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well
you can still talk and communicate with each other
laughter makes people happy and get along with each other
there i finally got to the front of the line to get my ticket i was so happy and that was a time when i was patient
one of the many times i went to the library i was looking for a book i had read before but i could not find it
books give people another way to learn new things
another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because hes pretty much dehydrated
anybody is entitled to his or her own preference
a world without books
at this time i was at a family members house <caps> <caps> dad said <person> was in a bad crush
much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay
then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down
what is offensive to me <month> not be to you
<person> was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said
one time i thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful
there was many different obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
this causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a short hit leading to no where
<caps> allows you to type up anything you want for school
another obstacle that the architects faced was danger
shes not on the computer for <num>
most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult
wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt
this obsessive <caps> time leaves no time to keep healthy active and fit
last all the hard <caps>
<person> and i laugh about almost everything
<person> told me i was doing great
i think that there is different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required
oh <caps> id given for that bottle to have been filled with <caps>
<caps> a recent pole in the <location> times
but you have very handwriting and you cant do it on paper you will have to use word or a writing program on <caps> computer
we decided to go on the <caps>
i lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line
people have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same
he was smiling and his legs were strong
if someone is offended by one of these things i do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements
which was <caps> easy task
over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view
directions are very important
then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars
but maybe people should cutback a little on <caps>
the libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive materials that they took from the shelves
my handeye coordination is becoming a lot better because i have types for a long time
arrived at the first town
this language is damaging how kids read and write
people these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad
the author concludes the story with the last paragraph
this actually means a situation that will came again that will help you to get what is needed out of it that you missed
i think computers are a great of technology because of the information they can provide
one of the first obstacles faced was competition
when my sister makes her mad she always regrets it
this is saying that you need to have a solid amount of support to hold a dirigible
this could not be done on the empire state building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly
he talked about the struggles they had but how they saw past them and realized that as long as they have each other thats all that matters
i was like and the van <num> and the car and <num> in the car
the authors main point is to thank their parents for everything they have done
but the car got towed away
the influences one encounters can be either positive or negative
most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports
then we watched some movies eventually we both fell asleep
he started to talk loud to me when teacher was explaining something to us and it got me into trouble for talking with him
they will get addicted to the computer
the semester went by really fast
there is more to the process like the <organization> people bring or take it to or away from you
the first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the buildings frame
a time when i was patient was when i waiting in the hospital one time when my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing
i was sitting next to my friend which helped a little
company all over world make different computers to bring out new styles so people can like them and <caps> them
i think computers are one of the greatest inventions ever
computers are amazing and society benefits from them by a lot
the contents of the books in libraries vary in many way
this lowers your ability to do <caps> on the test
i was so happy even though my sister and brother gotten what they wanted
overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework
later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on <person> face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result
in fact it made <location> and i laugh even more
i know i use the web to with almost every project i have
i soon found myself in the sick room after making a call to my parents to alert them of what had just happened
we all know that no family is like that
why take away what they like in not what you like
you can do things without a computer
the person who wants in banned should have to tell everyone why and stuff
the safety of docking blimps on the empire state building also became issue
so i went up stairs to read a book
when the said <caps> i waked into the room
and was unable to have a supporter to help
nothing unrated about that
also should be socializing with friend
the architects had trouble with putting the moor mast on top of the building
he was also feeling gratitude because his parents generosity helped him demonstrate how important family and friends are
there are very many view points of this topic
there are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way
with computers kids are rarely going outside
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
my pit bull was rubbing <caps> greasy head on my shoulder smearing more mud on to myself
the features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons
they solved this easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton
builders of the empire state building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
and this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you
while waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so
i thought that everyone forgot but i was wrong
the winds were constantly shifting due to air currents
that is how it is grateful
in paragraph <num> it explains how he is happy about his life
also it is used to make reports up for people
<person> should just walk away from it
we questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this
she got a <percent> we <month> also be able to see whats going on with the <location> and different place
use a computers <date> and your life will be changed for the better
the mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture
just think <organization> computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard
it is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place
this was the first step to finally moving on
also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in
instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves
this quote shows how cozy or warm their home is
for one you might forget what you learned
now i use email email every day
in the story it states my mother and father had come to this country with such courage
the music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and takes action in a certain way
the mood is set to a sad feeling
after the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games
when <person> gets out of the shower i hide the answer sheet
but just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity
its crucial to our health that we get active
you can always substitute other words in there for those or just skip over them like nothing happened
people are different in many ways
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
we wont be able to enjoy the nature around us
when it comes to censorship i believe that very few things should be removed
<caps> was being said here was that it would be unsafe for people if the dirigibles were going to dock near the empire state during violent air currents
we need knowledge to make the most out of it
to band all the materials you believe is inappropriate will leave the shelves empty
computers <caps> learning by let vast of information being available
in my own experience from reading the book i would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to
<caps> always made me feel so great
there are pros and cons to computers but manly cons
actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children
adults are the ones who see it and heard it all
they are good because you can learn things educational
the steel frame of the empire state building had to be strengthened because the dirigibles load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the buildings frame
<caps> stock the band aids a cross the cut on my leg and then gave me a lollipop
thats what i showed you in these two paragraphs
if all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done
where i would be today without laughter i truly have no idea
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
as soon as <caps> pole took off flying it started falling
<person> said come here and <person> put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton
allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building caused many obstacles
then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made
the fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love the you would have with a best friend
the association of <organization> reported that in <percent> of <organization> used a website and of them <percent> were in good positions
many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and i think that is bad
so if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon you can talk to them then
so please take the violence off the shelf
it was cold fall afternoon
next you should post this out on you news paper
and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others
the setting plays a large role in the story
hopefully now you have a better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is
the first problem they should have turned their attention to was the law against lowflying aircraft over urban areas
i think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section
technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world
all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
will you say i wish i used my computer or i wish i spent more time
and then these are the people who just like looking things up
nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of <caps> <caps> love oceans with pink sand
i think that because of many reasons and i will tell you some of these reasons
i think the mood that the author created was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have
people are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
it was here where i learned the real definition of family
parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds
i truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker
there was one day that seem particularly hard
he also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back
the mood created by the author is welcoming and warm
the first way he can get me to laugh is by tickling me
i only hope that you consider my ideas
libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well
then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water
computers are very troublesome
they know better than to start fights or cuss in school
but it is also one of the many distractions
then the warrior and <person> went to school
which means that i know they are very responsible and that is what i think patient is
they could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored
she hear when the hibiscus comes back brings new hopes to the life to take that test for
you never know what new technology could bring
the sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty
i would never forget this day when my sister and i had a water balloon fight
after chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me waiting to run again
over all reading books makes you smarter
my friend <person> was one of the captives of the computer
any place you want is at your
this has happens to many people but only one family in my family
each book in a library bears its own relation to each person that enters that library
she misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here
many lazy people like to put things on hold
patients is just waiting for my turn i should put it
starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge
the architects faced many obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality
thats why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone
the next place was also similar
our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival
my other reason to you why people use websites is for <caps> messaging
this quote shows that the authors mood is loving and grateful toward his parents because he mentions his gratefulness towards them
it took him a while but i just stood there and waited
also paragraph <num> states the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
they had to put in sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to its framework
it was such an expensive modification because they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the flat roof on the empire state building
art has had naked people in it for thousands of years
their is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally
there was nowhere to land the blimps
the mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents
the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them
well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy
that is why i think the author ended the story that way
i know thats the main word in my mind
they did for a while and then started again over a toy
computers save time and does a lot of work
so we managed to talk my uncle bobby into being a stripper and climbing out of a box and so he did and it ended up scaring my grandma
now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries
but the big reason <caps> is grateful is <caps> her family
they had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about
this place is called <caps> point
they made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence
if people stay on the computer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease
we should get rid of it
this tells us everyone in the neighborhood is nice
the beautiful things a <caps>
now i play my notes right thats to the lesson and <person> patience
even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in
each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy
some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say
the time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day
so the library makes a section for the adults and a section for the children
after i got cleaned up i realized how silly i had been
with them when ever i want to
but thats fine i can just take a nap
at school we use computers all the time
this is a story about a vampire named <caps> who goes to a regular middle school
even worse then the books we read
we were the last people in line
during the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions
one of them was in paragraph <num>
its not going to change
the people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked
when u go places there will alway be something that one wont like not everyone likes everything
this quote shows how much he loves them
one picture popped into my head
<person> mom pulled up at <caps> house and let him out
i want to live to laugh another day
one time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school
trying to work through traffic but we could not
thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about
one time when we were sitting in her room <caps> wanted to paint my nails and <caps> picked this ugly brownish gold color
computers help peoples every day lives and they could be helping yours
the next day went by and i could not wait until <caps> the next day
the girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out
this is my say on this topic
there was also an existing law against airships flying to low over open areas
the entire team of eighteen <caps> or so met up at <location> house about a week before districts
kids pick up some bad language from the books they read
secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes
i know even more than
since a library is public lots of people go in to get books
i said before laughing again
we started laughing at <caps> because <caps> eyes seemed to be stuck on only him
finally i finished making my tower it took a hour fixing
books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader
<caps> i started laughing
i got up and i walked away
we got barely any work done
there are other ways to solve this problem
when i first meet her was in math class where she had an assigned seat next to me
this happened almost every day for us
this law clearly would prohibit and make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
if the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects
we all took a brake and went and got some hot chocolate
i found it very interesting and educational
we started to get lots of food and it looked really good
being bad a video games is funny to me and it make me laugh
some <caps> like offensive things that they have in the library
people might think it <month> be better to take the bad and offensive item off the shelf
i think what you should do its not get rid off computers
i sprinted up to the front door and rang the door bell a hundred times
<person> was the first to lose
soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon
we left around <num> thinking we would be home by about <num>
the author created a feeling of homeliness and peace
in conclusion when building the empire state building there was obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the web site listed above can really make you forget about reality
the game was one of the toughest we had the whole season
in the excerpt the mooring mast it shows that it was not easy making the dirigibles a safe docking station
i had the strange feeling that i have known her forever
that they had to sort out
he seemed unsure and a little nervous
the average person goes on the <caps> ten times a <date> just to get information
there have been many times in my life where i have laughed so hard that i cried
first when i was getting a cat scan i did not want to do it but we had to so i did it and was very patient
there are a lot of people out there who like to read
one obstacle was the violent aircurrents
if you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives
let me compare this to a book
parents are advice and to be acknowledge what their kids are seeing
his chair and his box the only two things that he had in this world were gone
laughter is the best release
if i were an expert i would have nothing to worry about concerning computers
last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out
you can <caps> your job and talk to the people you need to talk to
i was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in <caps> room
this is because these games are so absorbing
its become a threat to its user
censorship is one of the most broken laws in <location>
how laughter can change your <caps> around
you can get things from food to cloths and toys
finally he started to talk to us
s dirigibles docking
then traffic came to a stand still
i know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch
but i do believe that you should be able to publish anything that you want over any topic
we got in line after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes
even after <num> dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished
i know that i would be overflowing with bliss if an aunt or uncle contacted me through <caps> or email
laughing can help you make friends too
and the only i could talk to them outside of school was on a computer
those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him
i say aloud to <caps> dad
material like that at the library can harm children brains by brainwashing them
they can not censor things just because some people find them offensive
now when <caps> tries out
it is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with
the building of the empire state building was a project which faced many obstacles
the sun was just coming up as i got into my box blind
until i finally got my food and ate
someone once said laughter was the best medicine
i believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive
computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands
everyone would waiting be first
so now knowing always be patient no matter <caps> the deal is
computers are great thing but they should not for going outside with friends and playing baseball
i think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up
computers are used by billions and they a great way to learn stuff about are whole world and the things that are on it
again i thought it was a bunch of bull
my momma went first and my sister was going next
another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information
lets say theres a woman sitting on her couch
this is how the mood was happy and made me thankful
they can help save the environment
those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers
now they are putting those same books in libraries
on a computer it will say if they have any or not you would need to <caps> tickets would have the exact same thing
a confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin
if your patient and keep working hard sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player
five more minutes i metered after about fifteen more steps from the alarm clock
the real <caps> of family through this kids eyes
the empire state building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spires on top
all i have to say is that watch what your kids read
<person> got out of the car and walked inside the castle
this law makes docking at the empire state building illegal the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there
i looked at the picture laughed and smiled i liked it
we could always rely on <caps> for an unrelated metaphor
now is the time to get up from your computer
i did not know <caps> was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little playground my grandma has in the backyard
after the <date> minute was done and horned went off and every one cheered again and lifted me up
folder laundry and watched television
computers benefit us by easy aces to info
all of these reasons prove to be a positive reason to use the computer
<person> states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of
instead of <date> we thought we could pick him up on <date>
everything in details
our relationship is mainly based on laughter
smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of worlds tallest building
if people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life
there has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that i cried tremendously hard
half of my moms boyfriends were from these sites
once <person> got up on the <caps> runner i hopped on the the tube and i told my brother i was ready
all of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored
today was a <date> and <person> and her mom was watching videos of her mom when she was young
or maybe when i laugh and i hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle
the features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay
she feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home
i started laughing hysterically
the mood displayed by the author was a warm cozy feeling that felt like home
<time> is just an example of how smiling and laughter was a big part of <person> and i in our relationship
my way of that is me at a doctors office and waiting for <num> hours to get a brace for my friend of wrist
never again will work be so difficult
after the long day of flying and touring places around downtown <location> we finally were at the hotel checking in
and the growing realization that i would die of heatstroke
a year has gone by and we are still friends
every day i have this kid sit by me on the bus
all i did watch trees after my battery end on my <organization>
well it all started with the day he came to the airport
his first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date
they let almost <num> people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first
there are books about every single subject in the world
the quote <caps> how the author thinks of the different cultures uniting together
will that said they use computers anyone to say that computers are bad the that you love do while this
the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas
they should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer
to create memories do the basic thing and laugh with family
those are the obstacles contractors faced during the construction of the empire state building
that could easily start a fire with the wind
i feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books
i can assume that everyone agrees with me that computers are an important part <organization> everyday life
this is not safe in any way
after you hear this you might want agree with computers have a positive effect
the single thing that i believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room
society was different then
because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage
i strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them
so parents can pick what they can read
as well as time and safety
theres offensive material in real life and <caps> not being removed
i will not be happy if the test changes to <date>
kids are more worried about <caps> or <caps> or even trying to slay a dragon than spending time with their family
laughter is much more than an emotion
this law should be all the reason for someone not to ban something for what it says
after lunch we went to our next two classes and the classes seemed to go by really slow
one <caps> <person> and i were taking a stroll downtown
everyone i hangout with is not in to freaky novels
social networks like <caps> allow your to keep your friends posted on what you are doing
she buys the flower because she failed the drivers test
in all the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building was a failure
i would like to be a patient person
the poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said
then the stress would be transmitted down to the foundation of the building
if the balloon wont stay still while unloading it is very unsafe
everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next
my <caps> year of high school started off less favorable than most
my hold opinion on computers is
they <month> start to talk and become good friends
using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable
the dirigible could be weighted down in the back with a lead weight
<caps> <caps> and <caps> mom were both getting irritated i kept waiting and staying positive
<caps> is because children that read it could join in on what the book is suggesting
both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home
therefore they are held accountable for their actions
which makes it quite pointless to have even built it in the first place
the latest gossip can be found in many magazines
being in that situation and setting i would have given up
if dirigibles were able to reach the building something could go wrong
i strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society
i believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side
the day was not a fun one
she hollered back up the stairs
almost all means of communication can be done with a computer
finally every one hoped in the van and <caps> drove
the author focuses his writing on the many positive actions and characteristics of his parents during his childhood
computers also help your imagination
at this age middle schoolers and highschoolers should be focused on their grades and their
i just went back to sleep
without any knowledge of the language and culture
now was the time to think of something to do
there will always be certain books that some of us find offensive
every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to
i took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off
my friends were all i had known through my years in elementary school and i was no where near ready to say goodbye to them
maybe i should change <caps> face looking with smiling and some confidence on it
they wanted to transform new <caps> transportation
laughter is a sign of good relationships
obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today
so he had to be really hot
after we were done the waiter came by and replaced our plates with the tab
far from the reach where kids and children are able to access
yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to <caps> or visit in person
he is happy that said times were so great
anyway lets get back on track
one obstacle was that it would add stress to the buildings frame
my will is stronger than my need
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
my body heat escaping rapidly like sand in the winds
where there are chat rooms were they can interact with others
if the whole community disagree with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it
here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home
it only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs
if others spent at least a half an hour being outside to <caps> some fresh air instead of using a computer most of them would feel a lot better
we became great friends <caps> the principal thought so too <caps> he went ahead <caps> gave us classes together
another reason was the wind
she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story
there are different ways of skating people have there ways of skating
until i found a job at a ice cream factory
i could make that he said
he talks about his family and when he was a boy and were he grew up
<caps> and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super <person> bros for super <organization>
what he was trying to explain was your home is what you make of it
you can talk to your <caps> all
it was a perfect doe
you all know how old people are they walk slow and talk to much
laughter has a purpose and will never disappear
my first reason is because computers are not safe
these are my strong opinions on what we should do with todays society
to find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue
i love to read and listen to all of them
you can actually enjoy life and have a good time
so the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license
that is another feature that will affect him
sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when i am hurt
it was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds
when the builders of the empire state building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many <caps>
they could even have stuff that the young minds should not read
freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in <location>
she states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again
architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up
either way your learning
therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries
i remember a girl in the eighth grade told everyone that i was a garden tool and that i would do anything for a piece of change
i think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change
so the author of this article really shows how just the whole town had a sense of togetherness with the family
awarded by the president <person>
they were written with this language because <caps> the way people talked back then
laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness
like he does it never does happen
in the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the empire state building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise
it also can help children with school homework
well the person she sat by moved away
people stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons
this is a good thing because then no one will get and everyone will be happy
if you want to listen to a song download it in seconds and listen to your
we saw them waiting for us and <caps> waved enthusiastically
i firmly believe computers gives society many benefits and opportunities
a huge purpose of computers is to keep in touch
if something causes someone else harm we should not do it
i was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store
i think that other people could feel this way so thats why we need to limit the computer
the air currents from high above made the machine harder to operate near buildings
but computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun
also it could help you get a job
i remember the time i was patient with my parents
i reached into my pocket <caps> pulled out his sunglasses
the obstacles the builders of <organization> faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was solved
those are several examples of what builders of the empire state building had to face
intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you
i have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion
i could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street
thats why we embrace it in our house we like to acknowledge it to my younger siblings
the author is always saying about <num> miles or twenty miles up the road
i believe magazines are worse than any book
i have the morals and the mind to choose for myself <caps> is good or bad
each of his children had flown from the mainland to <location> in order to spend this special moment with him
we have learned many things from it
if this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt
the idea of a dirigible quietly disappeared
the mooring mast by <organization> is about the empire state building and the expectations that people had for it
we are also taking away books that <month> interest a child
i sat and wait <num> <time> past and <caps> was getting close to <num>
i think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it
it <month> teach handeye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy
it had also made the cyclist have less energy
we were never going to get on the boat
which in return gets me laughing
this hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building
go see what you can find
the mood created by the author in the memoir is emotional
while waiting i mopped the floor
some <caps> feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having
censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in todays society
they had many friends and were thankful
we had the pleasure of telling everyone in school about the dirty little details
get your stuff together and i will call you back with more info
the winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home
and some people get offended by some books or movies
he is talking about how he had such a good life in the house
computer give people the ability to learn about places faraway
computers also help me out with homework
what he had to be patient about though was getting <caps> into the deep water of the pool
i believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries
that sent all of us laughing
this shows the author is grateful for his parents endurance to come to <location>
going up and down hills and pedaling really hard
no matter how the builders built the empire state building they still face nature as an obstacle
if <caps> think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it
if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf
fun what the government is doing now
computers is destroying the social life millions of people
but i know that i was traumatized
you could be getting other tasks done
all these girls and i have became so close in the last <num> weeks that they are like family to me now
i believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored
i thought about how much humor this story would lose every time i retold it in the future
another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure
i vehemently believe that everyone should own this device
it does not bother you
it is best to just keep things the way they are free
we ran over there to greet them and to show them where we were sitting
i think this a very important skill
even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off
we went inside and i went right in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma was making hot chocolate for all of us
making it illegal to even approach the area where the building was
she said i needed parent consent before i was able to check it out
<caps> mom caught me off guard
another thing is <person> would always praise his parents throughout the whole story
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
laughing is something every person needs
we were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time
the amount of time put into gaming
offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it
i went downstairs with a couple blankets and tried to go to sleep when i saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there
there have been times in my life where i had to be patient
my views can vary when i am older and have children of my own someday
another one is how her parent cared about others so they help family and friends into they got back on their feet and how she does the same
i say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy
one important skill you need in the life is patience
i was thinking to myself that oh well i am young and i will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad
knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped
so that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books
in the process in doing so they <caps> many obstacles
so i can easily tell a true story about laughter from my life
if the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult
computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it
computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources
everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there
the same thing goes for friends
the music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment
thats why i believe computers have a really negative impact on society
science also benefits from computers
i think <person> saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
she was lazy and never wanted to exercise
but meeting new people can also be good
the first game we bowled a normal game
i think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world
those are all the reasons why i think computers are a good use
the features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist
over the years i always detested singing in front of people
they have been used as a gate way for an extensive world of reading and learning
if you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle
<caps> <caps> yelled <caps> i get a famous bowl and a <num> piece honey <caps> wings
so next time your reading or watching something that is offending you
now time to compare with your friends
first of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age
the workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction
all of these thing you have to be patient
once you gain all that weight it is very hard to get rid of it
that would lead to hundred of kids with on obesity problem
for others it could just be words
they know some citizens are against that content
i read this book <caps> a <caps> <caps> <caps> and <caps> is really sad
<num> minutes later a truck came around the traffic jam and started fixing the road
here comes <caps> walking up the front door which just happened to be where grandma and i were standing
<caps> also says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
in the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke
you can go to a different store for enjoyment
laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life
the a team coach demanded
who knows maybe somebody might be more patient than me i the world
i think that computers have a positive effect on people
removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library
the computer is surely a great invention
i think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn
i believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to
the third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas
it is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about
i think we should have more time outside
that is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive
some of them take awhile to explain to and i must use patience in order to help them
they can confront the situation about three child
finally the workers gave up after the project was postpone due to mainly safety reasons
last example is if you want to learn about your countries history and the leaders behind it then you would use the computer
would be much more difficult
i had moved to <location>
that trip to <location> <caps> taught me to be a more patient person
<caps> was my first year there
he or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fullyinformed paper
<caps> are ways that explain why this memoirs mood is a loving mood
honestly all media actually should have their own section
we got to them and my friend just kept walking
i went to his locker and he gave me a note so i read it
there would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in
also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer
loving place that holds so many memories
computers can effect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them
after we got off the phone i hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as i could
you never know who can stay by you with a full amount of trust between you two
so i waited until <date> and then asked my mom if we could go that <date>
this is just taking good books away from the students
in the memoir he has a very happy tone because is his proud and thankful
the music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents
i was so excited i just had to jump up and give a hug
computers are an excellent way of teaching handeye coordination
i have seen what happens when you take a book off the self
computers also teach you how to set you fingers on the home row for the keyboard
this one finally cut the lock after <num> min
this gave <caps> a sense of family even though his real family was very far away
one should not be ineligible to <caps> a book or magazine or watch a movie
there are also educational purposes for computers
computers are of many things for they you
its just easier to live with it
before checking the material out skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child
it is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone
the number 1 obstacle builders faced was nature itself
i want to learn knowledge about myself and where i come from
so you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones
this needs to <caps> cant even have a little of time with his children
computers are a optional thing for people to use in their own time required to do
authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public
thank you for reading this and have a nice day
<percent> of peoples relatives live out of their state
in my opinion i think that computers have a good affect on people
<caps> also sets that mood when <caps> describes her traditional home
when on the computer <caps> kids will eat
this can improve our travel
yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment
the conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights
one day someone came over and they started talking outside
they need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer
if this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing
this idea of doing this was neither practical nor safe because all this things would be dang ling high above pedestrians on the street
also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands
my older sister <person> friend <person> was spending the week with us because she had moved away over the <date> and decided she would come visit
nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home
do we have to go through this every day
my parents whet to a party of there own and we were staying at home all night by ourselves
computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another
he thought that he was going to die
it turns out that we where going to a island on lake <location> called <location> island
but now their could be a lot more depress
our eyes started watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class
generations <month> never even hear of the <caps> of <person> just because it uses racial terms
you are just one step closer to death
com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds
that was another example of how this author was happy about his life
without this right no one would be able to express their views
to combat this captains would have to use lead counterweights
i looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill
another thing that has been a problem is magazines
an example is a young child <month> think that the word stupid is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word
but if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it
still almost pitch black
my brother went first
not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around
that is why i think you should keep computers and not exercise as much
this is no love story but he making me laugh broke the wall i had put up because i was shy and very uncomfortable
all the teams sat down on the mat
the materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them
but a lot of people use computers almost everyday
my brothers and i got along but were never really close to one another
i love my dog but that was the time i had to be patient
this was a day when i was patient
<caps> was the least patient of us all
there are websites that have math games and school related things
being patient is like a jungle cat hunting its prey
those people do not have to read books that they find offensive
<person> turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked
after he did that my step mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away and how we are back to normal
the bright white computer screen filled with all those emails can really affect your vision
i had piles of cards
he said as he pulled into the parking lot
but at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life
new modifications were only used to support the blimp itself and not other factors like nature winds
she uses this plant as a tool for comfort to help her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher
there was a mood created by the author in <caps> memoir
also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest
there are much worse things on television
my mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park
as i glanced around the locker room it was easy to observe that everyone one of my teammates was anxious
in this memoir the mood created the setting
for some people being patient is extremely hard
all of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take
they checked what was bothering me and it was nothing
after first half we scored <num> goals so we won <num> to <num>
she was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream
censorship is a big conflict in many libraries
another reason computers <month> not benefit society is because of the dangers of them
it can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant
sometimes i sit and think back to the beginning of the year
when you censor movies and music your also censoring out their ideas
i replied offering her the book in my hands
we lost contact after i had found out he liked my cousin though
a lot of people these days are using
it can be found nearly anywhere
next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold
but my dad want he was worried and then fill sleep
and it can make people have fun which will make them stay on the computer for a long period of time
thats my opinion whats yours
the changing winds would be torture on the back of the ship
i remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother
my mom said thank you for being patient i was you welcome i said thank you for buying it
the cops started to ask me questions that were personal
he was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake
statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong
<person> is one of my personal favorite comedians
while we were in there waiting for our coffee we passed the time by making faces through the nearby window at people who happened to drive by
i nodded my head with a smile so big with looked like my lips were about to fall off
you can keep in touch
these emotions came out in the writing
having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings
swimming is a lot of fun
<caps> is a tool that <caps> of our nations used
the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast
the story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings
but she continued to slide
we discussed and decide its not getting any smaller and go on the ride
my parents worked until the <time> and there was <caps> one to drive me there
we finally finished our food
i think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books
my third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time
they needed to make more than sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications
kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions
so you could get rewarded if your just patient
just like my friends and i
for example they show things about <caps> mythology for making a <caps> pat
some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind
such as i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
i believe that computers have good effects on people
so it just shows you that people are different because they thank things different then other people do
so i believe that books are more reliable
but if you can just go on your computer and talk to them theres going to be no charge
the word definition of allegory is a story within a story
in the story it says i will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home
so one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her
traveling is also a good way to get outside
i woke up to go to <location>
also you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away
the obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project
the employee pointed her towards the flower
some of these stories can get very graphic as to convey the point that war is not all fine and dandy and all it seems cracked up to be
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
well thats my theory i hope all of you listen to my advice <caps> up shut the computer of and <caps> <caps>
several times the author tries to show appreciation
yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch
just thinking about <caps> i first knew i loved him makes me laugh
this essay <month> make no difference but it has said what needed to be said and thus served its purpose
but you as parents should control what your kids are reading
i feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries
this is how the setting changed
i think most people would agree <caps> i say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same
and that is just too bad
any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way
the last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas
so <time> only <time> people had gone
it was my first year of <caps>
<caps> forgets that <caps> has one of his own
to have fun for example <caps>
on the other hand there is an extent the children need to learn also
he was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him
listening to the nonstop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject and every thought possible
you can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
by the time <caps> were done the clock hit <num>
show cool thing you have that are new
you could wait for him to finish
another important problem was the intense winds that were harsh and made it very hard to dock on the building
when the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again
the author created this mood by telling the reader how grateful she was to her parents for their love and sacrifice
middle school was a whole new experience
if the parents wont then try to talk to them and tell them about it help them understand
this is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff
they were all each other had anything not matter where they came from
so she would wait until she felt at home and comfortable again to retake the test
he said that he was grateful for that
if someone that likes those kind of books and they are being taken off
strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings
the library should not have the right to take inspiration away from the readers hand
the purpose in which the top of the building was created could not be used because it was to dangerous
<num> a few weeks later
and thats all i have to say about that
i was glad when everything was over
it was mom in a small town of <person>
the stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework
the next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other
even though this <month> be true there are other way you can do this
the author creates many different moods throughout the memoir
it broke that barrier and allowed us to open up
after the <caps> went up we started driving but another train was coming
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building
we love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true
its because it means so much to them
<person> went inside to ask how much time was left on the oven
it is called <organization> tools
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
computers occupy a lot of peoples time which could be used for other matters
laughing with her always makes my day
but they must come to understand that those same books help people tremendously
another obstacle was for the dirigibles to be tested in the testing of the mast
right as i got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster
who ever moved out of line lost
i said just <caps> excited <caps> they were
even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer
this will let you see the persons face are talking to
i was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile
the features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of nowhere with no water or direction
our pigs turned out to be great dogs
my team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them
so i immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think
like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is
this is just one example of how social networks are helpful
he also says his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family
whatever we fought about we would drag on for hours
in <location> today many young <caps> get raped
i think the best part of any computer is your freeness while on one
when you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot
there is a thing called <caps> or <organization>
and those are some of my reason why the author added mood to this memoir
this brings me to my conclusion
i was petrified and to be honest actually laughing insanely hard
sweat pants <caps> baggy tshirts
other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off
so our second game around and we all decided to change the rules up a little bit
<person> can make a joke out of any occasion
we now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well
we should be able to read what ever we want
i read an article on <caps> about <person> stated that <caps> users are most likely to succeed in school
we no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares
<caps> if they actually took this up with higher authorities
we must take a stand and alter statistics for the better
at the top of the empire state building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
this lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily
computer help society learn about all this
this gives you a feeling of the home being warm comfortable and most of all alive
it was too risky to invest on such an unsure project
people need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport
the mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic
one <time> in particular was especially funny
so take movies for example
things were great until they left
these are the <caps> the builders of the empire state building faced
for someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong everyone has their own opinions and rights
but there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way
the computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far off country
when allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles
computers are a key part in society and we depend on them without them we would all be lost
she will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do
it is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read
one obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building
babies will learn to type instead of talking or walking
what <month> seem offensive to one person <month> not seem offensive to another
i started laughing because i thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back pack
an anonymous source claims that they use their computer to contact old friends
for this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself
so what do you think about them now
even for the books that are unrealistic they are also made for a reason and should be allowed to have their place in the library
today was thanks giving
not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions
not one person has the same morals or values as another
your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways
that is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love
the author of the winter hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and <caps>
still smiling hugely <person> leans over to me and gave me a perfect kiss
you can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad
finally they gave us our food and this time we got the store we ordered
some you could save important from your past
he learned a family was a unity of people that helped each other
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
a good skill to learn is being patient
you can also learn either interesting and useful things like food recipes the contents in paints
i think i have an idea <caps> <person> as we walk away from his house
computer are a of looking in many different take days
there were many times when i was patience
we were trying to find the best costumes for a <caps> party
i agree with this statement wholeheartedly
that is why the author concluded with this paragraph
we giggle at everything
i am getting a <caps> from my dad for my birthday
i was really impressed
in this paragraph i am going to explain to you why i think interacting with family and friends is better than on the computer
everyone is different in their own way
from my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline
there will always be at least <num> person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike
one problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough
new read on for reason
not too long after i moved i got reconnected with some old friends of mine that i have known since the second grade when i lived here before
<caps> playing on computers is one of the worst things that they can do with their time
the law states aircraft flying low to urban areas is <caps>
but i just sat there on a bench quickly
no matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication
there are many painters in our history that painted naked womans many people find that offensive
the features of the setting affected the cyclist
the monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds
society is losing its communication skills
the use of computers is great for everyone
the author really emphasizes how thankful he is that his parents did this for him
now <caps> is always talking about how he is not afraid of anything and that he is so brave
so i hope you will listen and also agree with me i think i made my point about how much you should use computers
the author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme
<caps> one reason why i believe that should stay on the shelves
my mom said she would name her <person>
these are the fantastic things you can do on the computer to have a better relationship
but i always remember it has to end sometime
laughter has played a huge role in my life and has created some of the best memories
sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship
its almost like isolation from the world
my arms and leg which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead lightened considerably
<num> problems a day was hard for a fourth grader
she just <month> knew what this hunt was going to take
you can also make graphs on the computer
so i emailed him and how i get a response and i fixed my laptop
<caps> i thought it was absolutely hilarious that he thought i meant joints
one more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably
while traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert
maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your home work
a mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling
these are the reasons why the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building
the load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation
we actually made an appointment
another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth
books materials like these make a difference in someone life other than you
this is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood
they had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of the high winds it was going to get
when it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe
i started to read a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went in those seats
another obstacle that the builders faced was the level of safety
patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it
i would have been scared if i were <person>
first it was illegal to have an aircraft flying too close to a city was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
the building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars worth of framework strengthening was made
that night was the best for <person>
the cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination
<caps> was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat
my opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer
adults do not need censorship
this was also <organization> first time being involved with <organization> and raising a pig
the wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents
there are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library
if the empire state building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it
computers are a most have in a society
the computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history
these ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away
talking i ask my mom is i can go for my bike
patience had payed off
what i think kids should watch or read are <caps> movies and books
the tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death
also you can talk to them even if their in a different state
they use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time
at the end of the song we laughed so hard we cried
with computers communication is becoming faster and faster
the cyclist surrounds did have an affect
today in society there are many things people have different views on
these currents would cause docking to potentially be too timeconsuming and dangerous
but i tried to be as patient as i could
if they find something offensive about the material then they can just not look at
all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
taking out certain offensive learning materials <caps> leave people in a bored mindless state of mind
but thats not important right now
the author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then
which could be very bad if you think about it
within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together we were joking around and laughing at everything each other said
it also helps keep everything organized that way
but he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue
so thats my view on the censorship in libraries
<caps> smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood
the doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the <caps> look small
i felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are both in opposite directions the two are still having a great time
my name is <organization>
i can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time
i slept for a solid <time> hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus
you can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message
this creates areas of gray where there is no right answer
this is alarming because at that rate people <month> never get to know each other and the world <month> become an electronically based workspace
nature also proved to be an obstacle because winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
every <num> the line would scoot to a bit
we still interact with family and friends but know we are also able to do so on the computer
i waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room
she has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to take that test again
i recently waited to get to know a students better
a lot of us just laugh about calls that are made and just shake them off
i believe that laughter is a very important part in any relationship you have with any one you meet
life is too short to sit around all day
i took pictures of me and my mom being funny
that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home
once upon a time i was at the doctor and it was very crowned it
computers help in a positive way
he rode into the morning when would make him tired
i believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of offensive material
this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time
no i do not figure that
so i said thank you for being so patient
it has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way
especially if it is by their favorite artist
my second reason is that the more people be on computers the more blind they could get just for being on the computers for a hour or more
this world wold be nothing without computers
a good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride
a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature
the reader then might want to read her next piece of work
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it
we would always hangout
let us allow our legacy to live on
a lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs
so if there is not laughter in your relationship then obviously there will be no happiness
obviously the library allowed it there for some reason
safety was a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles at the <organization> dirigibles were highly flammable which could have caused a serious accident to occur
we started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen <caps>
we played it so much the first <date> that we just called it <caps> <caps> instead of <caps>
<percent> of the people who use computers are obese or overweight
computers have been rapidly changing too
my stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule
but me though if he wake up really early he would be the only one there
i would not have gotten that grade if i did not use the computer to do research
we <caps> sat down to <caps>
but after <caps> finished talking thanked <caps> for being patient and they all spent the weekend at <caps> house
the author did a great job fixing these into the story to make it flow very well
they could be offensive or not
i remember when i was patience
but this is just one of the many uses a computer has
people always have a choice
one more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
so i think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or who ever do
i was waiting for my doctor to come out
the best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have
i yell from the car window
two weeks ago i took my <num> year old niece <caps> to our local public library to find her a book
a time i was patient was when i had to be patient for having a difficult task without any hep
some parents might not know what their child is looking at in the library and wants them to be safer
it was just after <date> and <person> and i had just fixed our off and on relationship
thats how i was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done
people are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but theres nothing you can really do about it
if i <caps> too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs
it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
i treat people the way i want to be treated and that should go for everyone
<caps> a mother of the <organization>
<caps> looked up from the microscope and raised her hand
she felt alone and that she would die
so with that being said we both let go and let the water have us
when out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her
his was one time my friend had patience
well as soon as she started to laugh at me i stop and glared at her
libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they cant find at a video store
i have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf
most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest
the mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood
the weather and terrain had worn him down
anybody with a teen at home knows that
as you <month> know the author of this book is named <person>
then finally it was our turn to get on stage
the cyclist must have lost hope in <caps> civilization after he found <num> abandoned examples of civilization
one went high and the other went low
my mom had heard me run up the stairs and came to tell me the story of what was really going on
last few days before heading back plans were still going accordingly
you can learn about faraway places
the cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map
in school students are observed to see how well or if there coordination is being developed
in this modernized world computers are key
but there is also the choice of books for research
the author uses this paragraph to conclude to show shes going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings
in <caps> <caps> all the students in grade ten just got done reading <caps> of <caps> <caps>
<person> got a birds eye of the park
computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch
younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room
i turned on the light while <caps> and my brother were coming inside the room
neither of us stopped laughing until our sides ached and there were tears running down our faces
or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff
<person> understands how hard it was for his parents
which brings me to my next point
we tell each other whats going on in our families and all that good stuff
so i waited in line until it was my turn
all of us now how to laugh and all of us probably have laughed at least once in our entire lives
i am one of those people that believes that this quote has a ton of truth and meaning
its one step closer to world peace no more war or conflicts
the other largest obstacle was safety
this can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work
<caps> of my family also live far away
your old enough to be able to handle the content
i this because <caps> and family
my dad always says <caps> makes the world go round
this quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to <location>
you can feel her hope
we felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone
the greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the united states
the winds at the peak of the empire state building were violent
thousands of kids give out there address and have been robbed
so we decided it was time to <caps> some fun
i regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because i was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement
i remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait
i will never forget that day
he had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that really did look like a diamondback
we could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold
he barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him
the setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence
and it also makes you <caps> thinking of all the <caps> your family has to make for you
this means the building would have to be modified and strengthened
all the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me
she had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket both
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
there are so many social things to do on the computer and those are just some
the reason why my mom is patient is because when she goes to the beauty shop she calls <num> hours of waiting not a long time
computers have a negative effect on most people
i took <caps> opportunity to <caps> around at the expressions of my teammates
if the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances
that is why <caps> helps people learn a different language
you cant not make something that is making fun of another race or a movie of killing them
it is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer
most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable
it shows that the author had a very loving community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood
people learn much of what they know from the computer
kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this
because they know that they would never do anything to hurt them
many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students
critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities
although <caps> might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you
some <caps> do not believe that is an opinion
she thought it was just being blown out of proportion
i thought to myself <caps> we can do this
dear newspaper <caps> <caps> my name is <person> and i am a student that attends <organization>
thats why i think computers can be more helpful just depending on the way you use it and how much you use it
everywhere in the <caps> no matter where you are there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you
all of these are factors found in our books and music we have today
another obstacle was that the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
<caps> had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used
the last way the computer helps out the its with box from there
no one forces us to check out this book or that book
a last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas
<caps> to build a docking station the architects would have to transform the whole construction of the building
she knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted
it took her a lot to move to <location> but <caps> was glad <caps> did
they are websites on the computer
i can tell he is very proud of his parents because they gave up everything to come to <location> so their children could have better lives
we waited for a hour
i think that there should be an age policy for libraries
patient are people who been injured in same kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better
the day continued <caps> the everlasting laughter between my cousin and i
including the dangerous factor of nature
he was getting sad and dehydrated
<caps> i got up and went to the bathroom
that was only one mischief
the first thing was safety
first place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party store
it would be a very hard thing to get used to in todays society
there was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas
we barely made it to first hour
the modifications were very expensive
after we were all dressed <person> picked us all up and we headed to the dance looking fly
the winds would shift to constantly and violently and be to very difficult to control the dirigible
at first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had a smile on
the ride was amazing and deserved the wait
turns out we went into the wrong <caps> and there was a lot of animals in the place we went into
computers help prevent this in several way
there are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment
the games just suck you in and your stuck
his family realized that buying him that computer was of the best ideas
i said ill be patient till then and will not bug you about it
i honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age
those words are what fired us up to become an independent country
but the hills were sure to play with his mind
this is my second reason
the chances of people getting hurt or injured are more likely
it is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much
we stood behind a little fallen over log that was there for awhile
people really do need a person like my <caps> in their lives
computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports
the mood created by the author in this memoir is a very calm mood
without laughter life would never be the same for me
once they got out they looked so outraged and looked as if they were ready to call out mother nature to a fight
this would change the world for the better
my first reason <caps> i think computers have terrible effect on people is because its a waste of time
one day my friends and i went to a friends house and we started playing <caps> box we were laughing having an awesome time
the first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said
my mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dads decision
i was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me
i think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things
there were both at work and were not able to come and get me <caps> the day groaned on i became more and more anxious
my mind quickly recovered from <caps> slightly startled state and i stepped onto the bus
another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now
it has change the world
when asked <percent> of <num> graders say they use ebooks at least twice a week
i firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society
i believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material
he passes a closed juice factory
during the cyclists biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations
but none were as depressed as the <caps> that they had touched in their many years in ministry
he mentions the fact that his parents always helped friends and family in need and how selfless they were towards other people
hydrogen is highly flammable
she can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded
this system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive
this <caps> proves if the dirigibles blow the empire its not the only building in danger others around it too
hes thanking them for making their simple house into a loving home
one of the greatest reasons the mooring mast was destined to be unable to fulfill its purpose was because of safety concerns
since i use the computer everyday onto all
the last reason i believe <caps> have a positive affect on people is because it replace
as her carriage arrive <caps> stalked at the people before getting out
you get offended and complain
when i got home i felt like i was starving
aunt <person> was fixing the front of the wig for him
the mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family
i patiently sat there
it seems like he had a good childhood
for example the <organization> job
i then proceeded to tell her about a funny memory
computers in schools help to increase the amount <money> learning our children
when many students were filling up the tables i saved <person> a seat next to me
computers are used overwhelmingly more often
thats when we made our appearance in the office and there she was the chunky old lady that new me by heart
you are with your family but they are not your blood family
the large business district is too densely populated to allow such a thing
that time is when we repeat the same mistakes again
you never have that issue with computers
dear newspaper i strongly agree with experts on computers
<caps> there was an existing law against flying airships to low over urban areas
this makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be
the first problem was stability
she now realizing that she now by a whole new opportunity and life to start
i sat up to see his plastic sunglasses sat staring at me from my dresser
it could be interesting to someone else but not you
it also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine
using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving handeye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace
i tossed the ball up and let <caps> drop back down
that shows how much <caps> cares about her mother and father and how respectful <caps> is towards them
the author concludes with this sentence for emphasis
the conclusion sentences states that she is going to retake the test in the spring
known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature
you can search any topic and learn more about it
<caps> people every day are getting less and less active because of computers
i would see him during the <date> but not very often
now i would like to the time to talk about is mentally when you go to learn
her mind was also starting to ware
the modification to the buildings framework was worth over sixty thousand dollars
bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the <date> because people are not interested in nature anymore
hes taking all the day taking out his wallet and talking to much
another reason that he was proud is that he has loving parents that want him to be successful in life
computer have deprived everyone of the outside
he got his camera out and took some picture of me that are very embarrassing but make myself and others smile
the laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together
patience is an important thing
it was shaped like a snake
the easiest way of this was talking over
i had asked her if she wanted to go on a walk
even though these people think they are overused they still use them
for example email and <organization> is a way to communicate
when seeing the familiar plant
libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it
i gave him a puzzled expression then i followed his gaze to see what had aroused him
today was the final day of tryouts
computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather
computers do not help you brain they can make you fat and for a lot of people they cause drama
another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture
in <date> she cooked me some
students around the world for example <month> need to research information for a topic in class
believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books
and we just burst into more laughter
it was a two hour process and after the hundredth time you can see how i would get bored
should be censored to protect the younger generations
the library staff could put those books in the alternative section
the first place in the story when the <caps> creates a hard mood is when they say that racism is overt
the next obstacle they faced was nature itself
the next obstacle builders faced was public safety
every one is going to disagree about something in there life time
on the computer you can find almost any game you want to play
the cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers
a censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice
at the end of this memoir the boy said i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for
the worst part was they gave speeches
if you are doing a project on fashion a <caps> <caps> would be excellent to help them find out some tips
i went headfirst into the wall
your body need water to work right
high <caps> are filled with pregnant teens
but why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family
even a scientist can not know everything
for example i will never forget how my parents turned a house into a home
being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend
i believe the author created a great mood that reminds you of home and makes your heart smile
nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced
in order for this to happen the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be strengthened and modified
also the books and movies for adults are different than children books and movies
its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school
this means that builders had to work harder and figure out ways to get this to work
one day when i was out camping with my friend <person> i asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later
learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child
there could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph
laughter was the essential building block of our future relationship
patience is a very important virtue
i would always remember her sitting in a chair in front of the computer and filling out some papers
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
my sister pulled down my pants
this is just one <organization> many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people
yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of any human etc
they <month> live across the whole other side of the world
laughter is a moment of happiness
while at school one morning <person> came over to me and had a careful gaze
<person> when i mean almost i mean the only thing left in the boat was his feet <person> his hands which were holding on to the side rail
i understand that <caps> are wanting to read about famous <caps> and whats new with them
this tells how the narrator is thankful
there is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer
laughter is huge part of everyones life
artists write about what they love and how they feel
as i tried to swim to shore my shoe fell off and went down stream
which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem
thats why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer
for example <person> would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us
she was still too shaky to say at home she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up
it is kind and has no regrets
towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense
in conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist
computers are able to help them with this
now i was getting <caps> hopes up and expecting <caps> within <caps> weeks
we always have fun times with each other
throughout the story he mentions the lack of water
i thought i would be able to stay awake the whole way but i was marked impossible
i know i would not just for my kids but for other children also
the television shows are still being aired
i think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it
he even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water
people like accountants use computer for there job
i knew he would get it soon
the computers a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies
<caps> you are patient <caps> can get the book
my knees were covered in mud and so was my butt and legs
but computers see it a different way
this would create exhaustion
we would spend hours doing nothing but tricks and playing in the back yard
this hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next
you might need the computer to search up things for a project
she is setting a real goal for herself
i had a good conversation with my new friend
how it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house
so i did what any nine year old would do
thats when the phone rang
the biggest obstacle was nature itself
laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect
one problem was that the dirigibles load and the wind pressure on the buildings foundation
the last mood that their was was harsh and sacrifice
all of a sudden <caps> slipped and the ice cracked
the main reason i disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children
so have an adult section and a kids section
it is emotional because the care and love for each other
the greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
computers can put people who <month> not know any better at risks
she looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in <location>
going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy
magazines are meant to tell the truth and sometimes the truth is hard
you can either email them or talk to them from a web cam
optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it
<caps> mowed the lawn with excitement
when they left they went to <caps> but they were rich so they went to <caps> too
she had missed everything that had happened and as we went to fill her in <location> stopped us
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a stainless steel skeleton
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood
the necessity for censorship should never be an option
the author was speaking very proudly and happy about her parents
they were able to overcome this obstacle but many more loomed up ahead
that put us yet again in a foul mood
we would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am
its like telling everybody to be happy but without even talking to them
began slowly starting soon after <num> mints were the train ended
for these reasons computers are what benefits society most
like i said be what was <caps> friend
parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship
making adults laugh is not very easy because they are more serious
that seemed to be an interesting thing to me but not for others
while in the process of building the <organization> encountered many obstacles
computers teach handeye coordination
at the time <organization> was only five so when <caps> dad jumped out at him he got really scared
other people had their checkups and left and others just left without theirs
thats the story when i had patience
while my parents and grandparents were out in the front lawn with all the guest
this tells the people had to stay strong through hard times
everyone should get a large variety
we told him the story and he started laughing too
we decided to call my mom for a prank call
when we got to the car i had to put the bikes in the backseat
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
the idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective
<caps> friends and i laugh constantly
there are cliques in every school
they were not at my house
i remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive
there are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive
that way there would be no problems
the waiter came and told us our food would be out soon
this stress would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation
people spend hours on these websites talking to people and forget how to talk face to face
every winter our family gets together and goes to <organization> to stay in our cabin there
but once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the <num> of <date> to launch of our patience
its not fair to those who want to read it
you can find them in libraries nationwide
obesity is a problem in <location>
wait i also agree but spending time on your computer can actually be a good thing
such problems as these created many obstacles for the builders of the empire state building
when he does throw a fit she is very patient with him and works on it with him until he is done that is how my mom shows patience
if music or movies become a hazard then it should not be welcome in the library
which adds to his dehydration
not only is home a <caps> to be <caps> but a <caps> for family to be unified
the materials found offensive should not be removed
this shows he is thankful for all his parents did to make him the man he is today
those of the various moods set by the author in this memoir
to me it is the only thing that can keep me going
hell never forget the gracious neighborhood brought him memories and his parents turned this simple house into a home
whats being built all the problems became apparent
when our stomachs hurt from <caps> so hard
if we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of
being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend
<person> had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened
censorship in libraries i believe that there should be censorship in libraries
he weighs <num> pounds due to being on the computer all the time
sometimes computers take a lot of stress of you
being able to laugh with someone creates a bond with that person
my final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library
the author also writes
computers are a very important part of my life
when the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into several rusty pumps
the <caps> the workers had to go through were to much and the landing of the dirigibles never worked
its its not a real one
as if a person that was a cook might not find a book about athletics too appealing either
what <month> be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion <month> not be bad in others opinionated views
everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking
if someone finds it offensive then they can ask for that material to be put on the highest shelf their
in my opinion computers have a positive affect on people
he creates a mood of bliss through his loving and grateful tone
some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity
if you let <month> periods of time then <caps> will help you with hand eye coordination
one positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate
and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again
my <caps> started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road
computers greatly reduce that hassle
not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues but it is also a great way to contact people
the computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other
movies tell you what it is rated
they <month> not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have
i think that computers are becoming an issue
laughing makes you feel great
the laughing got louder as well as the farting
that is what i believe in
therefore i do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves
t <caps> that could be offensive to anyone particular
we always seem to find a way to make each other laugh
so find a friend and start laughing
by allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public
however within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get
he admits that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done
there all of the sudden it moving like a sloth
most of the time people have to do essays
the author concludes this story with hope in this sentence
within twenty minutes i could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway
you are probably using a computer to type the documents
these books are known as <caps> books
i closed my eyes in fear as she turned the corner
one of the problems they faced was that the did not have suitable landing area
she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people
so i went to wait in the park
i was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change
i now have to worry about what we check out
i said marco and he lunged at me
<person> went upstairs to ask <caps> mom if <caps> needed anything
if they used dirigibles on the empire state building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads
computers help us to learn in school and outside of it
someone has to find a way to fix things and in a good kind of way where people can find peace with themselves and others
as you can see <caps> jobs use the computer
not everyone is interested in the same book genre
because the author is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her
a dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about <num> minutes
too many lives are effect by <caps> media and literature
everybody has there own opinion on the matter
computers help reconnect with people
positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand
many websites also are adept at donating money while playing a game
i look over at the clock it was <num>
for me it helped me out a lot in life an it helped me save a relationship with my mom
computers have videos that show you how to play sports and enjoy them as much as you do in real life
i was having a blast
out of gas and you need to go to the library before it closes
keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental health
so we just waited and waited until we were there three quarters the way there
<caps> second reason why computers provide a good education is computers help you do your homework
well this is the end of my essay
they just think think my way is the right way and the only way
the features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat
above the empire state there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel
nature also caused problems with the mooring mast
another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain
well i am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what i think is best for younger children to be reading
he ended up loving the game very much
my last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage
were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality
i sit there waiting bored
this would to a book called <date> by <person>
she asked me whats wrong
in doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people
we make our students come involved in technology
this leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you
but and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical
you could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds
so people should just spend a part of their day on the computer
but even if they did dock the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast
revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed
the cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump
many things interest different people
we need to the of social without computer
that is how computers are good
being patient is difficult to do <caps> i did it before
people have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country
children are directly affected by computer use in family settings
please take them into consideration
also in paragraph <num> it states that the biggest obstacle was nature itself
that is what i believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is
at this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation
people that changed the world and other information
it got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated
if we continue this most people will lose eye sight
this story also gave a warm feeling by the story of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven
statistics show that <num> out of <num> people say tennis have actually made them more confident
the puppy was ecstatic to see my mother so she peed all over the linoleum floor
the rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome
computers help people with their job
so i went back to their room and told them to stop again
shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his parents had to make for him
his parents made his house feel warm and cozy
to us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but <person> decided to make a sitting chart
which are good for young children of age five through six
and that is the story of when i was patient
this includes your family members or relatives etc
there you here hundreds even thousands of entries about the <organization>
a friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling
lives of friends have been lost and friendships have been ruined
i was patient because i waited for a long time without doing anything
without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future
i giggled in the backseat of the car as we drove home together
although when i am upset i laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day
the first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to
the laughter and joy to my heart
so much information and so much faster
another way is a comedy
when a kids starts to hate his or her work
i am one of those people
there was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas
i was so <caps> that day
<caps> in conclusion <person> learned two lesson that day
the authors community was like a family
that is when i heard her scream
<caps> the first time she said that to me i went to the computer to see how other people were having to me
a library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books
say if two people found a book offensive an five people liked the book dose that mean that it should be removed
the children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular
this means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon
without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell
laughter is an amazing feeling
the builders for the empire state building faced many obstacles
those were the opinions i had on computers
they also help with school or planning a vacation
the second drink source he passed was on abandoned <person> juice factory
<caps> you <month> even forget the people you know even where you live if you spend to much time on the computer
computers also teach handeye coordination
computer presents to kids through
to that back then they said it was devil music
my parents could not hear us over the storm since they were asleep and we were helpless no matter what we tried
you could tell he was passionate about what she was writing
<caps> team and i sprinted on to the field
one reason is that we know she wont give up
communication with people around the world is a huge advantage
dear local newspaper i believe that computers are a great help to society i will explain my thoughts and ideas to you
the winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting
if the things that are in the book are true or are in real life
another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable
everyone is unique in their own ways
my <caps> <caps> came to the door first to greet us
i shout automatically
or it will help someone find their lost pet
no matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done
in the end our team ended up winning i never complained one time about not being able to serve
meaning that i pinned everyone in the first round
books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world
computers are great for many reasons
the definition of offensive material is simply a matter of opinion
i also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on <caps>
thats the kind of mood in this memoir
you can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers
ran in <caps> uncle room and hug her i said how are you because when i went for <caps> grandmother birthday
laughter soothes the soul and brings joy to any situation
kids today need to spend more time outside then playing games on the computer
the joy of seeing them there was incredible
the movies that are made give a false out look on what sex and intimacy really is
a lot of the parents do not want there kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive
computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways
my father died when i was thirteen and since then i had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life
this would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around which was either practical or safe
laughter bonds people together at any age
she did not say anything but i could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets
imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library
i agree and disagree with the prompt
the era of when the book takes place is also a key factor
i believe <caps> is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to
that is why i think that you can work on the computer
if people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books
it all happened on a <date> <time> <caps> i was heading home from my boyfriends house
first and for most is the fact that this is <location>
computer have a positive effect on people
another example is when i want to do something and my mom say no i always sneak it and get in trouble
laughter is something that everyone shares in common
they have been dating for <num> months
you should go hangout outside
when we were done we started heading back home
they were the difference between them failing or succeeding
you just plug it in and it ells you where go
some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career
these are just some obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock
they were called <caps>
i believe that computers are doing us more good than their harm
everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need
the things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk
i think society spending too much time in the computer
going to the library is such a better solution
that is all you have to do and then it will never bother you again
for all these reasons the mooring mast was doomed from the start
i step on the ice and wait patiently for the puck to come <caps> way
libraries have people that come in and out of the library everyday
one of them was air ships flying too low over urban areas is illegal
<caps> comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better
the mood of this memoir is happy and grateful
<caps> we got into town we stopped by the store
i was looking for <person> and i was waiting for him to be done
so i called my friend on it and she said whose phone are you calling from i said my
laughing is my second language in life
fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to have lighter in the air
one of the greatest obstacle was safety
a good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging
i was also concerned for my brother because he cant speak <caps> very well at all
you get to make your own animation clips or even a movie
my first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses
another reason was nature itself
when we would enter into the school everything would change though and i understood that after about a week
the story says the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face
one day at my school
no matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe
<caps> this mean she loves he parent for every little single thing they did
we were always laughing and happy
the authors parents invited refugees to stay with them until the got back on their feet
we kept the mattress on the top of the stairs and measured out just where we needed my sleeping bag to be
thats why i say do not remove the items
i was patient when my dad said he would get me some <caps>
i was still hungry so we got <caps>
no one leaves a family member out
i get outside and run so that i will not fall victim to weight
once we got their it was so crowded
so as she turns and looks she bursts out into laughter because while his zipper is down he is talking to a group of people that work there
there was water on the ground and he was soaked
i know it sounds stupid but it used to make me happy
they can provide a way to contact others
i was so happy to leave the doctor
this would have made the dirigibles swivel around the mast
no complaining or nothing
some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life
in my point of view strongly believe that it could have been form working at the some sandy desert for seeds a long period of time
he was becoming tired and thirsty
after a few times of using a computer you get <caps> and better it
the flower reminds her of her grandmother
that way you can be sure <money> who you are talking to
this is a story of the time i was patient
there was a rather large snake in his path
this would make it very difficult to control the dirigible
but then looked up everything i needed to known in an half hour
for example <caps> or twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school
it would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book
they all came to <location> hardworking and willing
<person> mentions that he grew up in a close knit community
it is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you
people should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are
sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane
hydrogen is very flammable
computers have all these websites that are full of great information
memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test
its ability to do such should not be compromised
the experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer
the only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire
which led to a teacher coming over and told all of us to come to her
also a computer can help unemployed people find a job
those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip
laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity
so i cant really say if i am for censorship or not
it gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there
he would bring the funniest cards to give us and we would sit there and laugh about them for hours
every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed
i remember <time> year i was doing a report about the <caps> <caps>
sometimes they have to choose between <caps> <num> and <caps> <caps> it depends on how graphic things are
situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves
i retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing <caps> on a rock
it builds you up when you are down
his sense of humor was the best i had encountered and it made my heart run wild
still the <time> was filled with laughter
not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows
all of can happen from staying off of computers
my little brothers and my two cousins
books all have those things to someone some where
i shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap
they made a simple little house into a great home for everyone
we told her we needed eye drops for me
there are thousands of libraries throughout the world
she will be more confident
i felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me
computers save time and make your life easier
some <month> take offense to that
i say happy because the author was happy to enjoy having so many friends and family to come over everyday and have fun
i guess it really was one of those <caps> had to be there kind of moments
some of the games are educational also
thank you for taking the time to read my opinion
but the only people that actually benefits in life are the website owners
over the years i learned about patience
once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems
i have learned that laughter is a top basis for any relationship
students <month> be dancing to their favorite song
there was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities
as i said before they can help people learn
some are just the artist sing and dancing in a background other times people make fun of other artists
<num> longer then we thought
people who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that effects them negatively
the last obstacle faced by builders was that state law <caps> aircraft flying as low as the mooring mast
these hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water
i get giddy as i take giant sneaky steps to it
he tells them how much courage they have and thanks so much for leaving their jobs
<location> is supposed to be a free country
people need to make jokes and they need to have laughter and comedy in their life
those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer
let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility
the hydrogen could catch fire and fall onto pedestrians
sometimes the articles in books are old and
they were all from different parts of the world and got along and he even though they had there differences they got together as friends
one day me and my brother went hunting at <caps> oaks
i hit him twice in the side of the cheek so he told me i had won
those are the moods that i think the author created during the memoir
<person> went to <organization> and told he would help and in <num> minutes they finished
when you are new at <caps> good to make other people laugh specially when its not at you directly
the cyclists determination went down as long as he was riding
first obstacle they had to make the mooring mast safe for passengers to board on and off
thinking hard about the situation <organization> finally caved in and told them yes but then gave conditions
had a nice mean <person> them out and they went to <organization> lets to get food
libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out
keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a better suited way instead of banning the books altogether
people are making <money> every year with the help <money> computers
people that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children
and everyone needs to get past the offensive side and get to a level where everyone sees eye to eye
like i said everyone is different
a century ago talking to people instantly seemed just about impossible
i have to disagree with the supporters of technology
there was a law that prevented
it is necessary for our society to have computers
this is one reason why libraries are so popular among all people
and in paragraph <num> it states i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
this leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear
also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it
i use the computer offer for fun and research
i strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people
there are many things a person can do on a computer
a lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers
if people removes them so people wont come back to that libraries
computers and other technology make the way easier
imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song
mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me
the people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read
materials should not be removed from libraries
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
with literature its about conveying ones thoughts and feelings about a story or other subject
but computers can be a bad thing
family trip <caps> the <date> my family and i decided to have a trip to <location>
i can not explain how hard my family and i laughed together just from looking at one picture
by saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then
but one thing that they have in common is laughter
but i think that we need to find a balance between the two
when my mom and i were siting in the deer blind she was getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came
laughing makes you feel warm and invited to have fun
people always doubted him and never gave his music a chance
they help communicate around the world
the cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tiered and dehydrated
sometimes just laughing for no reason is the most fun
laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well
she thanked me for my patience
all the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny
the second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
<person> knew that for one
also weather was a huge obstacle
because not all people have the same interests
all of the flowers reminded her home country
i do believe computers have a positive effect on people
<person> had taught me how <caps> appreciate laughter at a time <caps> sorrow
also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade
also it would not matter to me how the library is run
it causes violence among people
it was only seconds before <caps> was gone and everyone in the room was silent and i cried over her limp no longer smiling body
think about that one
when she said i did it on the wrong page
movie for the last hour
making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material
but i waited and waited
the author even describes his community as a
that why i think they should be remove
society today relies heavily on computers and the net work their keeps us all connected
that statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart
it will have a negative effect on your child
this is <caps> first reason
computers always warn us about them
in the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways
the world cannot afford to censor
he can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steals or rents them from our local library
now that you know my personal views about the censorship in libraries understand that not everyone is the same
it is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world
censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country
<caps> is happy that <caps> grew up in <location> and how grateful <caps> is to them for passing down their traits and loves to him and all their hard work
when their are long lines or something and your not patient people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you
that kids name was <person>
i have told her i went to <organization>
no one is forcing you to read it or look at it
the society as a whole had lost <caps> human emotions and became submissive to the government
these things could go up two <num> miles per hour
the empire state building was not a good place to attach a blimp to
games such as these help in reallife situations
there other friend picked up to bring bad news he was back in <location>
have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your ever day life
last <date> he proposed
this affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated
each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology
it is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer
all four of us were hanging out that day
the setting around him also made him have negative thoughts
the experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the empire state building
the only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived
a study done by <organization> shows that mere the <percent> of kids go on their computer when they cant be outside
which means they will most likely stay back
he is always hipper and ready to go
is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting
my main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book
<caps> is noting wrong with that
i believe that computers benefit society
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
and it was just to make the building bigger
be intouch with faraway relatives
i used to love hermit crabs
i know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things
parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such seeing something that a toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see
architects went through many obstacles in building masts
just because they have been kept away from all that all there life
his water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason
while walking around the ponds i started to slide on the ground
thats ninetyfive percent of people who are learning more handeye coordination
my parents use email all the time
no laughter without love
that was a good wet day at the beach
freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded
this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
i shifted around under my blanket so i could face her
some of us like to buy or sell things on the computer or do our homework
when we got there it was a long line to get in
you have the power to make a difference in your real lives
different people like different things
at the time the <caps> was the fastest <caps> around
on the bright side we got to sit down
computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things
i had just met such an alluring new person
this is one of the largest apple orchard in the area i lived in
many books that <month> be found offensive are historical
he could not get any water or any directions
<caps> takes two seconds
this means he is happy and loves his parents have done
<caps> dad put on <organization> and we laughed the rest of the night away
instructors report that <organization> skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past
another positive fact about computer is that you can find all the information you need and fast
this made me smile it was so beautiful
i screamed when i opened her up
so this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or group of people find offensive
i strongly believe that computers are bad and people spend to much time on them
it will make you feel a whole lot better
he was the uphill on a rocky rollacoaster
i believe this because computers provide us with communication skills
i got to hang out with my dad and i found out how much fun he is and how funny he can be
the moment seemed to stretch and expand in time
his pocket started to vibrate
libraries should censor some of there material
one term of communication that came out recently is <caps>
i could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is
but computers cannot simulate fresh air and exercise
she relates the flower and geese to herself
that is not a good thing at all
as you can see in the memoir the author felt happy and grateful <caps> of the love and sacrifice of his family
the children will hear it or see it again soon or later
i went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not
i think that they should throw this book away
i sure love it when others make me laugh too
that one day but i did no where so do when it
the dirigibles weight would have to be able to be held safely
laughter just happens in many ways it can
computers have a positive effect on people and the society
the setting of the authors shortcut effected his performance and strength tremendously
every work would be remove because at least one person is offended <caps> every work of the sort
to sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination
people learn too much on it
it shows the mood of how he loves his house
they make everything easier for me by making me laugh
censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society
libraries have all kinds of people walking in and out everyday
violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast
and they older what then what they say
it will still be around
contained hydrogen rather than helium
now in <date> season we are hoping to repeat state champs
people can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or illegal things
he lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory
i think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life
if people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight
as i climbed it became increasingly warm then i broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight
these designers had more than a mundane idea but it was shot down with the multiple obstacles that arose
she met a man on <caps>
he wants to be alive
the cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with his name written over them
many people in the <location> read
being a dork <month> just be the best way to be in a healthy relationship
this is not good for a growing teen
<person> is also inspired by the hibiscus who is strong enough to make it through the cold months thats what matters
in the end it all paid off
many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life
there is little water and it is boiling hot
the computer is good for connecting to people around the world
the book should not be taken away from other people just because someone <month> be offended by it
laughing was big part in our conversations
the <caps> loves his parents because of their sacrifice and love
i wanted to quit dance but it was a talent i had that i wanted to keep doing
the lack of landing area was of the the challenges
this undeniable thankfulness is a large part of this memoir
he of course was soaking all the attention in
i say this from experience
without them i would not know what laughter is
this is a problem because hydro gen is highly flammable
<caps> loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him
my second reason is to talk on the
at lunch that <date> we decided on trying to do all of the ideas because we had <date> days to hang out
a kid walks into the library up town
so she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patience and she will <caps>
that is one time when people were patient with me
kids should be exercising outside not siting at home on the computer
my little sister said that it was the best <date> present ever
at the end the author says i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
that was a day i had to be very patient
usually the first impression will identify the connection you have with that individual
when you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one
she will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life
i am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries
whats on television <month> be considered street smart education but that is good
one reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it
in conclusion everything i have said about why being on the computer too long is bad for you proves that too much computer is bad for people
i think is a positive effect on people
self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world
i believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself
docking a dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers
i rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face
one and tie <caps> pill does on the them
can we watch <organization>
some <caps> classics are also being speculated against
that is the time i was to be patient
it shows the theme of the story really
some say computers are not good because people are not enjoying nature
<caps> mine is patience is rewarded
my first point is that you can get a better education using them
in the <date> he tries out for <caps> baseball
to strip the rights of a person is not acceptable
an that means <percent> of the people wont have jobs
they must be able to work well with their hands to fix it
<caps> the good thing is you guys were so patience
then my mom took me to the hospital where she works
i cherished the time i had with her and now i have to wait to have a laugh with her
then he did a couple of answers
popular websites like <caps> make this extremely easy
and even in construction business
the computer or great way to find a job
we were on a train going to <location>
another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature
its the persons choice whether or not they read or listen
being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts
i took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing
id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate
this setting affected the character mood
everyone is faced with choices in life
well they should know that it can harm there kids and it can also teach there young kids bad stuff
music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics
this is my take on the whole situation
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus
there are also the more grown up kid movies like <organization> <caps>
<caps> would always go in the refrigerator and just <caps> at the egg cartons and double check if anyone was around
also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for
financial loss is something that many people are concerned about
some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact
in the <date> i had a rough volleyball season
those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story
all these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now
to ignore leaves you in fear
yes some movies have foul language but people still enjoy it
another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now
one chilly <date> <time> i was in my mothers room and i saw her doing her makeup
the reason this article is also happy is shown in <caps> <num> when he talks of the endless celebrations or a love of cooking that is still with me today
the biggest reason was for safety precautions
there is a question that ponders in my mind
then my two bottom teeth
i am a very patient person
in many schools students ask their friend a question about homework
i had to be patient when my brother broke his finger
people like joking around with others
so i always just be myself around everyone i come around
typing is a big part of your life
we started up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down taunting us
movies that are rate <caps> and above should be removed
computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information
censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society
computer put negative affects on people of all and i think we should stop and think about what we are doing
the only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian
if they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store
<caps> the sales man giving me a little shrug
the cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town
every book should be in the library
and <caps> kicks <person> to the tree
i always patiently wait to see her again but it is hard if you know what i mean
i told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
by the time i got home i was going to be late
i was waiting for her for a long time
it would either be verbally or physically
i learned a little lesson that day
so i think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things mite change
they should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it
computers are great and you should use it
any type of game they are all on the computer
in the progress the computer has put over <num> of single people and expressing the relationship
computers organize data by keeping documents in different files computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career
that night i think <caps> whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine
why are computers so addicting well they have instant message you can talk to people around the world
i wrote a speech in which i explained my talents and the many things i enjoy
the final reason why we use computers is education
they would <caps> over sixty thousand dollars of modifications
only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer
when we got to our friends house we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us
everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes
we sit awkwardly in the car all the way to a small dinner called <organization>
then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car i got so embarrassed and starting laughing again
in conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons
i do think they should just be placed in different areas
these obstacles put and end to the dream of having mooring mast on top of the empire state building
the terrain had made him drenched in sweat
then they added two more floors to the top of the building
effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all
there is also morals behind them
everyone but <caps> was trying to make fun out of the rest of the <time>
so <caps> did you start to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun
on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures
these are only some things i can do on my computer
the builders of the empire state building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
this illustrates the power of computers allowing people to do things that were once impossible
with a click of a button and saves you time driving to the stores
the mood is both grateful and happy
computers have had a negative impact on society
which would affect the building
another obstacle the builders faced was the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting
technology has been growing and changing rapidly
it takes hard work to be patient
you can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer
the present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes
after she pushed me into the mud i got up and started laughing my head off
this would add stress to the buildings frame
i got my purse and looked in my wallet
computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems
there was nobody around her to help
first <caps> should use computers because if they wanted to take notes on what their doing they can just go on the computer and write it
people would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature
one of the most common and used thing around the world is instant <caps>
that quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life
i heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me i thought i would never make any friends
they just type in what they want to say and out it comes
this gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic
the way in which the author honors his parents makes the story very enjoyable
this can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers
if you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive
it was about a white dog and a dark colored dog together trying to find food and a place to sleep
if your ever <caps> trouble on something you could always look up information about it
and there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures
then finally i was playing every note
the mood is uplifting and the author shows a lot of gratitude
this is a horrible thing to do to yourself
i had two wait five hours before my grandma to get to my house
this sight was troubling
censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them
<caps> is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag
but it is still too low for the laws
by just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side
its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh
computers are they lot us chat with friends and family
that is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about <caps>
this gives him hope and reassurance
also there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas
we can see what happens on the other side of the world
they also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all
an i can check how <caps> teams are doing
when i went to the store i seen all the <caps> things
we need to have rules in libraries
and for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly i thought i was dreaming
many dilemmas and complications the builders faced
so i just thought <caps> was doing something for work
they all understood the difficulty of getting out
there are many bad things that result from computers
the author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage
i think that laughter is important to have in any kind of friendship
there should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history
my grandpa was the first to walk in
they would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves
like the title states the setting of this story was a rough road ahead
now i consider myself a young adult and i believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong
so the experts have no reason to <caps> that because people use the computer to keep in touch with families
having to computers can help students to learn
like <caps> my brother got sent back to jail
the ride by the way was extremely amazing
<organization> and i were just trying to hurry and get our work finished so that we could go back to our homes and shower
i had played my <caps> <caps>
computers make our lives easier
the builders and architects were not looking at the problems that would be present but only at how to build the most
but i still hoped everything would be fine
if a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book
after all the hard work to be successful
this was a top obstacle to overcome
she had that special power of making me laugh no matter what
because i only enjoy reading about the romance
i was even closer to <caps> then in the first term
<caps> and i had both been through some rough times in the past few months
above a densely populated area
<caps> i know i said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this
another obstacle in the way was nature itself
all these features of the setting affect him
she told a bunch of friends and me about it
the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents
people spend to much time on computer
some country singers can be like that to because all the sing about is getting drunk then having sex
next she did the chores
if its cold you need a jacket
the library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books
i had finally decided to sign up and join the team
older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack
most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are
this happens a lot to average people
lastly you can use a computer write finds of letters
books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal
no one told you that you had to read it
he told her he thought she was beautiful and had an amazing smile
growing up i knew my friends as a second family
many other books exist as these
this also allows a variety of books to a variety of people
the man would curse his lungs out
the extreme heat of the summer definitely put a strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water
people believe in different things
this is also bad because if the blimp moves or the building sways into the building than one or the other could break
i was very different because i had curly hair and was short
<organization> replied back to her i love you
then we pasted by a photo booth were they took a picture of you dressed up as if you were a pilgrim
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
he gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation
when she came out of her office i was holding my moms hand
the advances in technology with computers benefits the society
laughing brought people to me because it made me seem like a friendly fun person that i am
the mood created by the author in this memoir is love
this law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the empire state building
without the computers help we would all have to write all of our papers out
certain material such at rated <caps> movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable
<caps> example on <organization> you find what ever street you want
overall i do not think libraries should take out these materials
then you have exactly the same right
whatever the cause <month> be they have the right to expose their children to anything they see appropriate
so this guy is getting it pretty rough
this quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going
if everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary
it out of there we were so patient
the author states the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
<caps> since jack was a lot older than <person> and <caps> was his brother <caps> had to watch him a lot
these computers also improve social skills
for about a second anyway
<caps> second reason that it teach hand eye coordination
this makes the cyclist thirsty and tired
there are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas
she felt that life was full of hope again
and for the first time that day i thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay
it is just another natural emotion any person is born with
if they spend too much time on the computer they are more likely to fail their classes
i screamed so loud that my other cousin yelled from up stairs to be quiet
i know you certainly will agree
since he is talking about his family of course he is going to <caps> loving
there was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their
we made our way to the table in the back where <caps> and <person> were already sitting
music is also one of the important thing that is carried in any school library or any public library
it just sounds so happy and loving to me
the more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier
come look for yourself
a blimp can easily be blown into a close buildings sharp spires and pop because of winds
the other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building because its illegal
i went on my acer and type th e ten page paper
i had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away
being around people that make you laugh is always a good way to put yourself into a good mood
a great mental image of serenity and peace
i often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
do you want to decide for yourself or have some one with you every step of the way
many people say that laughter is the key to life
so in my opinion there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library
people who are sitting on the computer are not getting exercise or seeing beautiful nature
one obstacle was safety
i suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it
i was trying to throw a frontfull for cheer
another example is when the author tells the reader that his parents showed him two important lessons that he chose for the basis of his life
books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions
even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around
we passed a bunch of people that we knew
<person> has been very patient for the past couple years
i think that computers have a bad effect on people
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications
people who wish not to see the writers message have the right not to
the times <caps> do go outside is for simple tasks such as taking out the trash
patient is when you are tolerant and understanding
all the cool <caps> once had was thrown out the window
when i got to <person> house the first thing we did was play video games
i once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library
i have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that i actually did stand there and talk about myself
they never can do anything like going outside and doing sports
they you might be out of luck for what you are looking for
places through out my life
<person> and i look at each other and i knew <caps> he was thinking
when i looked back at my mom she look like she was having a really bad day
the author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this
feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story
he was riding along on a route he had little confidence would end up anywhere
<caps> finally around <num> pm my parents came home and i asked about the sleepover
asks four year old <person>
computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages
people steal so they can buy extra technology
so she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed
ill support them in the following paragraphs
it happened here at <organization>
friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them
we went on tons of sweet rides and got <caps> <caps> for dessert
all of these types belonging to a certain decade
this proves that there were <caps> with empire state building that they worked around
i am different and kind of an outcast
if you feel like you do not know many interesting subjects like a culture of some sort or something that you heard your computer can tell you
we started the day just laying in her bad and watching a movie on her tiny <caps>
this problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the building of the mast continued
it is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to offensive content
they also teach you new things
by sitting up straight in your computer chair all day can improve your posture
they have a nice home nice friends and a good and caring family
finally i saw another player and got ready to shoot
it will be hilarious
he gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground
the conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him
i was with my friends watching movies
it reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish
if they are found offensive to the public
the topic was dropped and never brought up again until the <date> i saw him
you would be ignorant to think they would go out to play
what ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete <caps>
first of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you cant do anything
censorship in libraries has gotten to strict making the next generation miss key lessons learned about life
the constantly shifting winds would make it hard to stay landed unless they were weighed down
there are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone
so the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers
her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday
it was this simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday
i was really upset that <organization> made such a silly mistake
and they checked my knee
therefore worries of problem like this have already been solved
he was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around
patience is difficult to do
there will always be something out there that you wont approve of
when i got to school i grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign
there is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something
the efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks
what will happen how is it going to end <caps> mind was full of questions
they still had to got to school
todays society is all about the freedom to allow anything to happen than is acceptable
you will get bad grades in school
people can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on the their computers because your brains are like computers
simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task
many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them
i believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
so go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive
a time when i was patient
i think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created
the builders were unaware of the obstacles to come
this is one reason why the <location>
i remember one time a few years ago
a child or young adult <month> learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials
we laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt
i disagree with the idea of censorship
<caps> told me to have some patient so i did
and think about how much computers have done for you
we all agreed it was a splendid idea
there is this cool website called <caps>
this quote shows that the mood the author changed to be very loving
i almost peed my pants when i read that
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
we were patient enough to stay till the end of the game
my favorite part of the hole trip wear those tracks
thats the time when i was patient
if a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer
those fun things can lead to laughing
to finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year
computers really help the elderly out a lot
if judge a book bye its first couple paragraphs you would never get a meaning out of it
to be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and i would have never been reunited
<person> divulged into his story causing tension in the air
that many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative
you have to have patience while going hunting
the are thousands of games to chose from
let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler
the mood created by the author is happy
the whole memoir gives off a very positive attitude
this is because most people are usually on their computers
many features of the setting affected him
i believe the correct answer is computers
i thought about it for r a moment and realized its quit true
the most blatant one was the height at which they would dock
for normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter
any book could be offensive to any one person
the money the give to the government is to take care <money> the homeless people
its also nice to just take a <date> off and <caps> up to <caps> <caps>
the boys all think that its <caps> and that thats what every girl is supposed to look like
but only one good thing i got was missing school
people are different in many ways
the first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new
his very happy he came from such friendly family
one time <caps> <caps> was siting watching t
and there are tons of more things you can do
even with the house being so great my favorite part wear the rail rode tracks
it was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working
this the the thing that i find most disturbing about some materials
its just one right after another it wont stop
the librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it
critics <month> think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family
a time when i was patient was at the doctors
we need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn
so we have been in classes together previously
<caps> effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight
if you said no i can tell you how
<caps> means hes starting to realize his waters running short
remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful i am for <caps> friends
<caps> the vegetables out of it
these are the problems they faced
the fourth hour i slept till about <time> thats what my sister said
as teen who attends school i know that i would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer
i have seen as definite decline in family enrollment
using the computer is a quick and easy way to get these answers
animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist
the mood was very serious and grateful
there is a wide array of music that people can enjoy
one of the obstacles they faced was having to make changes to the steel frame of the building in order to have the strength to accommodate the new situation
identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common
the greatest obstacle to the successful of the mooring mast was nature itself
there is no need to be rude
he describes how his extended family always nearby
we then progressed through the hatchery and soon returned to the car and made our trip to <organization>
and i say that to an extent
i was so happy that me being patient had finally been something worth
<person> handed her phone to one person at a time and we all started to laugh again asking for <person> to send the picture to each of them
computers do have positive effects on people
technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way
this effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy
around <num> to <num> million <caps> have this device to use
his blue eyes sparkled with curiosity
i remember the morning he called me and told me his mom was dead on the floor in her bedroom
so i still had to wait
articles about views on the death penalty
one strong example of this is how he expresses his parents
my first reason is people can meet new people
she listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun <caps> she used to be
<caps> <person> gave her stuff <caps> me and gave <person> a piggy back ride
i decided to go to my friend
so finally we made it to <location>
my friend still says that it was the best day of her life
for example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face
that started slowing him down
a majority of people would say yes
and thats why i think the author ended with that paragraph
the builders of the empire state building faced some problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there
as soon as i got it i stared reading it
all on different websites of course but thats beside the point
make the smart choice
computers also have different <caps>
i think that the reason why we were laughing was because we were doing dumb stuff
most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive
all she have to do is try harder and she maybe will be able to pass his test
i like being outside more than inside and i have straight as
when i was a little girl i was never had any patience and even now
i can take over your life
he is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals
the bus appeared and a sense of joy appeared with it
we should teach people about them
the hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother
no book should be taken off the shelves for any reason
she would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home
another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because <caps> are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside
i highly disagree and i think its a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generations hands to read
the author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over
there are plenty of books out there and many different authors that the person can choose from
mostly good things by the way
you have a choice to read or watch something
we go inside and theirs <caps> decorations as far as the eye could see
you then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard
i think that is the peoples desire to know everything and be smarter than other people or competitions
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
it also give the feeling of respect
thats a time i was patient
in my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days
<caps> will never be forgotten
this a time when i was patience and when i want other people to be patience
people all judge things differently
you cant just have a library all to yourself
many people think that <organization> is just like any other
the funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were
that percentage is expected to grow to <percent> in the next <num> years
so as we got back in the car i stayed up the rest of the way there
i realized that he was absolutely right
this information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children
i could feel the sweat drip off my face
anything and everything is educational in its own way
this is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made peoples lives better
the author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason
without a computer life would be much more difficult
i told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late
<caps> type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it
this is helpful students could and the world or about a different this remind me of the time i had to <caps> a project about the nine planets
a reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family
movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape
doing that with their life
even movies and music can be offensive to some people
i no longer needed to act as if i had known him for years
most have holy books and writings
a library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place
was so that dirigibles can stop and refuel
its the inevitable truth
<caps> left to go talk to my parents
everyone in the world has different opinions
we grew to love each other and bonded as a team
i yelled to my <caps> as i walked out of my room
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
i remember when i read about the year old girl on new channels
<caps> you get addicted then you will not do your homework then your grades will drop
kids watch movies in class all the time
every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person
dirigibles need a large area to land
some very adults have and various other things that i cannot the life of me think of <caps> thing computer get them together and they are happy
people will spend less time staying active
removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed
i looked back at one girl and she walked towards me
and the laughs can go on again
<caps> said in a perky voice
that would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they cant
helium is more flammable
in the excerpt from the mooring mast by <organization> builders must faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
then you saw her smile
safety is one <organization> the most important things in life
a poll even says that <percent> of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer
its also bad because kids read it and start doing what they say in the magazine
laughter is a big part in my relationship
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder
i think that this story was very touching and created a lot of mood and emotion as i was reading
the ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story
<caps> loved them and they were happy spending time with each other
taking media off the shelves is not needed
you can look up stuff on the <caps> for your homework and other stuff
the choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents
i agree with the censorship in libraries today
in the end i think that computers are a real waste of time
but the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh
a thousandfoot dirigible moored at the top of the building
thats understandable but everyone else should not be exempt
this could be a very bad influence
i know you will agree with me when i say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves
nature is one of the most beautiful things on this planet
whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books
learning to not sweat the small stuff is really important
we arrived to find that <caps> had already gone home for the night
after in done writing have to put all the materials away and then put the letter in the mailbox and walk all the way back
the reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now
something has to be done to put an end to this madness
i think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge
we comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting <caps>
the author showed us a calm and grateful mood for everything that have happened
and it has even been able to bring me together with other people
the author of this passage seems very happy about the way her life is today
he shows that in growing up in such a wonderful <caps> <caps> family and home that he felt that the experience he had in his home was just exceptional
after the paper work we had to wait another week because they had to fix him
i had to wait for a long time
she started telling me a story about how every year her family would take a weekend beach trip
and their are many people and other building in <caps> that could be put in danger
so i was patient playing in my room with all my toys
that day was the worst day of my life
were down to <num> seconds now
from that day forward we hung out as often as we could
needed to be answered and thats when shed to comfortable to take it
the setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist
he also talks about how he and most people are grateful for family and friends
in order to maintain healthy you have to eat right and good in riding a bike
the mood of this memoir is one of love and kindness
also whenever you got food was not enough
were working on the thing now
the whole time i was thinking to myself
also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced were too much to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast
dirigibles usually land in an open field where they could be anchored by lead
my second opinion on computer is that
we were in the middle west of <location> and the mountains were so beautiful
but back to report cards we opened them and then everyone was happy even <caps> because we got good grades
many people have different views and opinions on things
he also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things
we had numerous amounts of laughing sessions throughout dinner
weeks went by and still no boots
about <num> years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups
so when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place
they are so independent they do when they go home from school is eat and play on the computer
<caps> the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and cooperation would be useless
first being on a computer using the mouse is helping your handeye coordination
now you can probably see why i think we need computer and how it can sometime benefit our society
<organization> said yeah sure
you have another virus
the final reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his hardworking parents
the world would be a much different place without computers
many people wanted it to be censored
not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books
i tried sleep but it was very uncomfortable that us the most uncomfortable plane ride of my life but i had to be patient and how its over
you and i both know that every one needs a <caps>
my final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits
so i asked the guy is it done he said not yet i was watching him doing another guys hat
her name was <person>
they are able to make everyday life easier
in paragraph <num> it states skills and love of cooking that is still with me today
people are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health
they just give us what we need and want
this gives off a very happy and cheerful mood
so she decided that she would get a job
back home it just grew wild
<caps> like there is no tomorrow
there was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas
sometime life is complicated
this made the cyclist tired and weary
it was so good it was gone soon as she had put it out when i say soon i mean soon
the greatest obstacle is the violent air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast
when the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there
in this article talks about a young man named <person> and how his life was from then and now
last the winds at top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents this means all the framing workers went through hell to make the building
i love talking to <caps> friends
these people tend to not go outside at all and stay home
after wards i felt a big relief to get it over with
even though thats possible there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
the things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world
my first reason why i feel that computers have bad effects is
so thats a good thing
battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist
they always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love
people should be able to watch what movies they want
professor <person> had this to say about how this is affecting <caps>
we were laughing so hard that <organization> fell off of her bed
well thats what computer are for
watch <caps> or <organization> not <caps> on a <caps>
his determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes
i will say know to magazines because it be to much in that
it is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do
<num> min later i decided to go back home
the author created a very loving mood in this memoir
a final obstacle the builders faced was the advancement with airplanes and that made it difficult for dirigibles to be the prime source of aeronautical transportation
my third and final reason is computer give you exceptional handeye coordination can because i know accountant
when i arrived back at the hotel i could feel the tension as soon as i walked into the room
was neither practical nor safe
so the builders made a mooring mast so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building
they finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a <num> bedroom apartment
because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water
for example in the story he says id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate
another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety
computers can be a success to some people
owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too
<caps> had a valid point
to me computers are positive
his friend <person> sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom
when i am talking to my friend i can say anything that i think is funny and i know he will laugh at it
schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
i thought he was most likely eating or sleeping so i decided to just go inside and eat
plus sex makes books better
this was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock
no one wants a stay at home unemployed loser as themselves
another example is in <caps> <num>
i herd that criss rock almost died
this effect is positive because it helps everyone stay in touch
when the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no
this could help the people avoid such things
after i got my new bike and i was patient
everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies
my last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family
if we allow this right then these libraries which allow individuality would not be able to exist
the second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places
so she did i did not feel better so i just went home to sleep
one girl sits by her computer doing homework
make a section in at the back of the library and ask for <caps> to confirm that there old enough
its way more important than that
well i would waited <caps> went past no sign of a letter from him
this reminds me of a true story i know because i was there
the <caps> <caps> was to be able to design the mast without having to reconstruct a big part of the building
the next week a went <caps> the nursing home
no one should have to worry about being offended when they walk into a place of learning and knowledge
a computer can also make signs for a business or business cards
i hope you chose to inform others with this information
so to be nice i let her in front of me
the parents or even kids are not spending lots of time with each other due to the computers
my <caps> came over and put her bowl down then went back into the kitchen to get something
according to the excerpt over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework
would add stress to the buildings frame
before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it
i danced with my parents for a long time and then i would play games with my brother and friends
i remember when i read about <caps> warming on the computer
every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community
but we shared a room so that would only make it worse
as i got ready <num> while my position paper this year
i completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today
the <organization> were on is called <organization>
she is also describing that they will start over when spring comes
laughing will probably help
one last reason was an actual law
many people find this offensive
standing there in the blazing hot sun on <num> <caps> days i was having second thoughts
this means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation
i bailed to the other line
also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain
also the environment of were he was growing up taught him that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
he fought in the <location> war
handeye is involved with almost everything you do
we want to keep your children away from the bad things
in the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say at home
i believe that libraries should not have censorship
the point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in <location>
a <caps> <caps> i once heard laughter is the best medicine
i had to wait for my mom to get home and to to me but i was scared but i was patient
so he starts pumping and sees black gunk
the first obstacle was concern of public safety
and the final example is when he mentions that lots of his family and friends grace their kitchen table more times than not
she also realized that she will never forget her home but she still can move on
so they <caps> from letting them dock there ever again
they might think that it should be removed from everywhere
the <caps> had to put another sixty thousand dollars into it because of the modifications
laughing is the biggest quality to have in someone
if your worried about it take a break from it for a while
life would be sad and depressing if there was no such thing as laughter
all and all that <date> was one of the most funniest summers i have ever had
this is what i think the mood of the article is about in the memoir
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
the computer <month> give you the wrong info
laughter keeps <caps> and i close
this law would make it impossible to ever make it a full use of transportation
we pretended that the grass was lava and the concrete was a place for break dancing in cave man days
but for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts
this was because all information was found in books
if individuals find the material offensive they should turn their back and not read or watch the programs
computers also let people learn about new things
we then realized the trail was most likely made by animal
laughing keeps people together and makes relationships grow stronger
first obstacle was designing strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigibles load and wind pressure
it had come down to the fifth and final set were we would either win or lose
<person> is thankful that he got the opportunity to grow up in such a great house and community
but thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project
another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows
<percent> of the population of <location> said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen
we both started laughing and i was so glad she helped me out or i would have been late to class on my <caps> day
the person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material
most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not
the warrior was the teacher and <person> was the student
having computer at home is not good specially to children
no matter what your interested in freedom was gave to you so use it
if you think about it i get my mom <percent> of the time and my dad <percent> of the time
we cant stop it but we can try and keep it out of there eyes
keep the books on the self
i was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean
the example tells how she feels down about failing the test
a small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude
from my own knowledge and views of the world i will give you my argument on censorships and how they effect libraries
that was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration
i could wait until my turn
the mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways
<caps> even gained me one of the most beautiful girl i had ever seen
there is much censorship that occurs in the world
computers are the future and its a good one
i have people who stay up for our their paper
the mood of the author and the memoir was happy
they also give people facts about faraway places
read the title before you pick up the book
from then on <organization> and i became best of friends and the times got better and funner
why should you right <caps> you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper
which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it
libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things
i believe peoples lives have been overcome by technology
so what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info
there are even online dating sites and matchmakers
you went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right
eating for hours each day to not a good idea
i would have to say yes to that question
it really is magical
it could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies
my friend <organization> received a random phone call in the <time>
i was getting all <caps> when i did not have my computer
that boy now lives happy with <caps> mom in high school patiently moving along the end
everything was going upside down
i of course said yes
his simple house was a home
he led us to a little room then left
another obstacle that they faced is that dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over suburban areas
she is used to the flower being in a warm environment
her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared
i want to see that word and feel its full effect
the point of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the empire state building builders were trying to make a reality
i believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive
it was one of our fondest memories together
thats because of computers
<caps> i was like <caps> <person>
when you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late
it read rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
the next day we went to the doctors office to have a look at my foot
when <caps> <person> came out she asked a man in to see her with his son
it would cause much argument among people
this is a serious concern to our health
seventytwo percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight
we had to stand outside to wait for the bus
its always important to stay fit and healthy
the best way to know someone is possibly feeling better is laughter
my self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of
it makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together
it was time for me find new waters to swim in
i had mistaken the gas for the break and i ran into the garage door
they can be done only by the help of a computer
she was like a second mother to me for several reasons
and thats what mood the author feels in the story
reading can help a child to expand their imaginations
there was one person that i noticed was in multiple of my classes
they gave us two and half hours for the test
not only is <caps> happening in the libraries its happening on televisions also
now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored
we waited all day until it was dark again then we packed up and we left
this takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this
everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction
in conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story
we both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever
he eats a small lunch and right back to playing
the stress of a dirigibles load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the buildings foundation
we looked like two little kids playing in their dads clothes
the frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast
this is a story about one time i when my mom was patient
the spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it
the girl misses her homeland
it somehow always found its way into our relationship
she has remembered this special rule of home happiness
when ll was going to <location> with my family i had to be patient
due to the height of the empire state building the wind became a major factor
interacting is a nice enjoy nature and have fun
being a fan of her i would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool
<caps> wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then <caps> sees it the abandoned factory
the only way to solve this problem was with lead weights
this would play a roll on children that use this library also
there are a lot more good than bad things
another obstacle the builders would have to face is that since a dirigible used hydrogen it would be highly flammable
since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world
music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing
my day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me
but it is not something that had to be done all the time
on my last trip at <caps> point i made a horrible mistake
then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf
i saw the fury in <location> eyes
this was my dads second car he ever had with a <num> and a <num> speed anything was possible
but when someone looks at the facts a computer is a great thing to own
<person> would exercise everyday after work for two hours
dear local newspaper
belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words
one major problem was the stress added to the buildings frame when the dirigible wore it at the top of the building
there would be nothing left
if you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there
we had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped
it was already <num> in the <time> and we were still on a sugar high
if libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries
when i saw the amount of mud being hurled everywhere i jumped behind <person> and used him as a shield from the mud
the author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story
its impossible to type an essay without a computer
computers can give many chances for exploring education
because you cant build something with it being against the law
when the game was done most people walked away sad but i walked away happy and sad
to the buildings foundation
sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes
if you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride
the author just loves to write and should not have to think of all the concerns that they should just not worry about
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
they should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things
we develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings
life is what it is from contributing factors
computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable <caps> and the can be fun too
<caps> prefers not to know where her meat came from
one of the times that i had to be patient was when i wanted my ears pierced
sometimes you cant even find a book with out bad things in them
materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library
dear <caps> and <caps> of the <location> <caps> i think that computers are a good thing to use
men and women go to public libraries to learn
i think computers have a huge effect on people
i can tell u who wants to do that
if she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take
some <caps> even give computers to kids so they can use it to study
i am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them
that is the time i showed patient
but if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie
this conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers
she greatly emphasized warmth and safety
therefore i think that computers harm people and effect them in ways they do not realize
avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them
i do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly
even though movies are kind of different
it was so funny because they had no idea where the yells were coming from so they just kept looking around confused
that was the time is was patient
i think that a library should be just books because that what they are made for
but every one in a while everyone is a little impatient
this question might be answered forever
it is a long story but i will tell you anyways
he was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die
<caps> second reason for this is that anything and every thing you can get on the <caps> you can get from books
if they write literature
obesity in <location> is at an all time high
one reason dirigibles were never docked on the mooring mast was due to the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current
after we had hung out there for about two hours we headed back up to her house
another problem was nature
its better to plan ahead and think of every obstacle before bringing ideas to life
they will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library
people will never leave the house and instead they are on their computer
so when someone is offended thats their problem
a time i was patient was when i had to save up my money to get the new game halo reach
i was okay with it though because thats better than nothing
that is the mood the memoir set of me to understand it
the winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting
<caps> muttered looking away
also now most governments are networked with files on computers
then <num> later we got a table
this taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money
all my friends had it
they cause conflicts in between one an another
<person> suggested the original <caps> of <caps>
i got ready for school after getting out of bed
thats what i thought
the first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful
you become more if you go more it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids
a time when i was patient
the terrain has a great deal to do with it
when we walked inside we noticed how crowded it seemed to be that day as we waited for a table
make use of that thought i just told you
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents
in this day and age computers are used for many things
at times she <month> have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone
every girl for themselves
<caps> thanks her parents for giving her the opportunity to experience a better life
but what some people might not realize is that some of the things that they have at the library might be offensive towards certain people
another thing is the land
it can tell you about crimes that are happening
this final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea
his pediatrician told her that <person> would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair
there is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates
i thank my grandma and all my patients flew away
lastly the mood could be <caps>
the terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts
it is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research
the <caps> job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigible or blimps
for example when want to talk to my cousin that live in <location>
remember bring something to do while your being patient
if the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor
that means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger
not only books but music or movies
well about three years back my brother and i finally figured out how to have a relationship
that is the mood the author gave in this memoir
i was scared because my dad jack died on a plane
a safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the <caps> or people claim them to be
i was glad i was patient or the kitten would have not lived
also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it
their first problem was that it would add lots of stress to the building
by using the computer you get the as a book and easy
she was my better half would sum it all up
this shows sorting like morale of never giving up
we were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves
this lowers the narrators hope of getting there quickly
everybody has a different kind of laugh
the heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists
and the top floors were turned into soda fountain
i said look at the line
they might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up
the greatest obstacle the engineers <caps> in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety
there are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends
its now or never to decide either waste your life on a computer or live your life
<caps> took forever at about two hours for the <organization> to get the shots ready to be used end paragraph start <caps>
it is very important because it keeps you fit and healthy
the other day <caps> family <caps> i went grocery shopping
<caps> i really wanted my dad to put up our new bunk bed
a time that i was patient was when my family and i was going to get <organization> autograph
it was the start of a brand new <organization> <organization> <caps> i had just moved from <location>
laughing has helped us get to having a great relationship were we can tell each other anything
he explains how his parents raised him
then it comes up in about <num> seconds with around <num> links to websites to help you out
there is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something
now i was only waiting on my dad to drive me <caps> and he takes forever
even though you are ill you will still be getting paid because you are still working
i am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school
<caps> appreciates everything the family has done
pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty <caps> their dirigible
you can also talk to different people who like you
i realized that we were going the wrong way
we stifled a small laugh and got on the ride
in the end computers are a necessary item in a business
i have noticed my hand get neater and i can catch a balls with ease now
the setting basically made the story
in this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures
i notices the terrain changing in this quote the cyclists settings <month> have caused confusion
so at the end of the story she said that she will take that test again
dehydration also can be fatal
laughter is what created what has been one of the most important relationships in my life thus far
so i had asked my grandparents if we could go
the topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with
if all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life
click the next link and watch as a beautiful humming bird swarms across the screen of your desktop
she came back upstairs carrying a role of paper towels and a plastic garbage bags
sometimes teachers give assignments out and you have to write an essay
people should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it
that is not a mothers dream to go and do that
life would be much slower without a computer to speed things up
also you will become a lot more interactive with people
movies have ratings like video games do
computers play a big role in the obesity factor
thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things
we all hesitated when we saw his door open
if you go on the computer at <num> then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice
it was a <num> hour flight with a two hour layover in <location>
his perseverance paid off
just keep the peace and give everyone what they want
well thats what a computer for
i stayed at <location> house for the next two weeks
i think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others
so for just <num> reasons i would already rethink
imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then
a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down
everyday i would go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basket ball
its mostly criticism really
this is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry
the computer is also to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people
clothes were getting stained and messy
with this in mind i should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog
we sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane
there have been children who have killed their parents for a video game
one of the obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced to is the safety
which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it wont be hard to convince somebody else
see if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it
<caps> not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake
computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements
it turns out my mom beat me though
it increases a certain blood flow in your brain which helps a person to be more energetic and happy
this can the be the biggest effects on people
losing one can be very sad
well actually i was the only one from my age group that was there on time
as soon as we did he tried to drive through again and got it stuck yet another time
so i had to go walk around with him
thank you for your time
once before i went to <caps> point with my friend <person>
memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation
now she told my family and i that she was badly offended by what they were called and what they were about
computers give you a chance to get your bills paid and do some shopping for a cheaper price
since the are just as equal to everyone else
it the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way
also in paragraph <num> it says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice which again creates a caring mood
now i hope you like the reasons i wrote on why computers are good to have
their was a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater
the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like
its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books
<caps> <caps> your shoulder the kick over
the builders of the empire state building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there
it dint look bad but with what we had bean in we dissuaded to be extra car full
thats how something went wrong
when friends hang out laughter is usually involved
how would you feel if you did that to someone
they could not take this risk
these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist
reading this makes me feel grateful to live in <location>
it is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face
life is a puzzle i can not figure out
so the <location> should think about what i am saying
you can also communicate with people who has an email address
the books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well
passionate <caps> music filled the air
thats big money there
the many obstacles faced by the builders of the empire state building never allowed any dirigibles to land there
the man feels like their is nothing left and its the old men who caused this
if books are censored some people <month> never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them
<caps> part of the mood was happiness
the hardest part was being quiet to
there was also an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas
we ended up talking for two hours
you can learn from the computer
then she took our order
this shows that the builders build a gangplank for people can walk up or down the gangplank safe from the dirigible
people should always treat others the way that they would like to be treated
<caps> was a cry of laughter that filled the room
the remaining girls looked at each other
we as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions
that sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people
kids are never outside again
my dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was
i thinks thats why we have so much fun out there because of him
one problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
but people experience less <money> the outside world when they surround themselves with technology
this shows they feel family is very important to them adding to the mood of family created by the author
the second main reason was winds from nature itself
on her list to call next was me
the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area
the problem i think is people <month> not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it mean
they struggled both personally and financially
we could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something
he is a private first class
i am not one to deny anyone their rights
the car slid into the pole and it was the end of fun
i just put that book down and continue my search
if he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine
i almost had no desire to live
someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want
art should not be censored at all
every little thing <caps> did differently than the average dog made us laugh
most of the time the true facts will always be there
so libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences
he grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off
ill tell you a little about it
<caps> was so embarrassed that we had heard that <caps> had wiped his butt with his hand
all this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad
these examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist
she replied by giving me her name
the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area
so we gust hung out with our friends
<organization> had to go bad
we use that to talk to our friend and family
another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the empire state building were densely populated
people use books to forget their troubles and take a trip to somewhere outside of themselves
i was patient when i had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend <person> was getting me
its like a mother begin in your house
to our new temporary home
i was ready for anything or at least i thought
patience is a very helpful skill to have
these books that we leave behind influence the future of our society
if parents can change they way they raise there children i think the world would be a better place
at the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be <caps> and it will be just like home
thank goodness we were the second ones up
plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee
if you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate
then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist
it also a symbol of her constant blossoming
taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression
the laughter brought us closer and always helped to fix things
there are many reasons that book could be in the library
as the day progressed i found my comfort zone again
in the <location> we have the technology of a computer
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
the final obstacle faced by the empire state buildings mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly
when you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete
it is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb
if lead weights were used they could fall from dirigible and kill civilians
computers are also very good for information as i said earlier
we went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up
this made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
she makes lots of random sounds
i actually had a lot of fun
libraries have always been an outstanding source for information
here is a story of someone i know who is tolerant
so later that nigh we went home really hungry
the new trimester had started and leadership was my second period
my mind started to reel over this sudden question
all i can really say to that is it is their decision
this shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers
the song inspired many of the famous singers you <caps> know
i was with <caps> friend <person> in the trailer park where her dad lived at the time
but because of all those good times we have had laughing
the also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps
there were many obstacles that the architects working on the mooring mast of the empire state building had to face
has lots of fun games you can play
never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise
we are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations
if we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant
over <money> would be needed for this to happen
where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street
i believe that the act of computers overwhelming a persons life should be with in a serious manner
when we got in there it was at least <num> to <num> people it parked
with censorship we eliminate such problems
as i walked in the door i looked at the computer it was still in use
when we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they cant
the air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger
for example he had no water so he was parched
if you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it
using a computer helped hand eye coordination
lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields
some are respect your elders
my stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside
i think its how they get along and if the have somethings on common
if they need it out of site you can always put it on the highest shelf
libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy
another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes
should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries
i remember all the times we would spend outside on humid <date> days
it was loud and stinky
thats why i think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together
he then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide
i also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from
it was a cool <date> <time>
schools and libraries cant really argue with peoples morals or intelligence
there is a student in my school that failed most of his classes
sometimes the kids in my family have games to make each other start <caps>
i am waiting for my party at my dads house this <date> my birthday was on <num> on <date>
resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so its important to consider all options
i told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her
another thing they can do out of a hundred others is let you communicate with other people no matter how far away
i understand the fact that some people take things offensively
in this sentence the author really conveys his <caps> of thanks of his parents to the reader as he praises them
they went down in the series <num>
the desert effects the cyclist real bad
this fateful event happened almost every night
so i say the computer is important in our society
some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically
there are three main reasons why the <caps>
but i guess thats what made it funny
many people in todays world think so
we lost the second set it was and confidence hitter
for our generation and for the many generations to follow
it is east to communicate using a computer
computers are also help young children to old adults learn new things
this made him hang his head as he rode on
knowing that i wont see him in a long time is unbearable
then i realized when your patient you get what you want more often
<caps> had gone to the store earlier that day and had bought everything
my cousin and i were both given the same research paper to do
the features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist
everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch
when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns
all the teenagers were guarded the moment that he had walked through the door
<caps> out the memoir you really start to see the authors opinion of the definition of home and family
as the episode ended i went back to the computer
which states that they were very welcoming and accepting people
and in a way thanks his parents for everything
so finally we went in i was so happy
finally after a day of crying next to her i noticed <caps> kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it
he had to be patient yet again
also you can get information on places you will visit
then we have no books left
the dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the empire state building for obvious reasons
every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material
being patient at this line could take long time but it could go by fast if you had something to do
in order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain
i realized that i was more happy when i recognized myself and told people the real truth about me
think strongly on the things you do and the way you approach things to get peoples attention
a study made by students at <organization> shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are <num> dropped almost <percent> in people that use computers often
there are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to <location> when you can just look up pictures of <location>
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast
it was difficult for the dirigibles to dock
she said she would walk into their shadows with him
teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family
talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth
another problem would be the violent wind currents
you could be going to new place around the world
being around me makes everyone laugh
they wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due
and you have know left its the right your could and have nothing to do that rude
theres one time though that it meant both
my father handwrites all of his papers
<person> turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack
this shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it
i believe that having a computer can be a very cool thing to have and very useful when you need it
everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too
the only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books
my mom is a sweetheart who always laughs and i can always have fun with
there are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life
the downside to listening to music is that you cant exactly hear everything that great
we laugh about anything <caps> everything that is even slightly funny
the builders of the empire state building faced a multitude of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the first group was done <num> minutes
they also appeal to a lot of people across the world
the mood in this memoir i believe is appreciation and caring towards others
then from across the room it came
which helped him dehydrate faster
this pinpoints the mood as well as throughout the excerpt the <caps> speaks about his gratefulness to his parents
censorship on books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing
finally the line was moving forward once more
even at a small age you still can make a difference
there are tons of books in the library that people <month> find offensive to young readers today
finally my question was answered as a nurse said i could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness
our conversation was anything but special
people also make and keep in touch with great friends through the <caps>
typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand eye coordination
so keeping these types of books <month> help other people who are readers
the <caps> of <caps> is one of the most important things in life
unless it is a closely grounded secret
this brings us to our last subject
his friends will call him and hell blow them off until he finishes his game
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
on her <caps> homework
another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills
i have her to thank for getting me through my tough years
if a teen helps with a then they can ask a for help
<caps> the wind would make the dirigible swivel around and around the mooring mast
<percent> of all teenagers like watching music videos
how are we going to encourage people to use computers when their at the risk of getting their <caps> stolen
she can make me laugh in a way a lot of my other friends cant
without laughter my life would be dull and have no color that would make me who i am today
computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends
the heat could have killed him anytime
while constructing the empire state building the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock
they give people chance to chat with people allow them to make friends
all projects require research
we have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries
one of the features was the lack of water
he was saving up his energy and his water
there was no water either
<caps> way the author is grateful is his parents love
readings is something that we cannot get away from
the third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the empire state building
if you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night
my heart broke when i saw him start to cry
emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say
taking the extra <num> minutes to use a textbook wont kill anyone
builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society
you can talk to people the faraway you lose
explicit movies and music are very bad with seeking to understand
the number one obstacle was safety
we were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night
for me reading books helps me escape the real world and catch a break
you have to think of the effects of whats going to happen to the child later in life
thats just a example
i believe that the technology of computers have a positive effect on people
it is their right to do so
it gives you strength when you are weak
i many anymore because they spend all of there <caps> are so many things to do in life that will bring you enjoyment than playing on the a computers
i remember a time when i was patient
the whole car ride was nothing but awkward
i also think that is where most of the stuff kids pick up are from the music they want to listen to its horrible
we laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered
please take this info your next
he is also grateful for his parents love and sacrifice
i told you why i thought they did and how
not one person shares the same hunger of reading material
a lack of exercise and proper body maintenance results
this made it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the building
then grabbed <caps> phone to test it
and people say its one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind to people who need it
well thing kept telling us wait <num> more hour
it made me feel as if i was there
he caught up to her on the grass
hoping that one day soon ill see him again soon
but even though computers cause so many problems we can prevent them by using the computer to help us
these girls knock our confidence down
in the memoir <person> written by <person> the mood is happiness
its offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries
computers practically run todays armed forces
the snow melting would be the pain going away
as the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs
i just laid in <caps> bed longing for <caps> father to come home
libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material
the computer saves us time and money to do these things
it depends on a point of view like most things
the paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent
man has always been interested in technology
first you <caps> meet how people or friends
but love branched out into gratitude and hospitality
we all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not
but then <caps> comes up with this idea to play some video games
researching for a class and making a project
and all of the sudden my grandpa gets the biggest smile on his face and both him and my grandma start cracking up
i personally think that computers are good
so it is absolutely worth the wait
it was not safe and dirigibles are highly flammable
<location> pulls her again and <caps> falls into me
exercise is important <caps> people let that bobby
when i was sitting there they told me they had to get my brackets and wire
because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting
<caps> i bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party
wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea
a time this happened to me was when me and <caps> boyfriend were on our way to <location> and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong
the is <caps> writing
typing on the computer is a lot different from talking in person
then <organization> started poking the <caps>
we were all very different from each other
you can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have
unfortunately i had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves
when she is feeling sad it is if there is nothing in the world that would make her cheer up
<num> out of <num> people have gotten in big trouble through the <caps>
i will get the music and movies i enjoy and find age appropriate
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the reasons as to why dirigible could not dock there were obvious
libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired
i was annoying my mom a lot
then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer
its just part of live there is offensive material every where
finally she reached her point
i lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats
that is my first reason why computers have a positive way on people
me and my sister got permission to leave and go on the riper
<caps> what brings people together
i had no idea that she had cancer
i fear the out come of that
one afternoon my brother <caps> went to pick up some car parts
another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history
some of them causes us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior
my story is the comfort of love
the reason why i would have a low tolerance of the censorship is because different people like different things
they are here for a reason
so that is what i ended up accusing <person> of for at least a month after it happened
the cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going <num> while he is only going <num>
one time when i was patient was when we were flying to <location>
i think all things should not be judged by assumption
the author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story
<caps> was the <date> time and i was about five years old
that is why i think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting
many people have been in a relationship before from excellent to bad they knew <organization> laughing with each other they enjoyed the enjoyment from one another
there are really three main reasons
<caps> first reason is that people waste money on it
like on the quote of the rusted water pump
nothing stands out more beautiful than a human laughing
thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the empire state building
we still pick on her about it and many other things she says out loud with out noticing she says them
sitting in the car waiting for <caps> mom to get out of the house and into the car
yes because what if a <num> year old could find a offensive to have a book that talks about his race in a bad way
it was like <caps> was on laughing gas
the author tries to show the love and affection throughout his home
i got hungry and i was sleepy
company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the <caps> one ever
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project
i had an experience similar to this with my friend
one of the best things they have is the <person>
i think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it
<person> got down from the counter but with no chips in hand
<caps> latter <caps> we went for our walk i asked him about it
computers cause people to be lazy
people interact a thousand times a day on the computers
imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them life would become much harder for the people living on this planet
i saw the limo just as we entered <location>
if exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke
you <month> even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family
yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like hibiscus
just <caps> playing on the computer can be very bad for the environment like it is bad for themselves
people love making other people laugh
a instance of this is i began breaking the ride down into distances
when i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it
com are great for learning
my opinion on this matter is that agree that computer are bad and people are spending
one way is is shown when <caps> mentions his grand parents
i will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home
as you read my letter i hope you fell the same way
we would get information from the books but not as much as we would get from the computer
she is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring
the author created a mood in the memoir
in my head i am thinking that was the longest ride ever
there was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again
moving you fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise
they simply could not drop a large glass and chrome mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof
just like i say earlier thats not good computer usage
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
i was waiting for about an hour and a half
i forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories
you could just put age restrictions on the books
libraries have sections for all ages
<caps> honey but i cant get it now
i will give you some advise
<person> was given another miracle
the doctor came out and said we can see her
there for the wood of the memoir is those two reasons why it is a <caps> mood that the author created
i do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how other think of them
the laughter started to settle
i think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book
they should make the <caps> behind the counter
we where one of the first people there
and started to bandage him up
if kids parents complain then at lest you can say that its all in one room and no kids aloud
every book has a different experience that can help a child learn
in the excerpt the obstacles the <caps> of the empire state building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area
the main reason why i am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends
it gives us thoughts we <month> have never thought about before and they tell us the newest updates
he also is talking about home and how a house can become a home
everyday for the rest of that week i was good
the removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come
people say that computers waste our lives
each and every citizen has the right to read whatever they please to
i think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle
my mom is very patient woman
we started on are trip
<caps> there was a hurricane and the power like birthdays and weddings your computer has a calendar on it that tells you wherever you write something on it
i think it depends on how offensive the material actually is
i feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to
also you can talk to people around the world
i felt like a stupid person but i would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than i did
hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed
these books can also be accessed by children
just as my friend and i were in the car
also it can help you get on ethnic back round to learn about faraway places
well i know i <caps>
computers are testing away people enjoying nature
you wont get bored on the type of games they have
he was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set
if those are removed i do not think that people would care that much
the people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away
all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
<caps> is one of those people who makes you realize that laughter is what unifies us and is something to do
i was so mad but my mom this kept her eyes on the road
at some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me
so we were planning on riding that first
my mom called my grand pa to see what the forecast is
students now easily forget to do homework
sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you cant talk or see them
the computers make researching easier just imagine not having to drag home those gigantic books home or having to constantly find information in them
<caps> that he love them anyways even if it is good or bad
we got our rollerblades on and carefully stood up
there are a lot of advantages to computers
websites that are colorful and fun can teach kids how to multiply and read
it was to far away tho so we waited for it to get closer the boom the rifle goes off
there was and has been a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas
also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it
and become skinny with no worries
still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself
getting more active <month> even bring your friendship or family bond even more closer
when two weeks passed i already had my bags packed and was ready to go
it was pretty scary to me
imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away
your stressed and on edge you have just <num> hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay
knowing i have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym
my mom called called her back and she said she cant make it because she needed an oil change
i think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country
the one you love good past u way and you did not even spend time with he or she
it was the <date> before my senior year
later on in the <time> <organization> was playing in the other room and wanted to show <caps> dad the toy he was playing with
that is a time when it was necessary to have patience and to not complain
censorship in libraries will always be changing
if you were lucky you could find a bit of what you were looking for
i always laugh when i get nervous
they passed on their rich culinary skills and love for cooking in which he is eternally grateful
when i came back i checked on how the other <caps> were doing
the terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain
another big obstacle they faced was nature
this means there was no water available for him
i have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
just about <date> i finally rekindled the flame with my dad again
this affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost
but many people are abusing the <caps> and not <caps> when to get off
many good little ideas to do with family and friends instead of using computer time
movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path
it was the <date> and my friend <person> was going to come home with <caps>
i told my brother thank you and gave him really big hug
all these things make up peoples lives
you can tell by the way she knew what her gift was
the quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored
on top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable
on <date> i understand what my mom was saying to <caps>
and the magazines to keep you updated with the newest fashion on new looks or something thats going on and our community
so then were left with nothing
after a while my parents said <caps> can open our gifts
next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs
everyday i would go to <num> and <num> hour hoping i would be called
this shows the increase in effort in strain the terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure
all in all we would have some fights about where to stop on the way from food or when to turn but nothing too serious
he was exhausted and could not go on without water
one of moms they able you to talk to friends
students do research in libraries for research projects and essays
every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain
if this were done parents minds could be put at rest for the time being
the red paint was chipping all over the truck
so i believe humor is such a marvelous element to have within a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness
it was fantastic <caps> <caps>
thats when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who i am
also it was dangerous for dirigibles that ran on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable
libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone
i think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read
when people use computers they burning fuel which harms our environment
each computer bought has given someone else a new expense
there was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles
at the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him
the buildings frame would have to be strengthened and modified to accommodate the situation
most of the obstacles should have been realized before the mast was even built
the trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there
our teacher also encourage us to use computers
i pulled my camera from my <person> look alike bag and pressed record
most magazines that are being sold today is giving children the wrong idea
these seem to be the kinds of books that young children have become interested in
of course i was crying now because i do not like baby food and to be in a highchair or be put in a diaper
they also play with complete stranger
another main reason is in <caps> <num>
for example make animated movies and video games
i had gotten more information than the book
the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the empire state building
theres less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends
you never know who might need the information
also if kind of surgery on it and that will cause you from doing almost everything with that one hand
patience is waiting for something calmly
it was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing
so no i do not agree with you
now i will explain in further details
but i wont say which one
<person> always been there for us
there were obstacles such as the fact that if a dirigible were tied to the building by a single tether it would add stress to the buildings frame
as a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary
making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane
people use them like they do the words and or the
i want to be that light
well i will tell you what would happen to <caps> all would end appointment would <caps> giving you things you already got
many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read
as we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush
i awoke at the sound of the alarm clock on a sort <person>
the books that were found offensive should not be read at all
i obviously think that censorship is a good thing
in conclusion i learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life
this is many of the reasons some materials should be banned from kids
when parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate
books that are for adults can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store
there is this one joke i made up all by myself to cheer up <caps> friend <location>
another obstacle that came into play was <caps>
when someone something they watch the screen not their hand
it really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with
<caps> is the last time we are coming on <caps> ride
generally this is not the case
going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay
libraries are very interesting in many ways
this could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point
there are ways mentally and physically
the builders of the empire state building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new empire state building to accompany this new means of travel
these things have evolved over the years thanks to computers
we put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it
several parts of this work emphasize this mood
the reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed
the <caps> <caps> family risked everything to help other families
every now and then <caps> i am sad i just go and think of <caps>
his parents gave up their jobs and had to start their lives over entirely
the back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast
as i stand to <caps> feet we both smile and begin to laugh
you can help by teaching them what is right or wrong good or bad
while reading people <month> also reflect on if they lived in a home with people they love around them or a house
the mood created by the author is a warm happy mood
this is what could happen to anyones child if there are books out their that could be harmful to anyone that picks them up
mother nature has its great benefits when your career is all about science
i got my stuff together
i was no better than those people in those movies
the builders had many troubles with the building of the empire state building
laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally
then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch
as my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses
some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and hanging with your friends and family
for example you always thanks your parent when they do something for you
the horizon kept him hopeful and determined
people make decisions
the whole memoir has a loving mood
at the <organization> there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats
after reading my letter i hope you agree with me
the door slammed shut and i went straight to my room
another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks whats going on here
com for instant messaging
laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyones spirits
all the things we have been through make me laugh
it turns out we had a two hour layover in <location>
going on the computer takes away from this time
<caps> is a huge thing to worry about kids all over <location> are on their computer than outside
they should be locked up
i can relate it to a time i was played <num> soccer games during the summer heat
two main obstacles builders faced during construction were safety in nature
as the play was ending the used every minute of it to grow their friendship
it was here where i learned the real definition of family meaning his mood was he felt loved by his family
it was a very fun time
music is an outlet for many people
i mean everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years and years ago
used hydrogen rather than helium
the first problem that the workers faced was that a thousandfoot dirigible
in the end it was time to get my shot
i think censorship has a lot to do with maturity levels
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area
another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether
i said okay and went on eating
studies show they would be more than likely to leave you
show i was ran because it was a hour left
maturity comes with understanding
laughing can really help you get through a tough time
thats why computers are good use
that night was one of the best and funniest nights i have ever had
you can do this through via email
this paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story
the <caps> can help a student pass school
<person> decided to go to the mall to look for a ball gown
i grabbed my purse and ran over to them to give them all hugs
this things are great ways to understand things
the first thing is that the mood is love
take my cousin <person> is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend
another thing it can do is play video games
its clear that computers can do just about anything want than to do
they should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries
<caps> last reason is i know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier
so really why would u take stuff off the shelfs if other people read them
that is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer
as i quickly went thought the order into i was thinking <caps> is will be so am some once i get <caps>
being so happy made this such a warm home in <caps>
they help us in so many ways
we came to the conclusion our <caps> idea would be <caps> <caps>
baby sitters <month> need to do their homework
i feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things
he has asked her about fifty times
safety was clearly the biggest concern
jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face
thats why the technology or computers effects people in a good way
it is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land
the same thing could be said for these materials in the library
he finally came to a shop a drank from the sink
ever since i was born laughter has been a big part of my life without it i would be a very boring and grumpy person
if people are always playing games the computers then when <caps> they go out for a jag
should be removed from the shelves
half way through the <date> are star player got hurt so coach put me in
but i can understand the other side of the issue
the unforeseen safety issues lead to the downfall of the creative use for the building
offensive material could also be learning material
and we never got mad just a little board
on the <date> every one has their own agenda that they fallow
one time when i was patient i got a <organization> last <caps> i asked for a <organization> and my <caps> said maybe
many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles with trying to build a docking station for dirigibles
family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family
all these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly
all of the grandparents loved her too
i had fun at my dads work because i loved playing with my little sister
the story that i will be telling is about how such a bad day for hunting turned into the funniest moments ever
i think the last time i spent some time with my family was about <num> weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit
the setting affected the cyclist performance
this would be true because of <caps> fathers great level of patience
thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores
people who things and world famous people from back then compared to famous people now
or the libraries having books like that
in my experience some music is just too offensive
they had to think about all the people and how close it would be to the building
so when he found out he knew had to make his taller
people who love horror movies probably hate comedies
well thats how they feel when that happens to them
the stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left
libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive
a dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the potential of wrapping around the mooring mast in the unpredictable winds
many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone
that was a funny wordsearch
the setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much
another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature
he is also happy to have a loving home and parents who love and care about him
in better words funny times <month> be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces
one topic that brings me laughter is my niece
i knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside
then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes
plus email is great for work
the author concludes the story in a what seems like incomplete paragraph
the first town he comes to is entirely deserted
the next morning it was hurting <num> times more
the doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a
we thought to ourselves
it really is what brings us together as best friends
my eyes quickly scanned the phones contents and concluded that <caps> was ready with the saran rap at the four way intersection
she lived in a close community were helping hand was always there if needed
on the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing
<caps> could use the computers for <caps> <caps>
they should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area
humanity relies way to much on the computer
these children need to be taught that there is other ways to do things
common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material
id read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate
nor had they remembered the law against airships flying too low over urban areas
one obstacle was they had to make sure that the dirigibles could dock safely
every book cant be perfect for that person
that is why you should have computers all the time
i know that when my library had a series of books that i found interesting that i was back in there after i finished each one
in my opinion computers are very beneficial
we both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up
and i still feel the same way about the music as i do with books
nature is a beautiful thing
hydrogen was more flammable than helium
this made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal
we all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children
there was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
we were heading to our first ski race
one reason i feel this way is that computers can improve handeye coordination and other skills
banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons
it started turning dark and he was still biking
the computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble
the builders of the empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind
i much rather see kids outside playing
i agree with her on that statement
all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey
like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need
in the adult section they have adult books
the builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money
but i still think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say
this was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past
libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world
we went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines
my ideas to me are good ideas and i feel like we can put libraries into good use around this county and <location>
grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half dragged because we were shaking to hard
parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages
another reason was it was very unsafe
<caps> how dangerous the hydrogen could be
<caps> we checked in everyone separated vastly with their groups of friends who they rooming with to checkin to their rooms
i had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me
i left feeling more happy and excited than i have felt in months
theres no more need for driving to the town library and then searching through countless books and encyclopedias
it would make you anxious to read it
but now more and more people think its a waste of time
people always saying kids should read more
authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them
all they have to do is hit a button
the parents would like them to have educational books that will help the kids learn new words and school related stuff
have until she realized a want going to follow her
to the computers people technology is a good thing to have
<person> explained everything to them
a second productive task can help us with is learning
kindly i asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend
i took the chance anyways
the builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome
another obstacle dealt with the mast
ms <person> says the computer game has helped her
we have a live chat on <caps> or even <caps>
<person> talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds
we all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you
many people have dream to one day build a computer or make new programs
computers almost anything possible
censorship is a tough topic to discuss
we both are people that like to laugh a lot and if not we get bored
in my opinion there are some books that i could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons
she stops at a florist shop because she sees a plant that she thinks is like the one she had back home
they have a very positive effect on you
the weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below
you should have an idea of what your picking up
first the hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing
the final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature
we were all reminiscing the good times we had with <person>
during the 1920s dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel
these are the mood created by the <caps> in the memoir
the creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to
and if you just want to stay home all day you can still interact with people
and so i turn around and <caps> tossing the cooler at me
the girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends
of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways
there were too many obstacles for it to succeed
computers just simply are a hassle in <date> world
just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back
<caps> not your job to make my decisions
we scanned the menu for something that sounded appetizing
<caps> walking into a room where people of all are learning about computers are helpful to <caps> individual because the can learn about places
the architects had failed to see many of the potential problems with the mast
well <caps> from all over the world are not getting enough exercise because <money> computers
<person> mumbled under his breath
i moved closer to them so i could hear
the winds the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent wind currents
i was at my boyfriends so lucky me i only had to talk to my mom on the phone about it
i think think the <caps> better can your health
my mom was so patient with her
this safety hazard is one of the builders problems
she was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her
i turn on the <caps> and changed the <caps> to the music <caps> and started to dance as if i were to have ants in my pants
computers are very helpful in many of ways
this variety provides stories for many audiences
but you need to build a strong relationship with your family in order for them to be there for you
when i clicked on it i was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures
i have felt what laughter can do to a relationship and i can say that it most definitely feels good
the next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm
and why would computers stop people from doing that
then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day
safety was a major obstacle smith had to face while building this building
this memoir really sets of mood of love and comfort
in order to have a dirigible dock on the top of the building the building would have to withstand its weight
instantly new laughter erupted from everyone
quietly turning over my shoulder i try to hear more of the story
i had personally forgotten about <person> in the back until <caps> got off at her stop
along with natural hazards it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the empire state building because of an existing law
<caps> the mast was an obstacle they had to face
this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die
you can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school
and how much she loves them
but when it does come to the pornography that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library
most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things
i found some duct tape <caps> the <person> could tape the sleeping bag to the floor
if we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop
throughout their childhood my <caps> and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table
but i also think that everyone could use a little patience
<caps> was holding something behind his back
it is never something we should take for granted
violence in books can influence killing
many features of the setting of the cyclists excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically
<person> and i again would just look at him
so we then decided to sit down one day and talk
there are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad
they help people learn new things
the computer can really amp up your social life
but <person> was right by his side helping him along the way
second remind her of her home
this is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
as he continued following the old mens out dated advice
<caps> i had to just sit there for about half an hour until my name was called
if we make a to spend this than on computers i think we can reduce this obesity amount and i believe <caps> ran as on overall country
these advances in the technology are making us very selfish
another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
in this new house many people came over to eat and he felt good around these people
then days started to go by faster and then my birthday came up i was so happy to finally see <caps> i was getting
and that is why laughter <caps>
they faced many problems when trying to dock there
i went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker
he is the perfect role model
it would be a catastrophe
i think at least <percent> of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising
another thing about computers is they help you in the work place
like for example rap music
it was three years ago in the middle of <date> and we were all sleeping outside under the stars
here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves like sex
my coach is also very huge on people having positive attitudes
computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available
computers help everyone a lot
every single book that is made today has a right to be read
the time i waited for party to happen
he was very determined to get what he wanted
then she called me and said
the time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not
eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired
i mean i love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells
learning new things can only be interesting if you can actually see them
<caps> i sat back down trying to let the line get shorter
this supports the mood of the memoir because the author appreciates the fact that his parents gave up so much to make a better life for him
even excel lets you make graphs and any char t imaginable
if you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook
the mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness
the last obstacle would be the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of helium
or just for fun you can play mind game with other people
but it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view
some books are <caps> for kids to read
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
<caps> was late when we got home so i immediately went to sleep
thank you for taking the time to listen to my opinion and i hope you agree
that is exactly what it did for <organization>
that is why i strongly believe that people spend to much time on computers rather than
a final mood would be happiness
the fate of the mast such as in <caps> <num> says was neither practical nor safe
taking away computers would drastically impact every day life
if there was movie that was made that was racist against <caps> people the government would probably censor it
i agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents <month> find offensive
i should probably start rapping things up
because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives
so please make sure you try to spend time with your family
i already have recognized in believing it my self
this in turn allows us to get more done
we got everything that we needed that night when we went to <organization>
i know that i would try to contact them on the computer
it will also help us learn about new things because we can talk to people and they could give us some ideas on what to learn about
i have a computer at home and i know how much fun it is talking to your friends on <caps> or whatever you talk to your friends are
the biggest obstacle seemed to be safety for the people
music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves
i think that we still need to do that now
<caps> so close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into sharp spires of other buildings in the area
everywhere you look there is always laughter
it could most likely cost you or even family members your lives
she is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop
if more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue
in the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf
but all that time <person> and <person> were talking
like when you get a job or an interview
these are only <num> of the many bountiful things that a computer can do
i just think that spending time with your family is important
having a computer also helps people in need and also inform people about far away places in the the world
that period i laughed the whole time
i firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect
another mood mood that the author creates is happiness
thats how big of an impact <caps> has had
another obstacle was the climate
<caps> dad loved to take us to go lake fishing
some people only read different books
<caps> calls his parents actions of coming to <location> courageous
the man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do
its all media and entertainment
they were scared it was dark
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
when i was young me and my friends would play at <caps> <caps>
communication is positively affected by computers
to be happy you should have laughter
me and my brother started yelling back
but i personally think the entire team did a good job listening
i asked mom when does she think the traffic is going to blow over
this is the mood the author swings into the story
but the good things through my life have been breath taking
i believe things in the nature should be handled in great authority
there were many obstacles the builders went through in trying to dock the dirigibles at the top of the empire state building
laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in
his dad has been their most of his life
when finally they called us down to the basement
books your <caps> teacher assigned <month> not be appropriate for five year olds
so the next time you see something that is offensive just put it back and move on
<caps> is a worst case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all
so i did what my grandma said and the next day a big package came
his name was <person>
we joke around and we make any boring time into a good one
i am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring
there float was for <organization>
there was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back
then we all burst into laughter
my second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying
almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctors or in the hospital
we cheered as we drove off
it is often the ice breaker when i meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends i already have
i actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials
of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a <caps> fire drill around it
lets say i was going to make pizza and i did not know how i would have to look on the computer how to
everyone seemed so much happier then they had been the last few days
<caps> all i wanted to do
part of a parents job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level
i got it all from my dad
in my opinion <caps> brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down
the deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator
so its going to take something else then a materials being removed from a shelf to find a solution to this problem
a drug that runs through the bloodstream of society
let them read for <person> sake
at noon i woke up and ran to the living room
they both could have good ideas and functions to them
that is why we now have air planes
thats when a computer helps
waiting was hand to do but i had to be patience
the people will find out what they want there kids to read and listen and watch and so will they
i cried almost everyday at <organization> with him
you cant cut pictures out of books
he was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted
they never figured out how and the idea just disappeared
the wind is very violent at that altitude
libraries cant please everyone
no one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer
this would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year
my friend <caps> was going to finally give me an answer to my question
everyone cannot be the same it just would not work
you can learn whats in a book just by reading it
everyone is going to be offended some point in their life
books that suggest radical ideas could also belong in the group of books being taken off the shelf
<date> was the day i met him
first of all computer <caps> over ruling family and friends
they would break the law of airships flying to low in urban areas
the obstacles the <caps> of the empire state building faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the safety of the people below
computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored
they modified the buildings frame to accommodate the new situation
she realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring
everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship
the moods started off a bit shaky and very serious
this debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down
thank you for your time
it is the reason you know you have a great bond in your relationship
my final discussion is music
the framework was originally stopped at the eightyfifth floor
she laughed and tell told me one
when i was younger i faced a situation which affected me <caps> i grew up
books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content
i went on about how my dad would not care if i bought this game
they say laughter is the best kind of medicine their is
i gave myself a bat on the back
the winds on top of the empire state building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
she started to crack up and i fell to the ground in a burst of laughter
he just kept laughing
if you have patience that is good for you here is a time where i had patience
i think that was completely handled the wrong way
those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists
if it can help a driver turn his wheel faster or hit his break i think that hand eye coordination could help that driver stay out of an accident
nature added to the problems
the architects could not just put the mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof
its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you
it was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air
studying is also made easier this way
there can be a laughing relationship with animals as well as humans
the cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to <location>
say its not good for you i hope you liked my prompt so it can go in the newspaper
dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in back with lead weights
they are only down by three
no one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song
people say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives
the author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her
life would be very difficult without them
it shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it
i heard a laugh and turned around
then her mom came home <caps> went in the room in change he clothe s her mom said where a going
however the generation under me will soon love them
music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways
that can usually take up a lot of peoples time
second of all computers provide a tremendous amount of entertainment
people can lie and say they are a doctor in their <num> when they are really a <num> year old working at <organization>
the authors battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills
at the end he is looking back at his life as a little kid and how he has improved his life
computers are a good thing to have because you can learn information
these were some of the many obstacles builders faced when attempting to construct a mooring mast on the empire state building
the <caps> had been through a lot in the past seven years
the line to get through
the author describes how everyone would eat together and they often had many more people eating with them
and when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to
many children and even adults are hooked onto the computer
in all that i hope that i made a good point and hope you feel the same way
the mood created by the memoir is shown by many things
the setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist
this is why most jobs have computers
the night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce i called him crying
but two ships did try to land
to help us with tasks or for our personal use
a <organization> is a wondrous gift
he described his parents to be very caring and always put their children before their needs
they got us in as soon as they could but it felt like along time to me
it is a very negative effect
the entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over <num> dollars worth of investment
please use computers to help our everyday routine
it also teaches you how to type fast
to build a mooring mast the cost would be more than sixty thousand dollars
if the ship was tethered to the mast the back of it would constantly swivel around
the parents do nothing because they do not care about their own child
you could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor
for an hour and a half
so my mom was on the computer
thirdly was the issue of it being against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas was also a safety hazard for people
books and encyclopedias are great sources but the computer has so much to offer
computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries
if you are patient things will happen much faster
it is a persons own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so
he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home
certain websites let you access tons of knowledge
i have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases
sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen
think of everything you done when you write a letter
in that way they wont need censorship
if the items are in a public library they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to view them
a third reason why i think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time
the first thing he dose is make you laugh
i believe that censorship in libraries is wrong
one great reason was safety
a public library can but there are mostly adults there
this existing law made it illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the building or just approach it because the area was too low over the city
<caps> book can be given a nasty comment but then again <caps> book can also be given the best comments
everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books
first was they can teach kids bad thing
<caps> the greatest obstacle was nature itself
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
and he was positive and honest
there a lot of things to life and sometimes we do need as much help as we can get
this is how i feel if my child picked up a bad vulnerable book
she still has hope of passing the drivers test
we want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way
another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason
all these things are comfort for some people
<person> went <caps> her room and began <caps> wait patiently for her mom
the heart of the house was the kitchen
this is another reason it was a bad location
the hills he had to cycle also effected him
everyone needs to look at both sides of the story
it will help us out so much for everybody future
so there was several moods in this memoir
the paragraph is symbolic of turning over a new leaf and starting over
i personally detest censorship
the setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood
it allows us to type essays and projects
the problem with this is being lazy
we let ourselves out in cries of joy and cackles
taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it
i think that they should set standards on what they want to have and following those standards on books they buy
its original property was not to be a mooring mast
and that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word
your going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places and or school
they said that the frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to fix the situation
this is because people think different things are offensive so what somebody thinks is offensive it <month> not be to another person
they just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of
the type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and <caps> mood
not all kids like to read romantic or action books
the communication is much easier than talking on the phone
this it the time i waited patiently
that was until the fight were i was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and i
and then when they find out that it wont work they <month> do it to them themselves
the man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another
and when he arrive at the bait shop
winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
well i know it would me if it was are wedding song
be active and stay healthy
it would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle
its definitely a good quality to have
laughter is the most valued gift that can be given
the builders of the empire state building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building
some people ran get in trouble for fooling around on the web
i took in a huge gulp of air and let it out with a sigh
just to have a chance at a new and better life
people can skate for fun and for compaction
he is always saying how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to <location> to create a better life for him
it is just something in our world that we have to live with
this is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy
computers have made a big change to everyday life
they also save important files and precious pictures
waited for her mother <caps> come back
for example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card
in my opinion many people are just following a trend
by me knowing that i am aware of the fact that children are not exercising
breaking the ice with laughter
<caps> is why i think that laughter is really imported in any friendship
the mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood
as a teenager i can say that most of us who like music we love it
it is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last
they did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles
her sister was not as patient as <caps> was waiting
some people would leave because how many people where in there
even what to do and what not to do
i tried it a couple times while he was looking and he would always swat my hand away
it also can have an effect on your eyes in your later life
should be removed for profanity and drugs
i was eating my food when i saw a cute little girl
by the end of the trip she was feeling better so my mom took us to do something fun
these are my three reasons on why i think computers have a positive effect on people
we walk around looking for the ride and more importantly he line
i think that they should have to be of age to get the books in that section
people like their options to be open and at a wide range
my speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively
you have to be burn with patient
this shows that no matter what <caps> will <caps> his parents
i ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones
after i went to church i took pictures with my family and then went to <caps> to take pictures at the <organization> building
it is like a comic relief in life after a r rough message to <caps> heart
taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well
that could make anyone feel uncomfortable
the planning of where these aircrafts to land and refill was not an easy task for the builders
there is the example
it was very cold and l was dressed warm but i was still could
this is the mood that the author created in the memoir
and we felt like it would break
a library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it
but above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation
racism happens in books all the time
many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes
that was some of the obstacles that the workers faced while building the empire state building
first off trying to tie a thousandfoot dirigible to a building by a single tether adds huge stress to the buildings frame
then take a nice walk or stroll in the park
know one can live with out computers
i remember several years ago i attended a <person> <person> and the <caps> <caps> <caps> party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released
we played <caps> and made jokes and laughed a lot more
it made her feel a lot better i know that
it reminded her of her old home
this would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building
i got up and was so excited and nervous to go in front of the crowd and get my award
that book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book
my friend <person> and i have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since
libraries also have some offensive items in them
or do you want interesting news that will keep you newspaper going
my <caps> ended up taking her while my <caps> stayed with us and boarded the plane
i believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need
some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside
if it is cold outside or raining you can still entertain yourself with just a computer
everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right
even some <organization> ill just sit down for two or three hours and just play a game
this is a topic people have been debating for years
the most common thing that people do is laugh
that was one of my best nights ever
<date> was the last day of <caps> experiment and for that i was happy
one reason is that people can chat with one another
other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness
i was patient to go on all the rides
and those are my opinions why
my football team always does one hitting drill once a week
i thought i was pretty lucky sleeping most of the way for we only now had about a half hour till we got to my moms cousins house
when people are on the computer they are not on for very long
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
i think they should be certain magazines in the library
so we put on our blue <organization> ponchos and the kids were playing tag
one obstacle would be a rough terrain
i say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless
the only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring
you can view many types of animals and study them
that was about three years or so ago
that made him even more thirstier
she meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean
i believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive
so i did some homework
while the music was still blasting and even could be heard from all the way upstairs
this affected the cyclist by making him tired
i know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the <num>
on our next lap around we heard a woman yelling
they are also concerned that looking at the screen could be damaging to your eyes
because of these problems the mast could never be used
anything can make someone change and in order to have that chance we should have the freedom to read what ever we would like
my best friend and i share a special bond in which laughing has played a large role in keeping us together
one person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the <location> <organization> <person>
my grandmother shared a memory about when i was <location> learning to read
i told <caps> mom i was not giving up she was coming
the line moved up again
thank you for taking the time to read this
my cousins story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chickflick movie
it makes people think in different ways
there were so many girls trying out that i was nervous for what team i was going to get on or if i even would make a team
they would be able to learn so much more than before
this shows that it is <caps> good for a child to see such offensive things
if someone wants to read it i think they have right to because it is their own choice
i saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class
she wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons
the author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring
thats all i could really ask for
nature is another obstacle because the wind currents on the top of the building kept shifting because of violent air currents
one such way was the setting around him
i mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries
i ran back up the hill a crossed the bridge and tors the nearest store as possible
my first reason is freedom of speech
but most people tend to giggle or smile when uncomfortable too
the setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go
but thats not my case
the fact that many tall spires lined the <location> skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock
my brother turned into <person> and had to go to doctor
patience is very difficult for me
its excruciating imperative for people to use the computer for only <num> or <num> hours a day
all those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading
i then had to be patient
and during training he got hit in the stomach
i flew backwards dropping everything i was carrying
also information for homework or for work and jobs
we finally eat like having and hour in <location>
i asked him what he thought of his job
it is a fact that countries are better allies <caps> their people get along
nothing was going my way and it was ending up a very bad day
the last sentence in the story is significant
computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge
<caps> then i try fixing the ac
computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis
<caps> features of the setting could affect the cyclist
reading is an extremely popular activity
the author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes
these are example of the moods that author created in the memoir
they also allow communication with foreign countries
<person> sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles
meanwhile i was still trying to make at least one good friend
i was patient and i worked through the problem
we were having a blast playing my favorite sport and making jokes
we were back in and crawled through the kitchen
the kind of laugh where a person might be considered crazy for being that happy
after fixing the structure of the building the builders found out the weather had interfered
another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas
and that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race
many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences
one obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building
thats when it clicked to her that <month> be why her mother never let her check the mail
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
on a rainy day the computer can be a great alternative
<caps> wanted to help her but all he was thinking about was his cousin <caps> that <caps> be arriving at his house any moment now
this idea faced many obstacles
but their disregard for rules and customs was contagious
as i was doing <caps> <caps> shot me in the butt
making the empire state building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this happen
we also use the computers for the programs they have
that took about <num> minutes
we just had to new people join the other day and the season is half over
everyone was having fun except for me
i believe that if someone wanted to know more information about something the library or the <caps> should be able to provide it for them
which i really miss her
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes
talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on
i tell him to pick a book and come on
it is plenty of different reason people come to libraries
in a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases
we could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way
most libraries are open to the public
sometimes there is even a snow the experience of being there
my dad and me have a good relationship as well with my mom we get along well and laugh together
there are many reasons movies can be offensive
we trust each other <caps> can share anything with them even our most important secrets
he still tends to show off
another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps
the same thing applies in a store
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
from then on we kept talking and she seemed like a cool person
what is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from
not yet <person> replied with a sound of fear in her voice
one time there was a huge
which came out <date>
the book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity
this is a time i was patient
books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others
the features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder
i am <num> pounds and in the best shape of my life and i even made by schools cheer team
<caps> then said something about how gross it was when he ate
then the cashiers were having trouble with the registers
i had even gotten some pictures too
i think if we think about it we could all be patient
if you like to watch <caps>
laughter is such a marvelous element to have in any relationship
to be patient with someone is very important
he learned that friends and family members are there to love and spend time with
now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content
just remember to laugh its true what they say its healthy for you so make the best of some of the worst days possible
she was depressed and homesick
but my dad helped me
a time when i was patient
this law made it illegal to dock
to a distant and or person
many things were new to her
the only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button
they can have a really good meaning behind it
i say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing
the third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible
in conclusion libraries are very nifty and important to the town or city
when we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait
for example i have <num> younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids
i was happy that we could finally get <caps> clothes
along with sending a letter is the risks that it will not get there
many websites are designed for this reason
i had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation
these are all positive things
laughter is never a bad thing in fact it has been proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits
another is a connection of her past experiences
if a child happen to see cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents got mad that was in the magazine
even though i beat the game exactly thirty two times on every difficulty without any help
she replied the library
honestly the story is better with it too
i was climbing a pole to ring the bell when i slide
and try to find <caps> where you like and come
we had eat three for lunch and went home with <num> fish left
she nodded her head and they got silent again
like it says in paragraph <num>
i just turned my <num> player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine
he is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird
it could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet
while some people <month> think were not wasting our time on the computer
could be weighted down in the back with lead weights because it used open landing fields
did you knew a person should be be outside for at least <num> minutes to get there vitamin <caps>
you have to watch out for magazines too
there was no one around that he could ask for help from
he has thanked them many times
when you can talk to people from around the world
i would say this because there are different help programs or websites that <month> help people in everyday life
i believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others
in my opinion people should use the computers but not a lot
after a long day i went home took a big nap
they would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chromenickel stainless steel
one of the greatest is the freedom of speech
and she always hugs us before we leave
my personal opinion is that i do not think that books should be removed from a shelf even though it <month> offend someone
you also understand about what to do with offensive books
there is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer
these reasons are why i think computers are a big help in our society
well there are many other times i have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my <caps>
talking with others by computers makes the world go round
computers can also be used for research
as you computers have a lot of positive effect on people
even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better
when it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them
i fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the height
this had also happened to many of the other students taking the test
usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends
nature played a key role in this project
when you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book
he is explaining his past
nobody wants to look at something that offends them
no matter what laughing can always put someone in a better mood
when he grandmother comes back then <person> will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again
libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills
he will never forget growing up and living in that house
this made it hard to tie up and keep the aircraft steady for passengers to get off safely
but there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter
that is the mood the author gives off in the memoir
the creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if <caps> were censored
the ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling
but what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous persons autobiography for a school project
the last type of music is some of todays rap
i go on the computer and go on yellow pages
oh good times having pleasant dreams of food and girls
the worst thing of all you were not able to spend time with the family member that you love the most
the test that she failed tested her memory of her home
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past
once a mind is aware of such adult matters they will look at the world completely different
and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road
they also find them in libraries and the more they read the more they want to do because they are influenced very easily
my friends and i laugh at almost anything
the features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride
some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from
<organization> and i look at each other like we just saw a ghost
s he would not be who he is now in days
it prevents freedom of expression
my sister wanted a curling machine she got that to
the cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain
he never gave her an answer
<caps> allows someone to talk to another person using the computer
the rest said at almost the same time
the builders of the empire state building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
the features of the setting affects the cyclist
another obstacle was the weather above the building which was very strong winds and air currents
the author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things
but she said no and that i had to be patience till she was done
i still think about why i laughed that day
things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff
one mood that the author had was happy
just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book
so we had to wait for four months
on my desktop computer at home
the empire state builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
<caps> a slow smile washed over her face
when we arrive at the <caps> the line was bigger then the start of the day
in the mooring mast many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
then my parents called my school to tell them they were picking me up
through this program we cant socialize with as if shes at home and learn about her college experience
and use the computer only when you need to
this made it illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building
the author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and hes grateful for his wonderful and caring parents
this made it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building
this sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for
i can go on the computer and see what we had to do
you can talk or web chat with friends
<caps> one day she was actually very patient
my little sisters and brother are <caps> obnoxious
these are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone
this reminds me of when recently i had a report to do on <person> and all needed was my computer
censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue
cars also have computers put into them
i know someone who has a <caps> and after school all they do is talk to people
so i had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come
i know this because in the story the main character is happy
you want me to write an to my local newspaper about what i think on the effects they give people
how important family and friends are
he quickly reeled it in
this law making it illegal for ship to even approach the area
the builders of the empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there
its not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf the you might think its offensive
that was a time i was patient
she means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time
these books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them
does using a computer mess up your life in some ways i would say no
computer are also great for looking up places
do you see all people computers looking up facts about things as going on the computers learning
i think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like its going to be a new start for herself in the spring
computers can also help you study for a new job and what the requirements are
my mother could not take it anymore
also <percent> of students in my school say that the computer ha s helped them a lot on school projects
censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else
being on the computer can harm even the computer
they came across a vacation to <location> a place just outside traverse city
there was a total <caps> barrier
i think people <month> over react on some things
he became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse
some people who have <organization> <caps> develop cases where their emotions do not show physically
they kept saying on how we should go out in the front lawn and surprise my parents
people have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in <caps>
i think computers work <caps> because it helps people with there own work
but what do you guys think
there are some material that <month> have offense that seems life threatening
the drill is called truck and trailer
a time that i was patient was when i took my first <caps> test this year
when it got published and you read it and you took it offensive
they based their lives on family and happiness inside their home
i believe that music is a way that people express themselves
at the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life
i still until this day am happy i told the joke
people should not take this censorship ability out of hand
that was a time that i was patient
if you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you
lastly i listened to music the rest of the time until they called <caps> name
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
these three reasons are why i feel the <organization> is underappreciated
sitting on front of a screen can your health and also
at times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies
thats <num> letters a year
my friends and i immediately broke into hysterical laughter
then probably on his merry way to his destination
she was my other half
this was the biggest problem
in conclusion the author sets a calm and kind mood by using words and subject matter that i feel are calming
we shortly arrived home and the look on my little brother and sisters face was priceless there mouths open so wide like if they just saw god
there is nothing wrong with that
language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate
people were waiting for their flight to <location>
the setting had a huge affected on the author
as the day went on the more i thought about <caps> friends the more i got frustrated
when the geese get back
thats why you should depend each other like a team
now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to
in most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper
we get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that <caps> had found
the rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy
i am writing about a time when i was patient
sadly <person> and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones
thats almost everyone
he really wanted to go so his family went
<caps> was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and <caps> the man went through after his love died
i think <caps> because you can talk to your friends about
so he apologized and also got the job
dirigibles were not allowed to fly a certain height over urban areas
i slammed <caps> shut once <caps> body had slithered its way free and ran for the door
the geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring
on <date> my friend <caps> and i climbed on the bus headed for <person> at <caps> <caps>
authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future
what is or not offensive to you compared to other varies on both ends
this shows that he has a genuine appreciation for what they did
showing love towards his friends creates a calm loving mood
a lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come
so i think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready then that is when she will take it
in a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please
people are spending way to much time on the computer
in some cases builders of the empire state building faced obstacles such as safety
i had no idea the movie was going to involve scenes like that and i was disgusted that there was no warning
that happened about three more times throughout our two and a half hour practice
i sigh then drag myself down the steps
libraries have no right to censor books
we ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for <caps>
so libraries cant take something off the shelves just because someone <num> it offensive
my brother started whining about it but mom said it was fair because he got to choose last time
all it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf
the whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope
i was nervous because wed never done <time> before
a similar thing to this is instant messaging
he says if i need to type something out ill buy a type writer
we witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to
but <caps> of this will happen if you stay on your computer <num>
some teenagers including me <month> find some of the material they readeven in schoolto be offensive or have a touchy subject
laughing is very important part of my life and this story
the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast
thats one of my reasons
that is why patience is important
the libraries are supposed to make sure your <num> years of age before you check out a rated <caps> movie
there was only <num> minutes of class left and i had <caps> to do
imagine if an <caps> <caps> woman brought her daughter of <num> years into the library to find information about a school project
the sleepy faces returned and the vivid colors had escaped our touch
it makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who i am
that got me thinking
laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other
last but not least the law against airships flying to low over urban areas
instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood relative
i also got some really cool presents
when we walked up to the line we noticed how many people were there
school sites are available for students of some studying or help
there has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently
same thing with movies and magazines
the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in building a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock on
trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
and nothing is better then spending your time outside
computers help people with anything they need
they told me that i needed to be cheered up
a laugh changes <caps> you grow older
it must have been <date> in <date> when <caps> was home <organization> we were building onto our house when the twins came over
that is what i truly think the mood of the story is
the winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story
when we went to the history
all of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come
offensive material to people is like a good book you can read <caps> and learn more about
the plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter
when we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like
she had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change
my story of when i was patient was when me and my family were going to the monster jam
one of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together
it is very unhealthy
books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such
one time i was patient was when i had to get some <caps> done and my mom was on the computer
parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years
people would be even more offended than before in that case
then the <caps> walked out and i got <caps> shots
then we gathered our things and walked to the game
he encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up
we need to have faith in our kids that they will do what <caps> right
but if i would complain a lot i knew i would get in trouble
so eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find <person>
taking lots of deep breathes helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level
a time when i was patient was when i was at school
the architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last
<caps> <caps> not good to be impatient with your family
after a while he started to come outside a lot mostly every day when it was nice
or she would just want <caps> scream
arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse
computers teach us about interesting things like faraway places and people
some people <month> be interested in these topics
with a soft and almost beautiful voice <caps> let a little laugh out
for example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained
if you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer then i doubt you were
all of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship
i inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions
one last thing is that my brother stays true to himself
he portrays it as a closeknit community almost like a family who extended their help to anyone in need
after this point he could not be so care free
as far as music and tapes go no i do not think that those types should be removed
sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient
now hes a international clothing designer
when we finally got on the plane we took the hour long flight to <location>
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
you lose a lot of friendships like this
i laughed so hard i feel over because the look on his face while smiling when he was throwing up
keep playing the some music
that is all i am asking for is for you to stand up and back me up in this war on censorship
the mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented
later <time> i found him and he was big <num>
so <num> hours went by hear they come
<person> started to climb the steps
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
that would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries
so easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem too good to be true
they build cognitive skills and offer a vast wealth of knowledge
when it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone
i have been patiently waiting for it to happen
laughing can make you feel one hundred times better when you are feeling down in the dumps
the cyclists adventure was very much affected by his setting
it was the farthest i have ever been away from where i lived in <location>
the main thing that computers are great for is research
the biggest obstacle was nature itself
i think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer
i think done all i could
all of the sudden <location> appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face
its also good for business men because they count on computers for all there files
the author creates a mood in this memoir
but cant be impatient or you wont get hired for that job
he was the <num> president
rough road ahead are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds
the road change and the heat made him say i could drop from heatstroke
this shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir
all things have a story to tell
the desert setting also affects the cyclist mind
the trip home felt shorter than the trip there but still long
the builders of the empire state building faced many <caps> in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
the buck jumped and ran of
well rap music is based on their past and how their life is
if a child is constantly on the computer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the real world
that paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end
the second example is i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
a person i know that is patient was my old teacher named <person>
but my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun
along with the students in the room
in my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable
they could put in it in the back and whoever wants it and go ask for it
<location> was called to the office
music on the other hand is very important to teens these days
that seems fair enough
i was so excited that all yelled
they can also be used to interact with people far away
i believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger
movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch
the bus smelt good but same lady kept spraying perfume so i had to just sleep and snack on a couple snacks
some of the material in the libraries <date> are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive
there will be nothing left in the store
<caps> surprised me that both of us liked a lot of the same things
i found this the greatest part of the jokes
the setting affects the cyclist because hes in the middle of nowhere with no water
some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that <person> will past the test
it clearly helps the workplace get attention
the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i think all public libraries should have <caps> type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of i
she wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard
they might as well get ahead start on it now
almost immediately i found myself in a better mood
i wrote my name on the board for teacher talk
and for some reason he said got you i said what i was so mad but i was happy when it was over
the solution is certainly not to remove what some find offensive for many people will disagree until eternity
other people might enjoy that book
so the car starts turning the corner and me and <organization> start fake fighting
the cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water
laughter <caps> us <caps> <caps> was the <date> of middle school and the entire music department was going on our <date> field trip
so keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them
whether a book is being read about <person> or the <caps> there is always something influential to be read
another obstacle that the builders faced was nature
except for <person> and i
they say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do
<caps> his mood created by the author in the memoir
another is the changing wind speeds would cause the dirigible to sway in the air
like when he says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting
the <caps> of <organization> by <person> was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time
they want to read about whats going on in <location> and about the hottest trends for seasons
everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them
my friends support there when i needed it guided me through the terrible assignment
<person> went and smoked a cigarette
it would seem like we were sad or depressed all the time
we all went from looking our very best to
but thats not all i would want my adventure to consist of
since laughter saved their relationship for a little while i strongly believe that laughter is an important part of a relationship
the music i am <percent> with it being taken out of the libraries
he feels that this sight is troubling
patience is very important at my house
i think patience is a gift and i enjoy it
the mood created by the author in memoir is happy
i did not want to wait that long for my cookies
i think the computer teaches you handeye coordination
i want you to stay with her and ill see you when i can
for example computer allow people to communicate in seconds
he and i believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with
these three themes set the mood of this memoir
in this one short meeting they had connected on a level that was far from their ages
she could clearly recognize me
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
<caps> reading it i felt that i was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates
there are ways people can avoid seeing them
if a <caps> wants to see a rated <caps> movie or drink a beer that is the parents choice to let that <caps> see that movie not the person running the store
when i was little i was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language
then i got on it took off <num> miles pa hour
instead of sending d letter to someone to invite them to the <caps> you could just email them
the most immense obstacle was mother nature
but there is a main reason
i hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family
<person> and i are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun
learned to be patient when someone takes to long to do nothing
<caps> was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school
then i had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them
at the end of the period i had to pee so bad
it was terrible for yelling at the student when you saw for the first time
it has to be patient too
then my dad was done so my friends asked if we could ride the <caps>
with the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope
so people do have a choice on what should be banned or not but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too
because some people like stuff other people <month> find offensive
the author creates many woods in this memoir
censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions
it helps anyone relax
when the empire state building was faced with <caps> a dirigible docking station they encountered many problems
<caps> what everyone had on there mind or was saying
my mom and dad got a mountain dew
his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people the considered family
with censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book
no history will be know but what is passed down
or <caps> not come back at all
<caps> was extremely controlling
it always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days
my last argument for this is a heads up for the parents
one day <num> months from when i sent the poem in i got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond
our society could continue to greatly advance with the help <money> computers
<caps> was thats <caps> thought
the author says my son bodysurfs
she also misses her family and how they look and dress
its as if it brings happiness and prosperity to my life
children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child
what if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it
they would tell other students rumors about innocent people and how gross and weird they were
with computers you store all and files neatly
movies tell different stories such as life stories
the time that i was patient was not long ago
movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun
also some people need their computers for their jobs
the past <num> years she has taken <person> and i along
an example of the sad mood set the author describes his neighborhood
in history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to <location> to get away from their ruler
so out of no where i began laughing with my friend and laughing different ways and carried on a whole conversation just with laughter
he was excited to know that he knows where hes heading too
he came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building
laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another
this is where censorship comes into play
it was hard for <person> and i to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team
the name of the book is called the <caps> <caps>
one main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time
the bad thing about having any offensive things in libraries <month> not be a smart idea if its <caps> most children get there books
my twisted gut loosened with releaf
many people use this method for jobs
that is why and the geese return
the computer can also be very dangerous in many ways
the thing that we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other
other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by
i told her i was sorry and that i only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids
although dirigibles were a modern form of transportation they were highly dangerous
censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent
it made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in
some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing
overall the mooring mast was not a practical idea
this showed that the family was still <caps> in the country they were in now but before was good too
cause they want to buy every thing in the book
because of this computers can greatly help any community
computers are changing the world throughout everywhere
you can also interact with people far away
there were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction
but before i ate any <caps> him if he would eat some of it with me
this lead to a question of safety for the passengers getting on and off
so it was on leg <num> minutes and <caps> the time we got on the ride and at the top of the hill it was probably a <caps> line
so we all ran to the car
i looked out the window but got bored
this memoirs mood is fairly consistent throughout the whole piece
he makes everything sound really nice with every one crowded in the dinning room to eat
that is why laughter is a important element of out lives
step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy
<caps> and <person> both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling
i also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about
these are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir
i hope you see my point of view
i just played that until i got bored of it then i read some wired adult magazine
it is opening because it says we let anyone we consider family stay over for however long period of time
finally you can also use them for planning
one of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it
the meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader
would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
we were driving to <location>
one of the moods was happiness
people should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer
he possessed eight years of memories made with his mother and many of these memories involved laughter
this is a monumental obstacle because safety and other issues would prohibit the mast from fulfilling its duties
i sat and read magazines why i was waiting she finally came out
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem
so from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood
rocking side to side like a baby in its crib
i have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework
magazines can also be educational
thats why i think its so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable
i am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me
my <caps> school experiences was outstanding
the last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains
some people <month> enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive
patience is being able to wait for something
he will abuse of you or kill you
the mood created by the author was structured around many things
the wildlife also had an impact on him
the hills made him tired and weak
and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers
also the wind currents over one thousand feet high our rapidly changing
they also had to spend <money> to upgrade the framework so it does not put to much strain on the top of the building
so i had to back up the car so she could change behind this big metal thing
laugh often to be happy
it needs to be fixed
these dirigibles in the u
times that you can only have with a best friend
the simple things that make me happy in life bring about laughter
this is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer
when that is all over we play a game of hidnseek
sometimes books can cause things to happen in families
he is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep
<person> was happy with his decision as well
math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out
one law <caps> air crafts from flying too low over urban areas
fouls were being called on me left and right
after i went up to see what number i was i saw that i was the first one to speak
<caps> said and hung up
people hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said
the wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the buildings foundation
there are somethings kids just should not see
people have become addicted to computers
the taller the building gets the stronger the wind current will be the more it adds on the building
whenever someone is upset it is easy to give up
i had been dreading going back to a new school all <date> and the day had arrived
a quote proving this is it was in this house where my parents welcomed other refugees
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
the mood of the author in the memoir is that he is very proud in what his parents have done
we were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines
i know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school
the amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humor
i like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything
<person> <caps> <num> addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology
if we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives
when i was just going away from it
like i said everybody has there own opinion and i stated mine
thats not fair at all
it was so fun until we got to the lines
censorship is a major problem in the <location>
another ride i waited for was the <caps> <caps>
when the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain
so i sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life
this is good depending on how long it takes
we got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early
safety was also an issue
i remember one time in particular
the winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast
in conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard
i would have to say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher should be used no matter the content in it
not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else
the fate of the dirigible had faded out
in the passage the author provided a good mood
he learned the real definition of a family
his neighborhood was united and hardworking
the cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted
<caps> my dad said lets go
you have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping
i think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh
the <caps> movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom
the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay
or how small they are still small
he ended up getting a ticket and the cop was a real idiot
they all have a learning process
the show was worth the wait
so all in all my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts
but when we did start skating we stayed there for about four or five hours
it was a pleasure as always to write to you
studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then
another great effect of people on computers is socializing and having fun
this is whats wrong with todays society
it gives me the feeling that i could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger
this time was good as any
in the break of silence she said
i had a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer
i think its good to have a healthy laughing relationship with your kid
i hope you take my thoughts into consideration
the mood also makes me think of what my mom does for her job
a child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track
the day approached and we woke early to pack our bags and pack the car
sometimes the jokes are really stupid
i cant even count the number of times i have been in a complete laughing fit because of <caps> friend <location>
teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book
i believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some offensive material
you can tell i do not have the greatest hand writing
once again computers have played a part in this too
also you can even play video games on your computer
but it was the best because we all reached that tired state when every little thing was funny
at the <num> pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids
so all i decided to do was wait
it took them about <num> hour for them to get here
so i hope i got the point across that its alright for some things to be offensive towards people
<caps> is expressed by the family gathering a the dinner table more times that not
he knew i was quite tensed so he used to play guitar for me and we sang songs together
we were moving anyway and i knew from the beginning that i would easily have fun and make new friends
the author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic
because without <caps> there would be no happiness or joy in the world
so then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section
they all were trying to get ready for school within an hour
as a student i often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored
sometimes life can feel so cruel
although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries
<caps> as we wanted we bolted out of our seats and into the air read <caps> was over
and probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town
so then he had a time to get cool
a single cable tether to the blimp would not help the stress
the life <person> lived as a child was a paradise in his eyes
books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain
the content has a right to be there
this means dirigibles could <caps> at all
discover how great an impact computers can have on your life with just a click of the mouse
or if the person is eating while being on the computer
why cant they just allow the materials in our libraries
children do not choose their parents
the library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for
its better safe than sorry
that brings us to what happens around <caps> family
in the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them
people could use the computer to learn about anything or everything
everyone is not the same
they are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in
i think that the library is a place where people can go and research information
<caps> my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends
they are my family too
a <organization> i saw <caps> to be true was when i met a girl named <person>
a glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside
computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends
now movies are a lot of fun to watch
there are even systems now that let you say something and <caps> will appear on the screen
so the only person at full
thought the quiet repetition of season upon season
a computer can tell you just about anything you need to know
my third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer
to censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress
once again i had to wait and wait again
computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can
i then asked her to sit with me during <caps>
this greatly reduces parent stay of their children living in a foreign country
i had never in my life heard of anyone named <person> before
for she was leaving early the next morning and we were in love
a lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another
i never thought anything would happen to him
then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents
parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials
the smell of fresh <time> air makes me feel refreshed
next they had to add four wings or shiny aluminum to rise a conical roof for housing the mooring arm
people also look up a lot of stuff that involves school
there are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation
computers are used in many schools to help teach students about new things
because of the weather itself it caused them not to be able to build the mooring mast
well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products
but you wont cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake
for example if you were giving some homework that you had to do on the computer and theres was no way for you to do that project in school
everyone believes in different things
so she is retaking the test
the censorship on the media depends
young children should not be exposed to those things yet
she wants to go take the test again when she is stronger
many <caps> to laughter people always say that laughing can have many benefits
computers are used from leaning or for fun
the biker said i noticed the terrain changing
my mom works the night shift at a well known hardware store
when grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays
such is the knowledge lost from bookburning
we were moving as slow as the plates on the earth were
i <caps> i sure would not
i could hear other people in the room start to snicker
i also through one water balloon and guess what happen it hit her face
laughing has got me so far in life <caps> at <organization>
<organization> is one of the many joys i love to share with people
computer link the world together and greatly advance communication positively
in the meantime i ate lunch with my sister <person>
i felt more at ease with him now and actually thought for the first time that maybe this would be a pretty fun trip
it is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents
he ran out of water not to for into his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in
this is a very difficult topic to argue with
one day there was a little boy named <caps>
rage filled in he to at me
we were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch
with that reply i simply just shrugged and began again
the builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws
the builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof
the first obstacle that the builders of the empire state faced was the lack of suitable landing area
i cant tell you how many times i have used the computer to research
then we rushed as fast as we could to the seen of the crash
the only time that this cyclist found water was when it <num> and tasting of battery acid
i believe that books are too important to throw out just because they <month> contain a few vulgar words or images
people get addicted to the computer
which is a perfect description of some thing that makes you feel warm inside
writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel
the definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time
these are some reason why i think we all need computer
he was determined to make it to the next town
most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
the mood <caps> creates is that where you find the good in a life where there might not be too much good
then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by
but this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world
the sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room
after getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times i realized that i started to have feelings for <caps> boy
a very pregnant <caps> <caps> woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements
most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow
i could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still
the cows walking along the fence line waiting for dinner to go their way
<caps> that is one of the times i was patience
i now know that i enjoy being around someone like me who enjoys to smile and laugh
for conclusion i would say people should stop being lazy on computers and have fun in the world while it lasted
laughter has been a huge part of my life
i <caps> most people would feel bad
some material <month> be inappropriate for younger readers
the last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind
the builders of the empire state building where faced with multiple problems for their idea in for what the building would be used for
on my birthday the whole <caps> gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day i was brought into this world
my first love just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears
she had to get after things from the grocery store
it was kind of noisy too
so whatever people <month> think i believe in one thing and its to let people believe in things they want to believe in
but hunger was taking over
i could smell the sulfur smell wafting from the beaker
i question <person> with a dumbfound look on my face
so the whole group got together and took off on an hour car ride to <location>
we had two classes <caps> lunch together
i would wait forever for you so we continued talking
when you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you cant look anything up for school
this is why the mood of the story is happy
this sight was troubling
it makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that
taking books out of the libraries will not change anything
gets people through tough times and times when you just need a friend
it also benefits society because in a couple years everything will be computers
<caps> you could even read a book too
the first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients
we sat there <num> hours <caps> it seemed like an eternity
all of us looked up at <location>
that is why i think she is the most patient person in the world
i met the person that would later on become <caps> best friend through one of <caps> friends
i was at least <num> minutes away from the place
theres plenty of other stuff to do than play on the computer
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and solves the conflict of her failing her drivers test
there was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the buildings smooth roof
that when we saw each other <caps> was at his funeral
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy thankful mood
we stop each other from doing really stupid things
there are so many websites that make it fast and easy
flicks like <caps> and <caps> use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago
they spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family
search him up on <organization> or <organization>
producers and authors can publish whatever they would like
tools is a better word for these things
those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir
that is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college
<state> and <person> are two state that have more people that go on the computer than any others states
if the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children
the rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist
<organization> <organization> was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life
those were some of the obstacles that were faced
i thought that computers are very helpful
the first and most dominant mood is a sense of family or friendship
so after reading this i hope you understand why my opinion is what it is
these three magazines talk about how to be better in bed
the final obstacle the builders <caps> was the wind
the mood created by the <caps> is friendship and love
i could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here
so the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first town as he calls it in the essay
sometimes websites make lose focus on important thing in life
<caps> i sat up straight and looked at him
this is a time when uncle <organization> is patient
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i think that computers are an important part of a persons life because the information found on a computer is very useful
the help us in many other ways too
the features of the setting is that it is hot and dry
just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them
she one reason why think computers are a positive impact on love and society
let people make there own decisions
problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the united states used hydrogen instead of helium
this restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the empire state building
so found all of my clothes and raced around to get my shoes on the others side of the bed
if i wanted to go to a far away place like <location>
they had to fix the mast skeleton if they wanted to do more
that was the mood of the memoir
many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright
com these websites have all the info on things you need help with
over <percent> of the families in our town own at least one computer
i made lots of friends and i laughed with them
laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure i realized that night
incredible numbers of emails are sent everyday
<caps> said that i could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and <caps> agreed to give me eighty five bucks
the factory even made him more thirsty
living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood
well i am here to explain my beliefs on censorship in the library
in the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other
the reason <caps> i am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today
it can be annoying at times but at least shes not all gloomy or other
they are the future of our country and our world
<caps> creating a link all around the world people can find out information about one another and learn what they are all about
the author of that book and other people who enjoyed it do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves
i had just taken a great sniping position
it gives you a feeling of peace and community
what happen if he was never born he would ever never found out what family means
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the buildings framework
another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly
<num> miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level
thats why his a grateful person
i believe strong friendships and relationships need laughter in them to keep them interesting
all of these obstacles made docking a dirigible here impossible
i woke up and took a shower and eat some food and took a very short walk because my feet were still hurting from yesterday
there are many things that could come off as offensive to any individual
plus it can improve the way people feel about them books
we enjoy every little laughing matter because its something we each treasure and its a bond that we do not want to loose
if that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation
overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible
i strongly disagree with the idea of removing any materials from public shelfs
<caps> my own mother wanted to box me
if the cyclist were biking in the <date> on a cold day in the mid <num> he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke
my cousin goes to <organization> which is pretty close to where i live and where my aunt lives
the largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety and actually mooring the dirigible itself
better take everything away from her
its not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are
i can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because i see it everyday with my younger brother
with the wind changing at a moments notice it can be hard for a ship to land
computers could be people far away friends but how about instead call that friend on
my heart was lifted and my smile brightened
make us feel like we have to go out and try it
the last reason why computers benefit our society is <caps>
the mood the author was in made me realize that i need to appreciate what i got
we loaded the trike and quads in the back of the truck and trailer and was off to the woods
the author was <caps> likely describing his happy <caps>
existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
just as we all have choices
it comforts me knowing everyone is happy
helping people is very important in this day an age
and they both lived happily ever after
computers have made socialize long easer
<person> remembers his child hood fondly in his memoir about his home in new jersey
so i waited a few more minutes to ask again
when my family and my mom boy friend when on vacation to <organization>
i think that people are smart enough to make their decisions on what they want to read
those things make her feel welcome and feeling that way will help her with her test
i ask her and she said no because once again she spend her money no paying people back from them helping her out like any dad
one obstacle the architects faced was the buildings frame
it would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a different high school than we did
laughter makes you forget your worries and problems
she ended up flying off right away
the features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town
she wont give up but try again later on in the year
he reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he cant believe how they did it
computers are good and everyone should have one
the term <caps> judge a book by its cover is true sometimes
some people still say its not enough
the only thing that i believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos
this is all because of these <organization> computers <caps> <caps> now can go to any website do anything on that website
but being sick from the computer is gross
the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
this probably happens after a hard day at school or work you can come home use the computer to play some music and relax
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
her mother forgot and <person> read that book
like computers sometimes keep kids out of the street so they wont get in trouble
books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people
i believe that computers have a negative effect
the first problem to over come was the stress a thousand foot long dirigible would add to the buildings frame
there are many opinions on censorship in libraries
some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant
this is why the mood is happy
everyone has different point of view
i think that patience is very good to have
navy tried to tie up next to the mastbefore a law was passed not allowing aircraft the fly so lowbut the wind may their efforts futile
when he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned
according to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him
so even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive
these problems are the reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the empire state building
in the story winter hibiscus written by <caps> ho
all of these were major obstacles to the building process of the empire state building and its mooring mast for docking dirigibles
and those are some reasons how the <caps> set a mood in the blueprints of our lives
the author shows it by saying love of cooking
i fell to the floor laughing my head off
you would censor a school book if it had <caps> graphic text between its covers
where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible
as the effect of that the cyclist had to drink a lot of water
hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday
litter kids would be like <percent> use <caps> to interact with some friends
there is much to be learned in the way of psychology and human nature from almost any writing
but do you see that every day in this generation not at all
we started to settle down once we were in the room
we had the most fun that human beings were capable of
we went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait
any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians
we all laughed and had a great time that <date> <time>
also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise
it will be so much fun
in this paragraph he just gives an overall warm and inviting mood
every human mind desires the freedom to choose
banning books has been a huge problem in todays society and needs to be stopped
laughter is a part of us either we like it or not its always going to be with us no matter what
one time i was wondering what people from <location> did to live and survive
with the recent earthquakes in <location> and <location>
i think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right
all of those things make work easier
computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date
my computer helps me
the most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries
the second main obstacle the builders were faced with was nature itself
the help to thing happen but if done on real life could faster of they also help to electronically than a
lets get out of here
laughter is an integral element to many situations
no one should say anything
we are living in <location>
he liked i and let it go
for the people on the ground
hope you get something out of what i wrote
another reason was safety
another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers
computers are useful for adults as well
and i could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to
i felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day
so far my patience we got ice cream
so i think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad chose for this
one big problem they faced was the wind
the empire state building realized how much worst that accident could have been
a time when i was patient was just yesterday
after i thought about it i never want to do that again
some music has bad language in it and children should not be listening to music like that
thats obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock
the book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is being changed
this is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up
such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals
a computer is one of the most important things in the average home
its interesting how these things just slide by the library
through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense
i was actually standing in line doing nothing
dirigibles could not more at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
it makes me happy when i laugh and brightens my day when i am anger
it is also said thats laughter is the greatest medicine
we should have rights to take off books on the children side
libraries should not censor the materials they display
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it
all of the homes warmth and comfort was crammed into a threeroom apartment
we are laughing all the time
she sat down and looked up hundred <organization> schools
the plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the empire state building
these are simple and save lots of time
we talked about fake teeth for about an hour
our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons
the creation of <caps> created a new revolution of way of communicating <caps> <person> a young student of <organization>
people who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently
after the first couple of minutes we talked we both knew something good was going to come from this
a time when i was patient was when me and my cousin family went <location> and my sister was sick
i believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines
one of the memories is the kitchen
she had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic
many people <month> not agree but i just tried to make people to see my point of this statement
finally a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something
after we found the shoe we realized two hours went by
so computers are a good thing and a bad thing
my mom and i have a great relationship
then it took half an hour to find a place to park
i will never forget that day and all the times we laughed together
typing is faster then handwriting in some cases and papers can be saved electronically
to build this <caps> the architects would have to break laws or bend rules
you cant tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf
the strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect
it also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down
with a computer you can also learn about places all over the <location> and the world
a second reason <caps> worry shout over usage of computers relates to the first reason
everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book
this means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills
i was so hungry i could eat a pig
a time i was patience was one time we were <caps> the store and i was <caps> excited to go to the toys section
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
this is something you can not change
the three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer
he would have us going around in circles at about <num> mph
i was patient for those nine days of waiting
when constructing the idea of dirigibles a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building to allow passengers on and off
my second reason is when people have nothing to do
i had to be patient and take my time
some people even on them to stay in touch with family or at war
then i had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me
when she want to the greenhouse all of the
these books need to be away so kids wont read offensive things or trying to them
the person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not
laughter brought us together in a time of need
all around the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it
my mom also thanked <person> and i for being so patient
these three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage
in the <location> country they speak <caps> and <location> and culture is slightly different form the rest of <location>
this gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence
its the most pathetic thing i have ever seen
no little kid should be looking at or saying those things
my mom also uses the computer to go on <caps>
i believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases
i cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public
with entertainment it is hard to please everyone
in conclusion i believe that is we are bad for society
the architects had engineers and such working on it
these things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also
he finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again
its not okay for a child to talk offensively like that
computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know
people can send horrible messages to someone
i think them repeatedly
together we make the <caps> of the worst situations and move on from them
even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff
this way information is never censored completely
computers is one of mans greatest accomplishments
without computers we would have to do it old fashion style
thats where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands
they might of healthy
the train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop
i do not believe that is very offensive at all
as he begins to see how hope
i showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place
throughout this memoir a very important mood is portrayed and that is thankfulness
all of a sudden i had to use the bathroom really bad
if it has a good message to send to you will think about it
or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read
life is a serious matter that should be taken into consideration
he was filled with enjoyment as he watched his only daughter do what she did best
the author in the memoir tried to create a specific mood
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
the mood of this memoir is good
schools now do program called <caps> <num>
if you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf
i told her i was wrong about a lot of the things that came out of my mouth
it is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them
me and <person> shared a room with her parents
we all sat there in silence staring at her
this shows the effect the exposure to heat had on <num> cyclist
these offensive materials are included in this right
with the computer you can access multiple sites
you use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc
the mooring mast seems like a great idea
the doctor took to long and i was patient and i was patient for the doctor to come back to the room
other than things that people <month> find offensive
the plan never followed through for a few reasons
one of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other
everyone started laughing as well as myself
i helped me realize the effect you have on people
<caps> might actually have famous people accounts
replied my <caps> in a stern voice
he cant say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none
this is because the winds at the top of the building was constantly shifting and the back of the airship would swivel around
while still being patient
if a book is offensive thats not a reason to take it off the shelves we watch movies in school today showing the past when <location> had slaves
my mom and i remember this day as a time we got to bond
the winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around and lead weights could not be used because of the dangers of them falling
they also showed him the value of being selfless for someone you love
finally computers help us get our news foster
he also describes how good his neighborhood was and how they were a close knit community
i was patient because i was done early and a lot of people were not done yet
but its going to keep going on until someone speaks up
one day in the park a boy walked up to me
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning
this meant that the frame would have to be modified and strengthened
this is where mine and <person> adventure started
it connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are
computers also broadcast news
laughing is the key to our happiness its what made me and her closer its a main key point to any relationship
<caps> this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do
little children are the ones who laugh more often
well the children will learn from those video games and movies
i waved to him across the room and he saw me
as like movies though they are there to provide entertainment
i say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
<person> had always been the patient twin in fact that <caps> everyone called her
parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things
it was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in
everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else
computers do not effect me in a horrible way because it helps me get my work done faster
my dad and i were laughing so hard i almost peed myself
also the workers needed to figure out a way to safely get the passengers on and off the aircraft while the tail was whipping around in the air
if they did decide to remove these books are kids would have a hard time learning about the truth
people say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike
the truth about me was that i was diagnosed with gender identity disorder
they had left their whole family behind
i heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop
my second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people
for ant book you can find some bad thing about it
also it says that they came selflessly as many immigrants do to give there children a better life
the bad part was that it was about <num> hours away
<person> and i joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks
one obstacle in which builders would face is safety
the first mood that is shown is a loving mood
all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
in a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive
and all this takes patience
dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge
people need technology for a lot of thin have technology to us
i would be surprised if one does not
that meant no attempt could ever succeed
we drove up and parked next to the rink
thats what gives the world its varieties
<person> of laughter once upon a time there once lived a girl named <person>
planes were also becoming more popular
this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor
the statement in the excerpt says this law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building
we now have one more state to go through and then were in <location>
the <caps> <caps> brought over some dog to be rescued <caps> saw all six dogs second one i saw i knew he was going to be mine
my first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily
i think patience is a time when you have to be calm
he also makes it clear how he is proud and how he greatly respects his parents for the great things they did to improve his life
the flock of <caps> geese represented her changes
air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky
the freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world
it would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it
i said things that were unnecessary and horrible
<caps> friend <person> decided he would go with me
<caps> asked with curiosity <caps>
i told i wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what is happening
i came up and grabbed my envelope
there is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface
censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created
maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf
j finally learned to be patient
being made fun of hurts
this would eventually remove our freedom
to reject leaves you no smarter
the library is a place for people of all ages
beads of sweat formed on my forehead
one out of every <num> teens spends more time telling people on the computer then face to face
i recently had visited a library and some of the things i read in my time being there was really overwhelming
children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible
<person> was her name and she drove a bright orange <organization>
the second reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his home
one of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research
try to memorize the schedule
because you would spend so much time on the computers
ill admit though that i cant help but flirt with him a lot
on my way i could smell the sweet aroma of eggs and hash browns that made my mouth water
our principle called for an emergency assembly when we all had arrived at <organization> that <time>
its already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these bad words or graphic content
people from all over the world have many different opinions
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
<person> grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like
<caps> is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take
this makes them curious
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
every now and then you come across a book that changes your life
the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it
the boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them
in this i will tell you how the cyclist was being effected
imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay
with knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better
i had a same class with him and i was his partner
that was when i realized that we were best friends
her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore
it also where he talks about how the memory of his home having the congregation of family and friends as the back drop of their warm home
here are some of the examples that i can think of just off of the top of my head
sometimes those changes are good sometimes they are bad
various obstacles came up in this excerpt
i loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter
the computer does help with the educational needs <organization> students in <location>
its also takes you away from family and friends
but it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who <month> wish to educate themselves on the said matters
what some people might find offensive others will find interesting
there are no friendships or communication with other countries
<percent> of <caps> in the <caps>
these obstacles and dangers suggest the mooring mast is a bad idea
being patient is a good thing to have
on the computer there are many ways you can communicate with other people
so thats all i have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because there offensive to them
that has been taken out of your local library
so i ran up stairs to tell my brothers what i saw
i looked <caps> the stairs leading to <caps> avenue
these are sometimes when i had to be patience
all of these tiresome commercials
kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time
the books are put there for people to read not just to look at
did you know that nine out of ten people who use a computer have improved hand eye coordination
while in present day less than <percent> of all children get at least one hour of time outside
i told my mom that i needed a new phone
when he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad
she is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower
one day when i was at my sisters football game
two boys and two girls rushed over and settled down next to me laughing at one another for not getting a seat next to me
so you should always have patiences
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
i was so hurt i told him i just wanted to be alone and he understood
the blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below
some people say that the <organization> can <caps> kids like me want to miss out on some qualitytime with <caps> family
the weather can effect if it is rain or weather the road are messed up he could get a flat
except their computers
i look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another
computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family
if that happens smaller amounts of people will come
as citizens of the <location> we can not let this happen to our great nation
it is astounding what you could learn from just hopping on a computer
the mood created by the author is happy and warm tone
another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends
lets just say my living room was a cheese fest
all he did was sit and play games like <caps> wars or <caps>
i felt a little tingle in my head saying your mom is still following you so i turned around and she was not there
it means that she will overcome all that and move on
that proves handeye coordination
i remember him telling me that its harder frown than it is to smile
this is why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test
the dirigible would not be able to stay steady for docking or unloading
we should not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our faces
the plant blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother
my cousins are getting bigger and bigger
at her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories
these books that are considered offensive to some people <month> not be offensive to others
this indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance
they are the ones that get us through each day with a smile
wind was another obstacle that the builders had to overcome
teachers also use computers to look up information on a certain subject
<date> was my best option for a date since i was getting close to her and i was starting to get attached to her
from the <caps> regime of <location> to the banning of <caps> in the <caps> empire
they are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get
i jumped out of bed woke my sister up and ran into my parents room to wake them up
it should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not
there would be no use to have radios
the mood in this memoir is gratefulness
everyone in life needs to be determined
everyone has <caps> <caps> <caps> is true that everyone has their own <caps> and their likes and dislikes
i mean loud as loud can be
i said no because the line was to long
so when we did hang out it was always so much fun
in conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist
and the future but we have laughter that always helps us stay together no matter what happens in life
everyone has a place were that feel like they belong
the law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas
censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something
i myself have learned <caps> to become a successful <caps> novel <caps> from the <caps> i took out of a <caps> <caps> <caps> for <caps>
i believe computers are very useful to everyone
another obstacle was nature
another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments
the teaching on the way people coming i
there is concern about how much paper we lose every year
the plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now
when you laugh you are having fun
one feature would be the terrain around him
but then he got his computer
some families even eat dinner at the computer
this quote show the love and warmth of everyone in the family and how a house can bring people together
a third reason is nature
my legs refused to walk as they shuddered violently
the setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist
i could not do my <organization> events for science so i got a <num> on it
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
finally <num> hours passed and we made it to <location>
the lack of the landing area
this made it impossible to dock
they came selflessly as many immigrants do to give their children a better life
in the follow paragraphs i will continue to support more of my answer
one of the difficult obstacles the builders went through is that the winds on top of the building were always shifting
the whole time we were going to the bath room me and <caps> were just laughing so hard
the builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea
this is why i think the mood of this memoir was warm
but i also learned to be responsible with it
<person> play <caps> describes him in very crude ways
the accusation appalled me and deflated my pride
so computers have a positive effect on people
school could be a lot more difficult without a website
also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds
a persons beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion
even if its one of the most embarrassing events to happen to you in your life time
some offensive things are part of <caps> and shows how things progressed from back then to now
the setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing
in addition the computer benefits students very well
libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public
you should check the rating of the movie that you are checking out of the library or if you are watching it at home or any other places
it is required at almost every job application and at school and every thing in between
these are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful
this law also makes it illegal for the blimp to dock on to the building
movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way
the only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers
books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately
i know patients is the key to deer hunting so i will just have to wait
thats my example of patience
that is exactly what he does
this are my three ideas to the news paper article
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
were made it so your basically always within minutes of a teacher
when i was about <num> years of age i had my first memory
so i went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there
children wont know how to cope with the harsh realities of the world unless they are exposed to them early
we learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books
i wanted my party to come sooner
its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated
we all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries
there are three reasons why they should have censorship
computer help the environment too
i trow skittles at birds and old people
the thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around
in conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything
so there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools
the mood of the memoir is happy because of their close friendships
the main mood in this memoir however is gratitude
children see it outside of school and stay away from it then so they can stay away from it in school also
the greatest obstacle was nature itself
and no matter if your poor or have a small house family is always there
both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast
whats more is that they can be in the bedroom or room
you can also learn about interesting facts or places
something that someone might find offensive might be interesting to someone else or they might have to do an report or project on it
if you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it
the winds on top of the building is always changing
as though <person> and i could read each others minds we jumped on the counter and started doing the run way model walk
then their going to go tell there friends what they heard because they think its cool then all kinds of kids are hearing it
the second was that the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe
starting up for the <num> time that year
all of us where laughing
some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model
in this country we can
she was pregnant with her second child
finally <date> we got there
that is what i think the author tried to create in the memoir
young children most of the time are not even interested in going to those kinds of books anyway
they make our lives easier with their technology
removing movies and magazines that contain pointless offensive material from the shelves could be a good thing
because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have
it was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger
for some reason i started to laugh
they can provide tons of information normally unobtainable
but in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and good thoughts
and i know other people like to do that too
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found a flower that reminds her of homeland
in this narrative essay i will write about <num> different times when i was out had to be patient
but movies show you how bad things are shown
one example is <location>
builders of the empire state building never achieved their goal
one time my friend <person> was at my house and we were playing halo
some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way
com and purchase their tickets
people depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know
computer can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you
i would tell my brother all the time about her
so i think that it is a wast of paper
if your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances
we always have conversations to talk and laugh about
they were a very caring family
this would reduce the amount of people using computers and change the way <caps> see our civilization today
one of my favorite things to do is laugh and i will most likely laugh at anything some one says
i use the computer for mostly everything i do
that candy could have been the guest favorite
another problem the workers faced is they would have to change the entire design of the building to meet the accommodations of the mooring dock
now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family
the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
you are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure
being able to laugh creates bonds that are simply not possible without laughter
people have come to rely too heavily on computers
exactly like what i experienced
learning is a good thing for adults an children
we were waiting patiently for the doer to come closer
i am patient waiting to lunch
because we had to go to <location> city to pick something up and it took about <num> <num> minutes
<caps> said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it
the knowledge contained within them unknown
ya not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff
<caps> the <caps> played it
i do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because onehundred percent unacceptable
he had great memories of the kitchen smelling good
there are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who cant
that is if it will open
the use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important
another way they portrayed this mood is by <person> stating there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity
i believe they should set a timer on how long they are on the computer
all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
i believe in both in a way
she wants to retake the test
i find them very fascinating and i love to see what my life could be like <date> if the outcomes of those <caps> would have been different
another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph <num>
one person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual
let man choose what is intolerable to him
there is this one time that i will always have locked away in the back of my mind
for example same good exercise
it can be shipped to your door without going anywhere
an obstacle that stopped the use of the mooring mast was the wind
after you read my letter i hope you will agree with me
this problem was solve by <money> redesign of the empire state building frame
i think that organizing the books in a different way would be better
teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books
we should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed
these are all the reasons why be should banned these things from our children
the cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured
her parents would never let her read the <organization> books by <person>
the mood created by the author was a warm and comforting feeling
then i will take that test again
they blame them for thing the forget to <caps>
by ridding ourselves of offensive media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful <caps>
when either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off
one of my favorite funny memories is the time me <person> two of my friends went to <location> <person> stopped at <organization> <organization>
writers compose for all sorts of people
the architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof
i understand if everybody thought it was really offensive to take it off but not just one person
so i wanted to do <caps>
this could potentially lead to the buildings collapse is due to the strain
<caps> only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside
the government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in <caps> <num>
he called it the cliffs
<caps> is where about half of the libraries money is being made
in this world you never know what someone might writing
when i was going to the doctor i had to be patient i went there because my auntie driveway had a crack
the computers intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and handeye coordination that could save lives
along with the hibiscus it also shows that the geese and the melting of the snow represent a fresh start and a new beginning
i really needed a friend that could just let me forget about my problems and bring a smile to my face
the mooring mast by <organization> outlines the problems architects had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building
i had eliminated everyone except for one
he said in paragraph <num> that i will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice
yesterday i went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand
i am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised
can <num> we headed off
the builders of the empire state building had various problems to <caps> in allowing dirigibles to dock there
it was worth the wait
they have lots of websites for games
with all these computers many social networking sites are born
there were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building
all these reasons will lead to the <num> below
the narrator is explaining what courage it took for his parents to make such an adjustment for the sake of his own happiness
people love them and use them all the time
computers can find every answer to your questions
so far there has not been much progress in the lists so i would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article
censorship does need to occur in our libraries and i believe it should happen soon
later the night we were with all my family cutting my nieces cake and me and my dad were not talking
after that i went to go in
if the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the <caps> and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items
rec means i was in the best division possible you could be in
she would take forever to get done cooking
one time i was patient was at my dad house
then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about
today i am going to convince you and society that computers are not as much as on issue as some people say they are
the answer is yes they should be different
children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do
my <location> is somewhat of a <caps> of awkwardness
the third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
it is the removal of choice from <caps> lives
some <month> even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it
this is a time i was patient
very much unlike previous encounters with kids at school
others tend to choose not to do their homework and work on their social life on the computer instead
but if your were to take away ever book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world
then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience
it was a no color <person> that was about a police official and his son
let readers have their freedom
so many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions
the third problem was the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation
once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches
the setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist
<person> youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most
its a win win situation
<caps> was very mad at his brother because <caps> was never like this to him
obesity is a huge problem in <location>
it was finally time to deliver her
the mood the author creates in this memoir is gratitude
now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants
if ships had tethered to the building than they would have been doing so illegally
we were all laughing so hard
he really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill
the author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir
if a teacher gives this book to a <num> grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it
they should be things wait to see it
they might get mad and not want to be with you
it would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end
one way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out
it takes you through the woods and over or even through the river
i was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team
instead of writing the word out
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
next day i walked in to school and i could see that everyone was looking at me
he just sat quietly while every one was yelling
books are sorted according to what appeals to what age
the setting was effecting his mood
a common interest brought them together before i knew it
<caps> going to be going through <caps>
one night i felt so out of it
there were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there one obstacle was the wind
i have learned <caps> to deal with all of those things from books
the second bad things is viruses
the steel frame of the empire state building would also have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
by then i was starting to get bored
i got off and rode it miles cum force and i was faced to it
this world is harsh and not easy at all times
my mom had made a deal with me
more people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest
i think we all can agree with <caps>
another obstacle that was faced was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
we out the door and <caps> was pitch dark
this is the mood that was conveyed by the author in the memoir
it was <date> and i could see the snow pouring down as i drank hot chocolate
i knew she would hate this book
friends were hard to come by in my childhood
the plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus
the author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there
if someone took the time to go out and write and book and make sure that everything about <caps> is correct then why should we stop them from letting people read <caps>
this proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise
this benefits people in a positive way
the computer is a very important piece of technology
the back of the ship with swivel around the mooring mast while it was tethered
another reason why is that a school project or essay
usually its cool because you could learn things your teacher never new
there for they cannot blame the place the material was at
libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people
computers are not a benefit to society
by then many more people had shown up
i had been hyper pretty much all day and so had <caps> else
by the late 1930s the idea had quietly disappeared
the first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building
it was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty
the first thing i have to say about this topic is that these items should not just be taken off the shelves and thrown away
instead they sit and play games on a computer
the economy is bad enough the way it is
a year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog
it was fun but it moved a lot so it reminded me of what <person> and i were talking about that how funny would it be if we fell out
we left the gas station and continued to my moms work
appraise the computer
after they had first moved to the <location> they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play
laughter is the shortest distance between two people
laughter is some times in me
that probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination
we each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy
materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content
i made it to the bus stop early
computers are making this happen
i think it should be open but not just anyone
i am not patient at all
i told her it was my juice
laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day
after i got to the top
full with all different ages of players
in doing this <caps> will connect to other ways of life
before she stops fighting for her life
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
all you need to do is be patient
she sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before
it has gone from just being able to go to school to the <caps> various ways to increase your intelligence on the computer
the cyclists attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not
as you can see i need my computer for many things
it should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was not going to work
and before i knew it i was braiding just as well as her
they can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong
in their neighborhood all the races were together in unity despite the customs else where
turns out i was in to much of a hurry
because he was patient
which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test
she was feeling the same way
still not even close to being there turn
they are not patient
there are two reasons why i think patience is important
there will definitely be some people like that
i mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing
when i am studying i like to listen to music
which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources
this statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do
that <caps> why i think computers benefits our society
they help us with our vacation trips
the mood in the memoir is also touching
the builders of the empire state building had obstacles in their way
computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life
she exclaimed and smiled kindly
in the next paragraph i will talk about magazines
<caps> was the first time she has ever said she loves me
he ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike
its was <num> at night already people were already showing up
the water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength
another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode
the laughter which we shared that <time> washed the disappointment far from both our minds
not all games have to be like <caps> of <caps> or <caps> of <caps> they can be games about sports
only people over <num> would be let in and you would have to an i
the computer is also handy when you are going on vacation
the present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same
i waited five minutes and then poured it in
not something that you are going to want to explain to your child
thats the time i was patient <caps> two hours
we laughed about that for the rest of the year
another obstacle was safety precautions
that all changed when my mother discovered <location>
also sometimes its a little dangerous to put your last name
it <month> not be the best choice because movies rated <caps> let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of <num>
the computers are children from a better education
<person> was in my <caps> two class the year before and i thought that i would say hi to him
tryouts we over i patiently waited for the <caps> to hand out the envelopes to all <num> girls
the things that remind her of home
it has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people
some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure
if anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the <caps> and leave our libraries alone
this is why the author concluded that way
i cant remember their names
all requires patience
love and <caps> is expressed all throughout this memoir and i stated just a few examples of it
so as we are both laughing hysterically we are trying to tell him
it makes people so happy and wanting more
i was very happy when we went and i saw how beautiful <location> is
computers have of folders and programs to store information you need
to allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building
the sound of the blinker even brings some memories too
i believe censorship is wrong
to go and learn what you already know
all i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans
these are reason why the society should take back the computer
i hung my head that smoky blues tune summertime rattle around
that shows the fall of man
in conclusion all i say is that without computers in this world
so with the computer computer
it was here where i learned the real definition of family
well i do not believe it is a good technology in our generation
i would hate for some little <num> year old or <num> year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life
well it all lead back to money
you need to laugh to to be happy
so i start running down the stairs as fast as i could knowing my two <num> year old brothers were coming
i started to make a lot of friends which it became a way for me to be a class leader
another example is in paragraph <num> it says it was here i learned the real definition of family
in conclusion i strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf
some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy
censorship should not be used in libraries
another example would be the time i went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems
this is why the mood of the memoir is happiness
they teach handeye coordination
the power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer
that means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate
thats <caps> sets this place apart from the others
studies show that playing a high action game <num> hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating <num> serving carrots a day
for example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water
him or herself expressing what it was like but then when something like that happened to them
society will only cheat itself of the worlds splendor while watching it on screen
my sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups
i was determine to wait <caps> see if my hero would ever reply
the jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started
the <caps> reason that i think computers people to learn about new
such as the danger of the nonu
so he waited for <num> minutes for the experiment to get done
<person> <location> that if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf
the people in front of us was a nerdy couple who had no life
there can also be language that the kids should not read
we only bad one week left to wait to go
the effects computers have on people are only negative
then there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
these books are extremely good
little did <person> know that only the left door opens
waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail
the only eventful thing that happened on the way up was that one of my friends dropped his water bottle and had to chase it halfway down the mountain
the planet should be explored not surfed in the web
so i think that this is a good way to talk to them
another time i was patient was when broke my arm
i also will explain its key element in part of the world
censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights
and for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and i
and go on the computer
that is when my <caps> just started cracking up laughing hysterically at me
even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects
however its often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on its shelves
he looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football
he does this by saying i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
i can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf
three days before the trip to cedar point can not wait for it to be here
reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say
as you can see the mood of the story is warm and tells us about how he had a good childhood
this was a touching story of how this boy appreciates his family and parents so much
the trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different
as the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles
they start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are
there was an existing law against air ships flying to low over urban areas
when young teens see violence on the computer <month> think its cool
the library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want
this show that the flower help her feel better show that she will do it again
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways
which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist
censorship is a tricky concept
in the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private
its comfortable because as i read the memoir it made me think of my own home life
so the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance
thats when we got up and start walking around talking
we had long conversations that would last us hours at a time and we always seemed to laugh about everything
i then said something really mean about someone she knew and did not know it
people <month> use it for research or something in the future
and that goes for about <percent> in <location>
a time when i was patient was when i was at my dads office
this shows that if you are truly patient only good thing can come
<caps> was so big you had to take <num> flights of staying to get to <caps> but after i went back i knew <caps> worth the wait
<caps> is one of the most important tools a person <caps> have
also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically
laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable
we got lots of yummy stuff to make
second of all it also says family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
the sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice
to become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past
most of these kids now a days read books because they watch the movie to the story
its not just a pass of time like people say it is
they are out in the world and and there is nothing that you can do to stop it
we stuck our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollably laughing
b we laugh about it all the time
also there are sites to teach little kids how to read or write
<caps> on it was cake time
so we did turn the t
they want all the guys to stair
my second reason is because you can learn about far away places
they came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified requiring over sixty thousand dollars
scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place
another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the empire state building
she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images
patience is one of the most important things in life
then at libraries there are also those books and magazines
when reading this story you can really tell that this family was happy
some parents <month> not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying
a key element in our relationship is laughter
i was on the floor curled into a ball trying really hard not to pee my pants when all of sudden i hear this bang sound
that was the end of the wars plus i almost broke my leg
i think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life
or if you wanted to know when <organization> died
me and my grandma finally leave and i have my new phone with and i like it
causing so many errors my team mates and i are just not paying to one another and not acting like a team
also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
however in the 1920s this was a dream of many
laughter is a important part of my life
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
another obstacle the builders faced was forceful winds
the last kind of books i think is offensive is <caps> books because they are hard to read them in <caps>
but its not good to be in patient
have the parents show you their berth certificate
they both and always say will see
<person> is a young boy with a bladder of a squirrel and his waiting in line for the bathroom at the super <caps>
another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature
being patient was a hard thing for me to overcome
she dosed over to and ripped <caps>
these are the reasons i chose both <caps> and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt
authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library
my family must be tired of our neverending inside jokes
law was also a problem
they hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it <month> be offensive to some people
he goes away for long periods of time
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
perhaps some day your child will get a job working in on office where they must use computers all day long
in the memoir the author creates a happy mood
if you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends
kids fifteen and and older would understand
information you would find at museum <num> years ago
after following the old mens advice he sets off on his journey
the empire state building at the time it was being built was designed to be the tallest building in the world
every body except my family brought rods and feels
thats really bad for your health
that would be a negative
all phones must be switched off
<person> caught up to me and tried to pull me back to the house but i resisted with all my might
the people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story
the terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut
i think the mood that is created by the author in this memoir is cheerful and welcoming
they often state that it is their favorite book of all time
wanting to go on so badly
so when she gets off work we would pack up and leave
many things can affect a cyclist
many critic and saying not many people interact with family and friends
the computer saves money for a lot of us
last <caps> my mom ordered <caps> <caps> and i was patient for an entire <caps>
while this was going on <person> had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming
the feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough
we laughed and made jokes on how tiny i am as well as how much fun it was after i felt a little better
but back in <location> time it was very commonly said and used in his society
computer use is a growing problem
we were all hungry so we decided to get some <organization>
this shows the author is grateful and happy
the music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular
i think that computers are not as good as some people think
i never heard how he got out but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad
my sister on the other hand still did not quite believe that laughter could do all of that
also the might be times go on a trip and know how much it cost and how long its going to take to set to you destination
it always has some kind of value
whatever the kid hears he will repeat
in conclusion i informed you on why i dislike computers
i will never forget that birthday again
one day i went to a concert at <organization> and there was a very long line
thats why i think the mood is touching
there is a reason libraries have many sections
many <caps> would want to take this book off the shelves of all libraries
however thats what his parents did
we kept on talking <caps> i started to laugh again
our society is just going downhill from here
web chatting is a way to video people
that was the start of it
its a great quality to be able to laugh and help people
laughter can also be abused
i have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy
turns out thats not allowed in <organization> either
when a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity
hi my name is <caps>
the heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired
i was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me
in <date> laughter was a big key in the success of our annual <organization>
i also think that there are some cons
our teacher had assigned seats and <person> and i and two other people had to sit together
<person> and i started laughing at the dog because it stumbled around for a few minutes and then decided to sit down and just bark at he tree
censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries
having offensive literature in a library makes it look as though its a bit trashy
he felted loved because his parents sacrifice for him
the first part of the path was simple
for example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation
this can be viewed as metaphorical also
there are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse
this could save someone time and effort
little did i know that was a big mistake
i feel offensive when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves
that last paragraph was quite vital to the theme and meaning of the story
if you are doing your homework and you forgot an answer
laughing is a key thing to a conversation but also its healthy for people to laugh
you also have a lot of fun said <location>
there is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to
i think people under twenty <caps> should not be aloud to check out movies or music
i thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard
also nature proposed a big obstacle as well the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
not <caps> a girl but a gorgeous girl
thats the kind of mood this author created for me as i read this memoir
allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building came with a lot of obstacles to make it work
the ride there was long but we made it
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the story tells about the girls transition into the different culture
i think computers do have a positive effect on people
those are some of the problems the builders had to face if they wished to dock dirigibles on the building
it works most of the time and children also see that
the most admirable quality of my fathers side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares
there is a lot of bad music
freedom of press is a right not many countries have
we headed into the crisp air without looking back
<caps> real name is <person> but we all call her <caps> because how she acts
that is how i <caps> feel
over the <date> i had gone to my <caps>
hydrogen is very flammable
i live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well
libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it
architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof
during the process of planning the <caps> of the building architects started to realize that there could be many complications
if you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic
at the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing
while the first few weeks in school he is picked on and made fun of
the answer is as simple as that
what if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew its tail end around to hit a building
you use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type
blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feeling on education on a certain topic
the first time i went to take the test i went with my best friend <person>
my third reason to why i feel we should keep computers is
they finally cleaned the apartment and got the xbow back
you flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up
i replied yeah sure man ill be over in a hour
but the light turned green as soon as i rounded the corner
i think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents
he said that what they did was a more courageous thing than he could have ever done
a time when i had to be patient was on the drive to <location> <caps> took a few hours so here is <caps> story
i had to wait three hours for food and drinks d so i was thirsty
my sister <person> and my niece <person> had just came down from <location>
minutes later a hefty waitress reeking of drugstore perfume and <time> nights hangover sets down glasses of water and drags off sluggishly
you could probably find one in a common household
he biked to the first town but it was like a ghost town
computers should be known as our friends
i do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf
they help students catch up or fully understand something
it was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left
she closed her palm around it and held it tight
schools should use computers because its the best way to get the information that you need to do something
i forget her name but she likes to talk with a <caps> accent
so we can call people
my brother was in preschool at the time <caps> they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do and i had to help him
the man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat
i will be back here in <num> minutes for waiting i will even <caps> in a free tie
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
one main reason was that it was illegal for dirigibles to dock
i agree with you on this article
they to not be bored
do you think your job would be harder
we were shopping in my favorite store at the time called <caps> <caps>
it just depends on how society feels about the whole situation
and it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off
you could go in chats with your coworkers or your boss for a meeting
to do this the would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel
while others argue that they are very helpful
computers teach handeye coordination
from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles
this <month> cause an effect on that child and they <month> start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing
<caps> they have gone to the college fund for money
she came back and she told i can go right on in
work get finished a lot a quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends
we continued to make small talk as our group took a tour through the building
that was the time laughter brought two people together
<caps> heart sank into <caps> stomach
the computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge
thank you for taking your time and reading i really appreciate it
censorship is a great problem
the number one problem of the <location> is obesity
to my surprise she took my gesture and ran back to hug me
that took off another two hours
the first reason why computers are bad because <caps> <caps> cause addition to your child
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
my sister and i thought it would be hilarious if all of a sudden the boat tipped over
it would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast
with the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination
i am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library
so you and a lot of others payed for this book and now you want to wast that money
he just sit in front of his computer and do nothing
nature played a great part in a obstacle because it would always be unpredictable
i was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance
that is why i thank that some stuff should be not on the shelves in stores
having someone to laugh with is just very important to have in life
i strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer
traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills
people need to accept that the world is not all sunshine and rainbows and that gruesome stuff is out there
when i am upset i have a very distinctive laugh
they are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives
<caps> seen the sign for the street but <caps> turned the wrong way into a field
this <month> actually improve some people social if they are shy
it was all to prepare us for tonight
i have always felt this weird feeling in my head after i laughed
me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat
everyone says that hearing a baby laugh is great
others like the violence in those shows
as you can see being patient is hard but it is a very important trait to have
when we got there and hopped out to pay and get in
thank you for your time
it shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower
its like the adult section at the library
being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth
also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer
then you go get a new bottle to start using
the task of actually docking would be a problem as well
this way very easy considering i typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate
maybe theres a waiting list to enter
oh not that make me to
<caps> was calling my name to take me off
i was patient about getting my phone
i jumped in my truck and headed to my mothers house
i remember sitting in the fort and talking to her about anything that came up
the builders faced so many obstacles to dirigibles on the empire state building
i also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to
the quote laughter is the shortest distance between two people is accurate in my opinion
he thanks and learns from his both parents for all they did to go on with their children no matter what they had to sacrifice for them
he gets up eats breakfast
weather its waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend i am never patient
there are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view
it was the end of the year
i know that <person> and <person> are the best friends i will ever have
so this ride was torturous due to the setting
even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year
we all started laughing as <caps> was showing us her bruises from falling down the stairs
the builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the dirigibles
as to remove books should not be allowed no matter how or what the content of the book <month> be
the trailer went quiet
i stood there confused for a minute before i had found out what happened
i can bet the number is going to be about <percent> of the time you are in you office
so grateful appears to be a keyword
finally is the structure first there was the ghost town with the battery acid tasting water
this can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer
my grandma had went to the bathroom and i was stick in the monkey bars
the back of the ship would move around the mooring mast
everyone should not live offended by anything or anyone
nowadays everyone uses the computer as their main form of communication
one mood is happiness
the setting had a huge affect on the cyclist
com and get a great answer
my first example is my father
the kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone
<caps> to a doctor at <organization>
but books are not rated such as movies are
<caps> wants his parents to know that <caps> loves them very much and lets them know by thinking them
computers are necessary for <month> reasons
he wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless
so he was out of water and was going to be thirsty
the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist in a negative way
the winds on top of the building were shifting because of violent air currents
i strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves
one mood shown in the memoir is great love
it teaches you bad thing it changes your life
this presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution
and who knows they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak
the mood created by the author in this memoir is happiness
she sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for
when i found out enough information i would then be able to find the ten year old
more parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things
i was patient when my mom was giving birth to my baby brother
the team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one
we waited <num> minutes plus the time for every to get out
this gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive
the hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland
this is simply a result of bad censorship
the biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians
<caps> expressed the love his parents had by explaining their hard work as they experience financial and personal struggles
at the end of my speech everyone clapped
thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration
say no <num> computers
they sat on the warm sand and talked for ten minutes
people should learn how to deal with different struggles in life
and that was a story with <num> examples of me having to be patient
they wont get the recommended one hour of exercise a day
that brought pretty happy laughter to us both
today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves
tons of these people have not seen were <num>
the same difficulty in the road
the dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels were silenced
she refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is
he was also drinking his bottle of water hard
<caps> said <caps> wanted him so she told us to go to the <caps> <caps> and tell them <caps> wanted <caps> so <caps> raced to the <caps> <caps> and on the way there <caps> thought of names
we talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go
even though she failed the test she is still going to try again
keep reading to find out more
it was a good weekend
that can advance the knowledge of citizens
so in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could
computers are no help to this problem
those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world
well all you need is a computer
many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow
most patient person i have ever met
that just goes to show how much i use computers each day
when i was in <num> grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient
they are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling
all of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist
even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed
it hurt so bad but i was patient through all of it
thank you for listening
there are games on websites
the freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want
well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why i think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf
we <month> never know who is actually right or wrong about <caps> topic
the biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map
libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf
people naturally type about thirty words a minute
but my ego had a ready answer
<caps> obstacle was mother nature
and some of these people might be safer staying inside
the <person> family has always been complicated
lastly builders would have to face the obstacle of nature
it is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment
if they did that then they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system
paragraph <num> this shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful
computers are growing daily
laughter in a relationship the most important thing in a relationship is laughter
so for that <time> <person> and i were stuck homeless
sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about
it also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from
there should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern
history makes a difference in our lives and its what we need
the parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not
it can make someone a better person
the law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas
now a day its not like that for a lot <organization> people
another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself
another health risk is having bad eyes
patience means to wait calmly for something
he has thanked them so many times but he cant show them how truly grateful he is of them
not only were those large factors coming into play but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the empire state
then it was time <date> go
he was <caps> grateful for his parents caring and selflessness
computers <caps> said that computer help <percent> of <caps> with their handeye coordination
we learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other
today i am talking about patents
but i knew when it was time patience would pay of
i think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper
we always go for about a one to two hour hike
some material have sex and violence that is offensive
but for whatever reason he told me to take the nozzle end out to some flowers
that gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework
i tried not to think of it too
as soon as <caps> got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving
he also talked about how the road was rough
they all looked different
i said yeah and patients is a good thing to have
my second example is the effect of the computer
another mood is happiness
the building was high up <caps> the wind currents were volatile and constantly shifting in result the back of the dirigibles would swivel around and around the mooring mast
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
lots of people are laughing right now
a third reason is that it can teach you handeye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
<caps> <person> got up everybody tried to tell him to sit down but all he did was ignore them
it has been amazing how computers help us so much
or spend time with family and friends
using the computer this way is another terrific idea
there was many obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the empire state building
the quote means the mood of the community is kind and helping
another key point to look at is obesity
i state this because the web has many things to do
no worries the person no contact you by a simple email
i was scared for his health and scared that i was the reason for his drinking
these precautions would have to be taken which were obstacles for the empire state building
<percent> of obesity is caused by the use of computers
not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately
one of the most valuable things are brains are capable of is a sense of humor
personally i love cats more than dogs but <caps> will always be the first
when we first started talking to each other it was between notes i would give my friend <caps> and <caps> would give them to him
lets just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together
just by using computer
you cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people
the strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at <location>
a second obstacle they faced were the laws against it
it just barely fit all of us
and <caps> had unselfish family because they moved for her and let her grow up in a good community
he also bought me a new bike and it was sick
i know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and email your job
i do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate
watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life
another thing was nature the winds would not let a blimp land there
you will agree with me and why i think that
the others are either buying things or playing games
second the greatest concern was safety
last but not least he is happy because he lives with everyone he loves
my mom was looking at her watch
<person> gave me pointers after i had thrown three rise balls
if you are under the age of eighteen there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent
computers are also safe to make sure your kids are safe
allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the empire state building was never thought of an easy task to accomplish
the computer allows you to connect win people who <month> live faraway with out having to travel to them
this warm <caps> is quick to mix with about anything and sticks to things all the same
laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows
i finally got them back in the month of <date>
we sure need computer to look up information these days
i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home
with the computer came smaller more compact computers till they were able to fit in the palm of our hand
and how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information
this affected him because he <caps> got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning
he has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish
it can bring people together and it can bring peace
though he just rubbed it back onto mine
next they how it happen you say
the next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed
my third example is how the experts say that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends
<caps> time <caps> parents told me we were going to <location> for the day
it was my idea to show him so i would be the one to get it
this helps develop skills later on such as problem solving
i think having computers are good because you can use it to find places
we just have to teach our kids what <caps> good and what <caps> <caps>
most music should have a positive message to it
do you know anyone in the world that can say the computer is not fun
it is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them
i think that the baby is truly loved by its family
so why try and control us all as one
my niece and nephew is just one example
and another one was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
they design the <num> floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers
there was also a law that was in their way
for a moment we all just stare at her
soon after everyone else arose from their warm blankets
they communicate there more than they could without computers
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die
we finished quicker than if <person> was working by himself and came away with the greatest feeling
the cyclist a had rough time
<caps> is only six about to be seven
one of are bases <person> said
the moment of breakdown was as she got the flower
it would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties
these thing should have been brought to the builders attention with obstacles such as nature and lawbreaking are in play
when he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated
computer are a great resource in our everyday lives so why not use what we were given
that was the time i had to be patient
i also knew that there was a potential of them being angry with me
they did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area
music can tell you the life of people by poetry
laughter is used as a cure for everything
with the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world
the laws prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas
if that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands
i began to really enjoy <caps> <caps>
millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference
if there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink
many books have been on the banned book list
from that point we were inseparable
so if we cancel that show on <caps>
it showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it
when i went to <caps> point everybody went on this scary high in the sky ride an you have to take your shoes of than we got something to eat
i was in class waiting i new that it would come soon
the last thing i would want my children seeing in a <caps> is offensive material
fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs
<caps> soon <caps> the words left his mouth he regretted saying them
i certainly think computers have a positive effect on people
lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state
hello my name is <person> <caps> and i am going to enforce you that computers can benefit our society
he was amazed of how big and how much i had changed in toughs long twelve years that he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me
when i was done packing
like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again
headed for the skyline
you would get addicted to being on the computer all the time
after the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking
a time were i was patient was when i had to wait in the waiting room before i got my broken foot
have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
after we were done we decided to go back into the house
and i think its crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things
in addition jobs have been lost from this had economy
and it more people are outside will notice how nature is and <person> says that use of the electricity in a house
throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes
starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building
i was on cloud nine and no one was about to bring me down
now imagine it gone from the libraries
<caps> is kind of shy around other ducks and <person> is very content just sitting next to me or a bench
which has been proven by <organization> news
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
if there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested
laughter is a daily part of my life
this exert from the test supports my previous statement about how its hot because the speaker tells us how hes sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage
it is an amazing feeling when you get it for him
from all the violent wind and air currents would be hard to tether the dirigibles to the mast
i walked down the same street i walked down every day were the buss dropped me off
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents
yes once you were happy you had a computer
i feel like everyone should try new things
having a computer is a huge benefit to society
his life so far in <location> must be great
it is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason
<caps> are <num> concluding examples of obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to <caps> near empire state building
he tells me almost every <date> that he is going to marry me
my peers and i stood behind the stage watching the assembly unfold
toothed buffalohorn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water
the hibiscus shows it with its budding stage
this gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something
so that would make then miss out on going to the library for books
the last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games
thats my way of thinking about the computers helping us in our education
we walked along the paths and eventually climbed up a an outlined path to get a get closer view of the <organization> and we were enthralled
the builders had to modify the frame of the empire state building and design a custom mooring device
we were sitting here and getting pretty impatient
everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials
it gives them the chance to interact in a different way
they never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her
one of these obstacles being stress
to that i said well can i still use the computers there to get information
you the work on the computer
would add stress to the buildings frame
<caps> i went back in line and it moved way slower
laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you
why would you want people in the community or people period to not be comfortable where they are at
he describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting
this is one reason why i think that computer have a positive effect on people
it took four days to get down there
i was trying to do the best i could to make make money
but that it is why these books are created for older people to read
the family happiness
i think that there could be some things adults can read and some things kids can read
now i was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when i get a game
builders fix this problem by making over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications
but the more we laugh the more we are going to be happy
a family that i have been close to my whole life had moved to <location> due to jobs
i payed for the to bowls of food and we went to our bus stop and went to downtown <person>
i ready really quickly and went and picked up <caps>
my main criteria is someone who can make me laugh
<caps> next reason why computers help out in society is computers help learn about handeye coordination
another obstacle was <caps> the mast to the top of the frame
a majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this <caps> brings
she needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country
our friendship has always been great with not lying to each other
then they were absolutely correct
the authors parents were very nice and friendly
i spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family
but i think we will <caps> has treated me so well and i appreciate him and what he does for me
it is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it
is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside
some people have family in another country
the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech
that being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework
even though <caps> got some free food i well still mad that <caps> sat there all that time
the worst part was i had to get three shots and i hate shots
computers today are consuming our world
no responsible parent would be caught dead with a <num> year old on an adult website and computers make it harder such parents to do so
also computers now have videos all over on how to do things like how to and other useful information
search engines like <organization> or yahoo provide answers in less than one second
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style
one obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being hold by a cable tether only would cause stress to the buildings frame
when working on the <caps> you get distracted
my friends found this hysterical
there were many problems to over come in the construction of the mooring mast on the empire state building
that how i feel about this situation
computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you <month> have missed as if you was absent
the day we left i was so excited and i was running all around the house yelling
heres a story about time when i was patient
i was patient on the plane waiting to get there
i remember one time when my <caps> <caps> i went to hang out at the mall
i came up with the best idea i have thought of yet
they provide you with information and they increase your skill when it comes to technology
my next opinion is we wont be able to get out of the house to see the beautiful nature
the author is grateful and proud because her parents welcomed with open arms people of all types
and at least i still got to play with my friend
we met through <caps> <caps> lessons at our local dance studio
it can help people drives it decreases reaction time and it can help people write more neatly
basically this excerpt is talking about the the mooring mast
computers helps the <organization> locate most wanted criminals
the dog jumped up and bit me in my face
this allowed us to email another school
people are not always as they say they are
this saves the biker progress and most likely scared him
so it wont do any good to try to get rid of it
the lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide
they went through problems because they were not sure if the dirigibles would fit
the teacher was helping a different person so i waited
it allows you to start a new life without leaving your room
i went to go welcome her and i saw my shoes lay there
in the memoir he grew up in a kitchen full of people who taught him to love cooking
they also helped other people in need which seemed to complete their lives
well good for you mission accomplished
different types of these works of literature are significant to each person
but she is able to realize that this is her new home and everything is becoming more familiar to her
i think computers are an asset to the community
limit your time to a half hour a day
it was patient waiting to go to <caps>
these are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me
computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology
laughter saved my life
so i just went along with it and sucked it up
laughing can be the antidote for a frown
the next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out
i think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
then when we left we went to get some food because we were all hungry
a good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention
to me laughter is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them
a fork lift driver not somehow managed to get his fork lift stuck in the trailer
after that i open my presents
the girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was
so we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger
it has a pretty strange name due to the fact that the water is actually a greenish color because the reflection of the trees that surround it
it was <caps> much fun
that shows shes a very loving and caring person to actually be <caps> for something your parents have done
each time it is our turn we have come up with a new way and new position of sending the ball down the lane
some people would say that people spend too much time on computers
if you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located
she told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken
that is when i found out that we were moving
he also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated
the second reason why computers are bad is because of what people past on the computer about other people
the terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road
there are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books
many dirigibles outside the united states use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen
we both had <caps> with us
i always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog
by now over half the period had gone by
i love <caps> but once a year or so <caps> patient enough to wait until <date> downward
i have to wait to go to my aunts
besides there are more important issues at the moment
mood means the overall atmosphere of the authors words
we all got in the pool even the parents
<caps> quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come
the computer teacher people
and every night i tell <caps> its bed time and i sleep with my wonderful <organization>
as you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist
as you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly
it keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school
so readers of the <location> <organization>
more time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often
slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and <person> starts explaining herself
during <date> i had to go to the doctor to get shots <caps> that i could be safe
of course you are going to be tired if you sit for a couple hours staring at a computer screen
certain people like certain kind of music
now she can be prepared
you can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment
books are for any reader that decides they want to go to that world
one time when i was patient is when i was a little kid and my mom said we were going on a top to visit my cousins in <caps> <caps>
a big thing that <month> conflict with censorship is the idea of religion
lets say a family is planning a vocation to <location>
they invited immigrants to their house to eat and celebrate the arrival of the united states
what is going to happen to all of the sports in the world
none of the dirigibles were able to dock because of the high current
i think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps make learning about other countries easier
i was so tired from doing everything that after i was done unpacking my room i went and took a nape on my bed
the music should only be something children are suppose too listen too things that are in their age group
that means that all the times he had been with his <caps> or his dad they help him though life and difficulty of his education and work
you can talk to people on certain websites
i also played some games
the author is very grateful for all that his parents did for him
i will take the test again
they spent <money> on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building
we were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt
after they completed this issues relating to safety arose
at <caps> middle <organization> i had everything going for me
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems
they spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to
a good way it to watch the movie and learned from it
i could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell
this book has many issues when it comes to political correctness
i had a friend well she is <caps> best friend and we know each other from <num> grade then in <num> grade she said she said she has to move to <location>
the results were very disappointing
it really did look like a diamondbackblocked the majority of the pavement in front of me
seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it
children should have the right to explore the literature world however they want
then you could print it out whenever you need it
then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and thats money lost
books can be fiction or nonfiction
we cried <caps> held each other because there was nothing more we could <caps>
so i just go on the computer and talk to them its one of the fastest ways and fun ways to
i noticed something instantly
some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them in the house
it is important for parents to let their children know what is right or what is wrong
like most boys he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them
people have a choice of what they want to buy and rent
after an hour of searching i decided on one
i can see where some things in the library are very offensive and where somethings are not offensive
you need this to live your life
my heart belongs to you no one else cause if your not the one that has my heart than my heart will just be a toy and brake it
censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion
the features of setting affect the cyclist
not spending time with your family and friends is an awful thing to do
hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us
another big impact in the bunch of the mooring mast was law
the writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences
heart disease is the number one cause of death in the <location>
it had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on
the features of the setting only drain the cyclists willpower
he needed to find a place with water
people can be influenced to do just about anything
a book not read <month> as well never have been written
with a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them
no i <caps> not believe there should be any censorship in libraries
it would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left
many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time
he loves to follow me all over my house
<person> yelled goodbye to his mom as he closed the door behind us and we headed for the truck were my <caps> was still waiting
other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it
but <num> month was not that long
almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed
and because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out
when people think of soccer they think of the goalie
<caps> not their choice though
you can learn history or about the present time
but using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct
he was grateful for his parents giving him all they could
the tension in the air was almost to thick
we now live in a world where everyone voices their opinion freely and you can not be punished for doing so
i do not regret doing this because it was one of the best burgers i have ever had the delight of eating
it is already <date> and we are using the computer for so much
if you were going on a vacation to somewhere in <location> you could learn about what those people do
that was just one of the many things we love to laugh about
i had to beg our couch to let us out as soon as she opened the door i ran out as fast as i could
this is what i think should be done with this offensive materials
<person> was pronounced dead on the day of <date>
i felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more
in spring when all of these events take place
their feathers started to lose their color
that is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that
the team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress
and we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days
i like the freedom and easiness of a computer
they use it a little too often
we <month> have the right to take down the books but why should we
a library is built for other people enjoyment
if you ban books then you will ruin the future
she drove home and put the dress on
not every person in this world has the same opinion
i was so stoked and so happy that i had passed i was mostly just surprised my <caps> advice had worked
it smoothing up the vibe and if you <month> be and a bad mood that music you <month> like <month> claim you down in put you and a better one
taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news
he tried to be patient but it was hard
this is the first year i have ever played a sport in high school and i am glad i did it because i am having so much fun
censorship in media has been around since the beginning of <organization>
my mom to i her body to be waited of just target about the boy
the cant control what books are in the library
for example if a man came in a library and asked the library to remove a book that is about murdering and has violence in it
the steel frame of the building should be strengthened or modified to accommodate this new situation
so i had to pause the show because they cant do anything when the <caps> is on
students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed
that is just too much
<location> is a place where much business happens for the <organization>
i for one think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information
its never like seeing them in person
finally the ghost towns
i <caps> and put the earphones aside and left the store
as i ran and jumped everything was good
but they were just a regular <person> that played normal music
the computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher
we go to school for a vast amount of reasons
is what i thought the author in the memoir mood was
also they came to this country with not knowing how to speak this language
criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art
your health is also very important
she believed that he would try to learn witchcraft
we both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about
which means they were kind and selfless
computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives
such as some parents think its okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on
a <num> foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame
but sometimes in movies people hear something from the movie and they spread it around the <location>
it us helps us look up facts or recent news quickly
i think everything should be there
in conclusion computers are an easier way to get information
builders in the mooring <caps> by <organization> face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building
i am glad laughter played such an important part in my life
you can learn quite a bit with a computer
everybody has the right to read whatever they want
we laughed at some of our choices because of the reasons that we liked them
as we waited all i could think about was how bad my feet were hurting in those shoes
this way you can make arrangements
the scenery was getting more and more empty
the short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill
just <date> my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in <date>
you can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework
this novel is about a world where all books are burnt
he got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead
my opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book
it was hard to be patient but in the end it payed off
those were just some of the many problems the dirigibles faced while passing the empire state building
the <caps> of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful
in my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban
i collected the eggs
the next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said yes
this brings a very calm mood of how their home brings them together
art is what makes people creative
every now and then we make fun of her but she laughs along because we all know it could have been anyone of us
the first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that
i hope you consider this
without computers we could not be where we are today
the hibiscus is a lucky charm to her to keep during the test to strive her to pass the test
in the excerpt it said the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents this created another safety problem
he had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life
i enjoy the feeling i get <caps> i meet someone and i know that we connected great
thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere
her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her drivers test again in the spring
the setting affects the cyclist because its real hot
everything is good if its balanced
being patient is hard
this project towards transportation of the future for the empire state building was no easy task
we were both quite upset and frankly we were in no laughing mood
the winds on the top of the empire state building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
computers are made it do all <caps> to help us learn
now he just a nobody
there is usually a lot of people at the doctors when i go
you know now when you have that project due for science class about protoplasms
we then filled the make shift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on
she was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair
there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
my mom was just watching <caps>
my last reason why computers are good to have around is
the cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did
others might not think anything of the item and move along
then again its just my opinion
its like drugs they are so easy to get
if there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is
even very little kids can play games
if you talk to them in a long time wondering how there doing what they life
the <caps> includes free speech which insures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters
the nature of the ships would cause the body to sway in the wind
another thing the computer can teach you is about animals
in conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more
all these thing can be reversed
but excessive daily use of computers is causing doctors to see more cases of carpal tunnel crop up
<caps> are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story
we cam improve <caps> just by computer
this shows that almost half of the students at just the middle school are on the computer
children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision
a computer is a very helpful resource
my mom boy friend timed the rid it was only <num> seconds long
then it took us six hours to get to <location>
she simply understood that <caps> wanted to check out and return one
we could use a rating just like movies do
when i got home i was still angry so i went to the garage i have a punching bag in there
i had asked for some napkins but we did not get none
when they had finished hugging my mom calls out my name and i start walking toward her
think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves
books are suppose to help you and give you the real thing
always being on your computer is bad for your health
they were telling me how funny it would be if it was slow motion
some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though
while being helped in return
with everything made and put up we were ready for <caps>
he is happy to have a home to stay in and finding his new life ahead of him
certain materials in libraries should be removed
he thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned
when riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist
sometimes i hear him cry <caps> night
of <caps> will agree they spend at least <num> hours a day on their computer
that was when we heard an announcement
this memoir did however express a lot of feelings though
wed been walking for a good six hours now <caps> snacking on left over jerky scraps
d because they are for adults reading sections
you will never see the world for what it is
having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below
explicit material is available everywhere you look
i believe there should be a national rating system for books like there is in the movie industry
by far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos
posters layered over the plain paint with fascinating pictures and words
another reason i think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information
they teach positive things for people to learn
a computer can help the save more goals by increasing their handeye coordination
also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water
he was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
<caps> say anything that wont offend her
the computer also has lots of music that you can listen to
chilled with my downtown friends at <num> park
i believe laughing really is healthy for you
in the memoir they talk about family and how the love each other
the reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands
simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun
on my birthday i invited a bunch of friends over to my house
having a home is sweet
i looked at <location> and she looked at me and we started busting up laughing
i said through partially clenched teeth
and he goes to highest level in his company except the boss
besides many of the things that people should be censored is probably not that bad
the main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy
they also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning
before computers <caps> and calculating took <percent> more time but now they get our work done quickly and without error
the snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought
these people can offend you
make go in the woods and wake around
one final problem they faced was the safety of the people
another obstacle the builders faced was safety
its a common theme around the globe
the bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes
who likes being patient its so boring
<caps> says growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
computer dead is a term i call when all we want to do is use the computer
which is funny how those books are the only books that were fun to read during the school year
you can be alone on the computer in a dark room
it is something you definitely need to have
my dad built a small one roomed cabin there a few summers back
they save work on their and they use computers to build things
i thanked her and asked what took so long
she was patient and did not complain
this made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building
when you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves
he sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids
the faint shimmer of the blaze was the only light we had
mostly all of the are just the type that like to be laughing all the time but we are closer because of the way we are with each other
so then the next day you wont fail the science test
computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family
thats my opinion and answer to the story
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it
its just not the right way to handle things
<person> could turn any activity into a lighthearted experience
i yelled for my big brother who was playing his game
the point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public
all that is a computer
some spend years trying to perfect their masterpieces
when i got to <caps> house she opened the door and let me in
we got everything packed and ready to go even the dogs were ready to go
older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials
i made a call to my sister <person> to see if she would do me the favor of picking us up from <location>
students were making cards for <person> family
it brings a whole package
without those books in that library i would have never been able to research those topics
but she says its because its strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the united states
i waited till about half of the game and wondered when i would be in
having family come live with you till they get back on their feet
if you need directions you can look it up on the computer
he runs out of water
the person does not have his or hers phone
she cant alway be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now
but mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still
on that <date> we picked him up <caps> took <num> years of patience for my sister and only <num> years for me
the biggest one is typing
after one hill the cyclist sees a building
my sister and i became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation
<caps> rushed ahead kicking the air
the setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome
if they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them
this led to the second obstacle which was modifying and strengthening the the steel frame of the empire state building to accommodate the first obstacle
he said one of his goats had gotten out
being suck in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way back from were ever we came back it is a lot of bonding time
wow how scared did i get
<num> out of <num> people do this in <location> everyday
am sorry but thats not how life works
i think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a room just for grown ups
also some of the information might not even be true
technology is not our enemy
if so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside
<caps> its <person> wedding and its important
the sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels
then theres my <date> <caps>
so i am here today to tell you all about them things
although my family was embarrassed for what i had done they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time
thats when i began to get impatient
private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law
another reason is due to violent air currents the back of a dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast
the <organization> stated that a near <percent> <organization> students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know
one of which i really need for a homework assignment on the movie <caps>
when i woke up and walked out of the living room mom and all my friends screamed surprise and i was definitely surprised
camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends
this is what i try to do and do while waiting for cedar point to come along
they turn people into low life scums and criminals
one final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas
libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests
strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the empire state building
the computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while
those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically
the final part of the memoir presents great thanks to the authors parents
the builders of the empire state building face a couple challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it
i believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like
some people have different opinions of the book or it means something different to them
i guess i could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard
his water supply is running how and he is dehydrated
they also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet
the vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down
the unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles
<caps> i hope today hell have a little more patience hopefully
another reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can <caps> us communicate with our friends and family
you can still interact with your family and friends either in <caps> chat or <caps>
this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world
the persons health their the users well being
the thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous
happiness is a key to life
debates have come up on whether or not computers are benefiting or destroying society
it is the same thing with music artists and screenplay writers
when she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit
it was very hot and the dehydrated him
mooring dirigibles would lead weights was out of the question because they were a danger to pedestrians
i had tears of laughter in my eyes before i remembered that i had made a solemn vow to loath <person>
sports are what help you with handeye coordination
i also knew that they could still turn on me if i did something wrong
when you use a computer it is completely free
i needed three hours to finish
the author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know
this made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it
her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt
another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit
that certainly does not benefit society
<caps> put me in a better mood
you should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section
his parents always allowed family members to come and stay
i had a great friend named <person>
then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem
the mood created in the memoir is i think comfort and happiness
this is my first benefit of a computer
laughing releases tension and for me i feel like it brings me closer to my friends
finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree simply will not ever be done
<caps> not hard to find another in our city
something thats really good for communicating is video chat
the <caps> of laughter the <caps> of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing
pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime
they could try suicide
the mood the author created in the memoir was
i am sad to announce that we will be opening up <caps> <caps> in <num> more minutes
every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom
another reason why i think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing
this was true because it would add stress to the buildings frame
this flower represented hope
you can do <caps> many things on the computer to have fun
he had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted
to most people they are going to want to take those kinds of books off of the shelf
id caught the biggest fish of the day
the best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else
i was watching this t
the next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions
a book that needs to be censored should not be in an <caps> school
united states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable
the computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed
that was the best patient day of my life
its not so hard to decide to censor something when its only your opinion
because of them <person> lived a life filled with happiness and love
censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though
so i m waiting then we get off the ride they we go on the <caps> <num> <caps> line for <num> second ride
it was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area
then he told me he knows that i thought he forgot about the phone
throughout the process of construction the empire state building contractors faced couple of obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it
after the waltz i danced the second waltz with my dad
books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in
students read books about the past so that they learn
they follow what technology to make life <caps>
my last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day
even if we try our best to make them happen i doubt they will
again i was waiting for over twenty minutes
i learned to be patient with all sorts of things
laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life
the cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all
i think i gained a little more patience that day
<location> looked at me and we both starting laughing
<caps> <caps> if that was someone you loved
being on the for a while is not a waste of time
i just had a strong contempt for <caps> class
<caps> <num> supports that obstacle a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame
i was also patient when my little brother
we were all laughing and enjoying each others company <caps> <caps> and <person> decided to go to the store and buy some things using <caps> car
the last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says shell wait until spring to take the test again
or is it just a doggy thing
gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide
hibiscus is budding this way the flower will be starting new and so will she
throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived
the author creates a very warm mood and inviting mood that makes you want to feel relaxed and comfortable
i think that the mood created by the speaker is gratitude
of course theres going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it
someday your kids will ask questions about that that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students
they leave a positive effect on people in the community and world
sleep and then hit the road the next day
all we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen
people should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music
west as game <organization> ball <caps> than chichi <num> for <caps>
some people <month> want all censorship items out of public areas
a parent should keep a close eye on what their child read or see
there is entertainment for everyone
and its a way they get kidnapped
lets start off with a book that has killing in it
i the class closet at ping she will clap third time until they stop talking or quiet
dinner was served and we all took our normal seats
this is along the lines of personal thought
most of my friends are also my friends because of my laughs and times i make them laugh
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
she looks at me and says <caps> is that day
<month> be you have been trying to lose some extra pounds
this shows that hes getting frustrated and losing some hope
<date> came along the second <date> of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing <caps>
and lets not forget <organization>
the sun was beginning to beat down
how home is a place you learn to love and admire your relatives
computers also evolved how people can communicate with each other
books can lie about whats about to happen to the world
the wind and weather could make a landing the dirigibles very dangerous
that is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids
<date> when searching through the library you never know what <caps> will find on the shelves
computers are a great thing during down time and have positive effects on people
that is also causing childhood obesity
most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways
also how she still loved her ritual song she sings with her family
the longest amount of time i can stay patient for is about five minutes any longer than that puts me over the edge
everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library
when me and my family went to <location> we went for my two little brothers appointment
being patient is when you wait for someone or something
their is a little store on that coroner
we told him the news and he took into the room
the plant will grow if it can adapt
never being able to thank your parents enough for giving you that chance to live a happy life is also part of the mood
some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over <num>
i could feel the tears starting to swell <caps> in <caps> eyes
it was <num> and <caps> appointment was at <time>
their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer
parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read
so <person> and i went down stairs to see if her mom <caps> knew why <person> was acting so ridiculous
now computers are very popular
notice i was very patient with her and this was the month of <date>
we cannot really do anything about this
this quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing
this could not of made his ride easier
most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset
in unity it shows that in their neighborhood most of the immigrants were always having feasts and being really close to each other
but it was ten hours long
in conclusions computers have made a great impact on <date> society
i will try to give details on why it does not or if it has to be taken off the shelf
there are a couple of obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
that will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will
so conflicts are never really brought up
if this happened then they never would have been able to land
many people before us went through everyday life without them
i was a little confused when we landed <num> minutes later in <location>
they help set the table and eat with them so i can tell they are all really loving and caring and all enjoy being a family together
or you can find out what is happening with your sister who lives in <location>
eventually the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the empire state building was scrapped
but as years passed on the idea of using the mooring mast died out leaving there to be no more obstacles to face
in the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclists will to ride to the next town
the mood also sounds very loving because he loves his parents for moving to <location>
but mainly because of the recent <caps> issue
it makes you think of your own family
whenever i needed someone to talk to she would be the one
we ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools
than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want
it was all worth the wait
after that i always began to tell myself that i had a horrible voice and i knew <caps> was the reason why the crowd at the <organization> laughed at me
none of these groups ever intercepted each other
a computers makes it and it through a lack of information to just computer and find it faster
there are many ways in which the setting of rough road ahead affects the cyclist
books are essential to a students growth into adulthood
in almost all of books someone <month> be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else
no this would not happen just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys
if everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left
when i moved to <caps> i am always typing something
lastly family and friends
it all started at school thats where we met
my relationship with laughter
laughter is one of the many things i enjoy doing
just pick a book that has a theme you like
no for live but for our life or something <caps>
the hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring were it can bloom and became big and beautiful
first our parents read us books to get us to go to sleep
to do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made
i could borrow money from my grandma and get it then
things should still be out for the public to read or see
there was nothing around that he could drink
since students rely on their computers so much then always on them
you bear of people using computers to do work all of the time
if she said if it was a
so i just was watching him and watching him and then i said here you can have my money it is your birthday so here you go
both of us competed as gymnasts at <organization>
i know that a <organization> <organization> the <organization> should agree
however i saw one girl sitting in the back corner who i felt was scared just like i probably would have been if it was anywhere else
i slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts
setting standards on computers can improve this problems and help exercising
business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops
they should not be over used though and you need to keep a healthy mind and body
nature helps save the brain
another reason people need patience is their family
life is to short to worry and feel offended
treat others how you would like to be treated
also dirigibles are highly flammable
just as the container is alien to the flower because its used to being free
the workers on the empire <caps> building ran into many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there
the features of the getting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways
builders of the empire state building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
you would get your way
i stood up on the bench and hugged him as i started to laugh
right in the middle of it was a big rock and water went around both sides of it
the winds there were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
every year thousands of new books are introduced to the <caps> public
my friends exchanged glances and picked me up by my arms and legs and started carrying me towards the direction of the house
his book taught me a few things and made me think different about people
when building the empire state building the architects had to take the height
to give their children a better life
they have the authority and right to do so
i will tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience
young <caps> or the <caps> section is for mainly the teens
i gladly offered to babysit because i love being with her
the winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents
i would never watch <caps> or anything like <caps> but my friends who have watched <caps> have learned something
this is saying that there was a fun vibe in his house when he was growing up which makes you feel happy
<person> was already here of course because hes the <date> boy
he appreciates how his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family
the public i feel makes a big deal out of nothing
movies should be restricted from children to watch them
i am patient every even this year for <caps> so i can get some <caps>
my concentration got weaker as i begun to wonder what they were all laughing at
another way libraries can help is put the movies in a certain section
thank you again for listening
dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself
his parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family
until the final seconds ended
everyone is different no one person can speak for the whole world
both of our faces were priceless
you <month> ask what it is i am speaking about
they help you learn and even help with hard life situations
i just had to fin d the right person
<caps> sit there and watch and talk and bake in the sunlight
this has been a tricky question for years
you <month> be too into a <caps>
<person> friend <person> was a huge <caps> freak
and it is still the tallest in the world to this day
it was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas
i found directions within a second using a computer
my first reason that computers are a positive device to have is they can give you extra knowledge
go ahead and listen you will be amazed
there family is happy
then they invite you to do activities and
you would have to go to the library and search for a book about him
computers have only become faster and
<caps> also shows things about your personal info
he talks about the memories he had there
when getting in the car i forgot all about my bad day and how horrible i felt
he was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead
this is why landing blimps on the empire state building would be dangerous and difficult
this is how the setting affected the rider
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
i do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive
except maybe the first time i went to <organization>
the library workers know what they are doing
whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide
laughter is very important through life
some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be
this could cause issues with stability
i <caps> well ill teach you
that is what <caps> said yelling for five minutes straight
they also had to have wenches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring
so i asked her if i could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well
it should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children section has toys and puzzles in them and children theme walls
they should just keep an eye out of what kids are looking at
out of curiosity of what just happened i start walking over towards the tall grass
the first two quarters ended with a dead even score
he went to get a cell phone i wanted one to but i was to yang to get one
thats why you should believe that computers have positive effect on people
this task would be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the buildings frame
computers helps every one in all ages
pretends to fake shoot me
support advances in todays technology to help improve life for those of
some families have a tradition
nature being the second problem because violent air currents could shift the dirigible and cause damage and hurt pedestrians
the builders faced many obstacles when trying to make it possible to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building
my dad came running picked me up and put me in the truck to go to the <caps>
i think this because all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn
this shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless
i think that they can help people with what they need
the mood of the memoir is happy and thankful
i think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read
freedom of <caps> is our birth right and we should be aloud to say or write anything without being censored
<person> was still the last person in line his patience went down quite a bit
its not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time
the computers tell us how the war is and about what the president is doing
personally i have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers
computers teach handeye coordination too
most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble
offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content
he was so excited to go
without the patience of <caps> father <caps> family could live
at this point it was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work
this is a short glance of my childhood
i have written in this newspaper of things that should be left alone
she had her opinion and i also had mine
it protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age
my second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect
i was waiting in a long line to get in
there is a mood created by the author in the memoir
he had me play the notes again and again and together
and what <month> be offensive to me <month> not be offensive to you
like i stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home
the winds atop the building were constantly shifting
a book in <caps> time displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground breaking feat
there <month> be material that has racist comments
in the article it said many immigrants give their children a better life even when it meant leaving everything they loved
some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it
i almost opened my present three days before <caps>
when we arrived there were already people at the skateboarding spot we wanted to skate at
all these items are very animated things
she was the type of teacher that was strict when it came to where you sat in class
children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future
if everyone took a book off the shelve than none would be left
you say you are going to play for <num> minutes but they are so addicting you play for <num> hours
it was just too dangerous to attempt
there was such laughter that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise
then we walked the rest of the way to <num> mile and <person> where the was another bus that took us to <num> mile and <person> where my school is
unfortunately my group was last
we have the same interests in things
another theme that i thought fit was inspiration
there is going to be more good books for a person than bad books
there is no way to censor the universal language that music provides
the door swung open it was my dad and not for behind him was my mom
computers keep lots of kids of the streets instead of being out and causing trouble
<person> and <person> played tag while i watched
having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher cant read it she cant grade it
this obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building
my life is all about laughter and its special to me
it also gives you location and dates of different events that have happened in what you are looking up
well i hope you think about what i told you and take it into consideration
<caps> people have computers and go on them daily
we partied on till we realized we had a concert to attend
also <percent> of adults staying is good
once when i was eight years old my mom said that she would take me to the fair that day
but peoples education is also effected
he took a shortcut but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated
how would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert
kids should be able to read what they want to read
computers can help people in so many ways you just have to realize it
long distance phone calls cost a lot
and finally the last problem builders faced was the how to even get the blimp docked
the wind at times could be too powerful
i knew that meant something bad
let them do what they want to
the mood that was created by the author is loving
one day he says to me because of i want to work with computers
that is what makes this country great
i was getting to the point where i had to get up and walk around or i was going to fun asleep
he or she could then use the computer to listen to music
libraries in <location> i am going to write a persuasive essay about what i think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book
i also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help
the wind speed at that height is incredibly violent and would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast
you tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children
my final reason is also very helpful
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very relaxed and happy
the author never mentioned any negative activity in the memoir
when i am happy all i do is smile and laugh
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
first of all he explains how much he loves his parents
the features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclists anger
without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around
the geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle
but still you cant stop it that is like trying to get a dog to be a cat it just wont happen
practice <caps> you <caps> the <location> is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country
also there was nowhere that he could get water around him
like example they can read load and also they can do the same book with others words
<caps> by this hes understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because hell know what to expect
everyone is patient one time in their life
the next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so i could not ride again
the author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir
the only way a child would see them is only if you point them out
one reason we use computers is for pleasure
i cried myself to sleep for a week
no one got the hose that time
this tower would illuminate from the inside
if you did then your thinking about the positive side and not the negative
the concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because <organization> is my favorite band
but if it is they cant watch it
we cant not do in the real world
my dog instead of sitting runs at me jump and grabs the treat out of my hand
hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients
before we when it the door opened and its <organization> he wanted to say he loves us and good night
he grew up and actually met people and made friends
i was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet
i felt like shooting myself when ever some one caught another fish
she is grateful for all that her parents sacrificed to give her a better life
it gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too
they should be able to read anything they want
the reason i think that they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them
then the doctor walks in or dentist all there is is waiting and waiting
this point is a simple and logical one
<caps> appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a home
especially if they know that its something that could be debated about being censored
the author tries to let you know a home is more than physical walls it is a place for relationships are made
i think computers are good because you can talk to your friends and family on the computers
and do nothing except the computer
laughter is the shortest distance between two people
they contain many different styles and genres of books
it is all a part of growing up
so we take forever to drive there just sitting in the back sent all alone back there no one to talk to but my phone
peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless
even if some people get offended
computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they <month> just have
when it says they came
another feature that caused some problems for the cyclist were the run down ghost towns that consists of ramshackle sheds and several rusty pumps
when were together there is no stopping us
the author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story
i know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text
first comes the windy roads
this quote or textual evidence shows that the mood of the author is very warm and free
people are also in busy with there computers that they spend less and less time enjoying nature
but again the architects were presented with a problem
the most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy
after two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the <caps> <caps>
many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points <month> offend each other
they chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends
i this setting he used up his water and it was hot
to think that <caps> confidence came from just one comforting laugh seemed almost improbable
<caps> was getting extremely angry at <location> for taking so long
this part of his journey affects him the most
people find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone
people can look at information faster than ever with this device
when he talked about the different cultures and races coming together and becoming a solidarity made the <caps> feel welcome to everyone no matter what race you are
being patient payed off because if i would have bothered my mom too much she might have gotten mat at me
i should of be patient the whole day and maybe i would of participated in all the games
dirigibles are large steelframe balloons enclosed by cotton and filled with hydrogen and helium
her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well
throughout the story it says how she feels out of place just like the winter hibiscus
they want to fit each magazine personally to each individual
some how my dad deiced to pretend like we were in court
another person <month> enjoy that book and many others <month> like it as well
ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section
after reading this if have proven that my <caps> should be admired by many people
all of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then
it is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house
we use computers to purify water
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very satisfactory and interesting
you can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again
all you have to do is search your destination and pictures and info will come up so you can make the right choice
when the games over his mom takes us to <location> house
the wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen
also the author wrote much preferred it to the big mac
it was around <time> and we were all watching hills have eyes
finding things to laugh about can be a good way to relieve stress
the second reason is you can learn about far away places and people
i ended up waiting over twenty minutes until i saw one of the people that were playing
<person> says that using a computer helped you type
looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book
meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another
now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels
one would be grounding us
this meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles
it will pound and feel as if its on fire
authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process
people can not take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some
there are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel
her life will always be filled with music and love
should books that <month> be offensive to others no because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more
except the thing that they were about to do
the only other access to typing is a type writer
at the of the day i think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public
i found one that looked very interesting i got it and started to read it
there can be a lot to learn too
all these problems contributed to the mooring masts fate disuse
but the parents did make it to the united states
but then i see a person really enjoying their time at the library
all and all the dirigibles ran into a lot of people
a study conducted <caps> the <organization> shows that children that use the computer <num> hours a day are more obese then children who use it one hour or less a day
that effected me because when i heard it i went around people who were positive in my life saying it to them
that is just how they use there brains
and without warning i started laughing too
i had an amazing time dancing
you can even communication with friends
if there are books that talk about the discrimination on other races i think its simply showing history
laughing can have many different meanings
i knew my grades we be far worse
i made a quick phone call and ten minutes later i was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up
one thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes
we staid there until <time> then we left
he would now give me hugs in the hallway
i learned an important lesson that day
something about the story has a very happy feel to it
the features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located
us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys
there are plenty of sports players that are on twitter and they are fit
he was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said i found it
i was ignoring <person> calls <caps> texts
i totally agree on that
so i waited and then finally it was my birthday
the mood was also happy because its a very happy story
i went to <organization>
well when people think of softball they think of the pitcher
you cannot see how a character truly feels
people of all ages have the right to read any material that they want <caps> or other family members <month> tell their children not to read about a certain topic
i think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor
he probably thought i was a freak
the stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building
instead of being on the computer join a sports club
however there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed
music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do
like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days
later on after that fun model runway we decided to pillow surf down the stairs
each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics
the world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions
when the prince went on stage he called her name and she went on stage
that is just one example of how the humans mind can change
everyone being patient
interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life
we moved to go ask her mom
another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country
<caps> all started <date> in <date>
doing that is like putting duck tape on the writers mouth
this was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the empire state building was unsafe
so the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went
and this is only the beginning of what our lives would like without the computer
he thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family not just a home
we were sitting there for almost <num> hours not even making a sound
ill give you an example
which he can be very annoying
kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results
<caps> was the <date> i was fifteen and a sophomore at <organization> school
in the end i found out that she had burn my birthday cake trying to preheat the over for pizza
instead of letting the facts be the facts people want to adjust things so it is less offensive
if a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual technically by the law they have the right to do so
they do a great deal to help make our lives easier
they even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another
this show the love on which his parents did for him and for that he had a happy life
many adults are over weight because they sit at computers and work as play games all day
students need computers to help them complete homework and class projects
another obstacle was nature
there is a reason the rating is what it is
i do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading
first people will became antisocial
also most dirigibles outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium
they truly learned the real meaning of family
parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of <location>
the final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians
doing so will not only help libraries but also society
it is also an easy way to purchase items
the greatest reason was one of safety
well on one morning my mom had got out of work when she came i told my mum that i really wanned to go over my friends house
you can chat with people even if there is no one around
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast
in science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done
the next day <date> i cooked my mom some breakfast and i was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone
he writes his memoirs in loving spirits dedicating his knowledge of a family to his own
people are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else
you always have the choice to go outside and take a walk
the line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you so to me it felt like forever
you just need to get used to their surroundings
the essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction
which effects him because hes beginning to loose hope and thinks hes not going to make it
so i think some magazines should be removed off the shelves
the time had come for me to go with the dentist
this shows his love for his kitchen
he kept on trying and trying
a computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people
any way children become more social
it was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the buildings framework
<caps> <caps> <caps> in to the schools office was a usual thing for me
when we got in the car my mom took the wheel chair back and we where off
most recent information i would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact
it is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant
the <caps> they made
sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say
you have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person
that was like the icing on the cake of <time>
we decided to play all the video games at least once throughout that endless day
when <caps> telling about the apartment <caps> grow up in the mood is happy
the plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said
through out this memoir i think he has realized and is explaining what family really is and that he is grateful for having one
these are probably the is for school
these <caps> cards allow the person to have access to adults materials depending on the kind of card the person has
they help function machines
buy you a bike i ran so fast and hugged my dad and went and got dressed
that includes the variety of things humans are interested in
i really had no idea how <caps> felt about me
i answered his question with a hug and a yes and he brought out a banquet of roses
you wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer
this would make a parent cautious of where their child goes
the library has a section for adults
is mentioned in the last paragraph
by taking things off the shelfs that maybe other people like oppose to others then your taking that right away as a <caps> citizen
playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax
another obstacle was that dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is flammable
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
one <month> have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives
everyone should have a because you can play any types of game
someone can be really interested in them items and they come to the library search for them and cant find them
its to get students to have a good background of the computer
on the <caps> when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done
you can even watch fights <caps> you want
i saw the time of how long it would take to get to my house
i think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info
<person> shows his love for his heritage by stating my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills
the author uses verbal irony when calling it a town town having it not really be a town anymore
the entire steel frame of the building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast
other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is
soon enough they catch up with me and take me off my feet
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story
i apologized and explained that i was sick
this shows that she can still eat the foods she ate back at her old home and try new things at her new home
it was very cold in the waiting room plus i had <caps> on my wrist
you can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much i need laughter to keep myself together and from going insane
some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act
i also became close with <organization> and <caps>
<caps> <caps> my cell phone buzzes in my pocket
sometimes watching t
you can learn how to type really fast
so i realized that i can go on the computer at the library
phones are just a tiny version of a computer
we knew it at this point
this states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the empire state building
i personally think he was in fact born in the <caps>
he had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up
these are reason why computer could be a good devices
reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide
after two hours and a half while i am watching t
you can play games with people
i do not think those books should be on the shelves
knowledge is just seconds away
this are shown through the following quotes my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking
there was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had
so think about the decision you are making and <caps> <caps> will benefit our society or make our society <date> to its knees
when we got to the front of the line i was so scared that i was going to pee my pants
one of the first hands raised
another problem that was present was also the lack of safety
i guess i was afraid to show who i really was to her
there are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question
in front of our boy neighbor
he wanted to end the story on a positive note
that is how and why laughter has and is a important part in all and in every relationship to and for everyone
magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music
one of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell
this proves that he is grateful
one time i had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me
to me they are fun because when you are bored you can play games
another reason why computers are useful is because they help with handeye coordination
my beliefs wont be the same as yours but this is how i feel and this is how i will keep on feeling
those are some obstacles that the architects of the empire state building faced in an attempt to dock dirigibles
why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in <caps> world is beyond me
we were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called snow
then comes the <date>
still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer
the mood created in this article is a joyful mood
the builders of the empire state buildings mast were confronted with many obstacles to overcome
it was called the <caps> timbers
dear local news paper i think the computers benefits society
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
they are teaching our family apart
being able to laugh is good for you and your health
i told my dad maybe we should do this another day
the plant represents beautiful things and the geese represent beautiful things
and all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another
a specific situation happened when i was about nine years old
all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
the affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office
too much time on computer
this would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the empire state building
nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast
the computer is also a great device to use for learning
the author describes this i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
for example hunting you sit and wait for a deer to come
before we left our house i asked my <caps> if i could bring my <caps> <caps> <caps> <caps> with me so that i was not bored on the plane
otherwise people would complain just out of spite towards certain peoples material
it also might change who you are as a person
libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way
now theres many reasons to laugh or the type of laughter or the feeling behind it
<caps> lets you keep in touch with everything thats going on with things like status updates
thats how i learned my lesson to be patient
finally i went into take a shower
these are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries
well i am saying you should go on it and search were you want to go
the author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test
sense that day <person> and i have been glued to each others sides as best <caps>
not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human
all this was caused by the setting he was in
we all make a big deal over something so small
even if it was tied in the back would move
most office people have a computer to talk to others by email or to fix problems
we were racing <caps> boats that my dad had build
from sitting on your while on the <caps> every day you any calories or fat <caps> when you eat all your doing is gaining weight
so please take my opinion into consideration
another way it improves handeye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively
like in a restaurant you be patient and wait for your food
computers also help kids spell better
we jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on
the mooring mast on the empire state building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock
when it came time to take the picture at the end i was crying i was laughing so hard
they wanted a better life and education for their kids
the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure
their was a time when i was patient
well thats my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important
a week after <caps> the mail man came
this is the issue with taking books off the shelves
some other people <month> think differently
<caps> that mean that there were a happy and friendly family
computers inform people about important news
he made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and tested like battery acid
please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them
it was <date> <time> i had to go to school
another way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the authors opinions of the memories
the kind of laugh where tears run down a persons face
i thanked her and then completed my work
when she finds that place she will find herself ready to take the test or do things normally
after that we saw our cousins
work data and they help <percent> of businesses we file reports communicate with other branches of that company
materials should never be denied from the library
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
that is where places are trying to clean things up
we all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready
the winds are constantly changing which is dangerous for the dirigibles
also you can put clothes and other store products an hold
the mood i think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness
nobody wants to talk and a great way to present this
a thousandfoot dirigible moored atop the building would add enormous stress to the frame of the building
after i got the shirt we walked back in the line
those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality
you cant agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while
they simply fueled the fire
once i actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this i thought that it was a good idea
one of the obstacles the builders had was with the stress of the dirigibles load as said in the excerpt in paragraph <num>
well others <month> find things offensive that the other person does not
she wanted to make the best of things with what she had
the desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one
say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading
i always wanted to go to <organization> because they had a play structure
in my <caps> l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad
she missed being home so much because nothing was the same
once the automatic doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section
people yell at first
this idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home
the obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety
if you spend all of your time on the computer doing whatever your doing you wont have time to go out and exercise
this shows that computers give terrible effects on society
as an <num> using <person> as well in school
this way children would not be able to go to older peoples section
religion is one thing that history books can really raise offense to people because it could have some of the facts wrong about that type of religion
not for anything bad
then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off
another thing you could do is make videos
this is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves
i celebrated my first birthdays
this story is about a time when i was patient
she questioned <caps> with a worried look on her face
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very cool and funky
when he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers
not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments
when we got there my mother signed all three of us in on the sign in sheet then we had to sit and wait
another obstacle that was faced was that dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium which was extremely flammable
also my mom and my dad went with me and my sister to the doctor
for five minuets he was laughing
its not that kindness is a bad way to make friends
you can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games
this is where the offensiveness comes from
lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink
this shows that even a students are getting bad grades from being on the <caps>
the wait will be a minimum of <num> hours
we were at <caps> <caps> setting up for her party
<caps> talks about how his neighborhood consisted of many races
as the words rolled off his tongue <caps> began to stutter
the setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally
an obstacle that the builders faced was providing safety
i was patient when my birthday came
people like playing video games or be on websites that they like
i strongly believe that they have bad effects on people
i had to get in a wheel chair
it says in the excerpt that these was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
there are so many reason why people might think some things are offensive
there is an obvious pattern
the dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people
the features of a setting can clearly affect people
he also loved being with his family
many have heard of that
he achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation
the old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years
another problem with docking blimps on the empire state building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas
i think that <caps> is fine if you take them out
libraries should have whatever they want in the library
the temperature caused the cyclist to sweat
some book such as <caps> <caps> <caps> and <caps> <caps> <caps> are great to read for school assignments
the builders came up with a plan that included what the mast would have to be made of and what wold be on each floor
<caps> i have a good day or a good weekend i laugh a lot
they should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
a parent <caps> supposed to help their child grow and learn right from wrong
a story of being patient a kid wakes up
sometimes it is harder to ignore
this really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder
now i regret not getting together with her to hang out
it would be dangerous to have an unstable dirigible hanging above crowded city streets
were always laughing and making jokes
i went to find my brother i left when i do it my mothers house cried the woman
think about the conversations that go on in schools and at the work place
wed sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying
it is better to laugh then to be sad
i got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home
my mom called and told us she was running a little late and she would be here after she get my cake
we first tried to put <person> through the window
just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also
the little kids that are hungry were showing patience than the angry adults
they were like family to all of us and no one wanted to see them go
i think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable
people use the <caps> everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television
this shows that in order to have the ship still enough to be able to moor it was dangerous
and how important he learned that family and friends are
the best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boys
the heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired
since i am a teen i also know the problems with youths and computers
well i can tell you why
builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there
this entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting
the first obstacle they faced was placing the mooring mast on the building
she is very happy for all the things she has and she admires her parents for their love and sacrifices they took
computers help people keep in contact with others
your family can make parties
these people get made at that and they will just give up
this sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime
in my life laughter has helped me threw the hardest situations and made them a lot better
he knew that many immigrants risked everything to come raise their children in <location> and for that he is thankful
the story states i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
she went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her
the mood created by the <caps> in the memoir is happy
removing this items would just be a total chaos
people of any age should be able to check out any book they please
you wont have to wait for school the next day you can talk to them through the computer
this is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class
i am going to tell you how they are wrong
books are good for people
there would soon be nothing left
so tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries
she was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was i
i <caps> we all can with a little sense of humor
there are a few ways to describe the mood the <caps> created in this memoir
a computer is constantly updated with new facts about everything
and that you are architect you can make your proper work or house you see the computer is so cool
the builders of the empire state building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the buildings dirigible mooring mast
computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations
computers are so much easier to use than books
the game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done
because many people even young children can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn
everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age
the bad part is that these exports think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers
the second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play
those are all reasons why i had to be patient on are <num> hour drive to <organization> town
movies should stay in a movie store of at the movie theater
lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers
i think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
they now have planes that can be flown by a man far away and this would save there lives even if it gets shot down
to read them well thats what i thought
you could understand more about plants and animals
this expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him
the media is a way for some people to get out and reach others
libraries everywhere should have most everything there is
i think that computers are good
the load would cause stress
computers are also fun
i think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people
it got even worse when it froze up a week later
also shows the man was very thirsty
it felt like forever
some people a completely patient
i would make her keep going
passing each other in the hallway just would make my <date>
the mood changed throughout the memoir
everyone should be interacting with someone
i understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people
that paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles
that is why i believe computers benefit society
to prevent kids from sneaking behind your back
so leaving <person> and <person> to change i waited outside <person> room
laughing is one of the best way to just relax
you would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people
a lot of it is especially not for young children
especially things like computers
in this memoir there <month> have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created
another reason to use a computer is a for research
and the last con of censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning a book brings
we all have different opinions on what good music or movies are
she is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home
libraries need to realize that
the biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building
my brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow
let me explain why computers can ruin lives
people use computers to communicate with people far away
without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work
its hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular
thank you for your time
laughter cheers up my friends when they are feeling down
we still are best friends
this drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive
but at <organization> it a good source of <caps> for them
they have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want
school is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things
other people might like it or they might like it themselves if they give a chance
there is nobody to tell them what is wrong and right so some kids might not know
if people avoid their computers then we could be one of the fittest countries
the first girl asked
computers effect a lot of people
but as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland
