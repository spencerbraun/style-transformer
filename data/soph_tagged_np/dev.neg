we got here around <num> in the <time>
he thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted
the flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments
we decided to play marco polo
say that you have family members that live in <location> or <location> you can keep in touch with them by email or video chat
being obese is terrible for your health
the empire state building is known as the worlds tallest building
these websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily
this is where he had memorized his cultures distinct type of food
the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting
you can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in <organization>
now no one has to get in a car and go visit any one else
it was a bright and sunny <date> <time>
but we see people get hit by cars all of the time on the <caps> and it is considered comedic
my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers
it will be a new start for me and my life wont be the same anymore
be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even
some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people
i will be writing a true story in which laughter will be one important part
magazines <month> also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way
the last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination
i interact with my friends <percent> of us population between the ages <num> have a <caps>
letting them grow up as innocent as possible
there i was so mad i could have killed
when people get computers they spend more time inside and on them
<caps> like these swirled in my head
i guess all that waiting really payed off
<person> was blessed that he had his house
if we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs things will get out of control
the dirigibles would constantly be moving and shifting
a chorus of laughter filled the air
another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself
only to quickly realize that it was only her fist
the empire state building was already standing in the architects decided to renovate and make a dock for dirigibles
an author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders
i think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times <person> had in his house
she said i cant have one till <num> grade unless i get a <caps> phone write now and cant till ninth grade to get a real phone
they just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie
spending time with family is way more important then going on the computer with friends
the human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology
most importantly they are a vital source of communication
because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things thats the book does
hes also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old mens directions
you can get help in school work also
the obstacles the builders faced were too many and this project soon became impossible to finish and it never was
thats why the computer
another one is the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation
the very computer you <month> love can harm you
this made the trip extra hard and discouraging
they get all couped up inside for the whole day
i believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials
in my opinion that was patience
the <caps> has many fun gaming websites such as <caps>
the obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles
overall the project was just doomed to fail from the start
so yea the last sentence he said i liked it
i feel that books should stay on the shelf however
i will talk about why i disagree with this statement
the mood the author set was warmth and happiness
thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say
and finally we were in <location>
the computer is very smart and is probably the best technology invented
so i get back in the driver seat and we are all yelling get in the car but she laughing really hard saying i wet my pants
there are some that need to be clean up
i remember it like if it was just last week
he kept saying i know he is in there
immediately <person> ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we <caps> we got home that night
they could play a variety of games
censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate
in making this huge building there were many obstacles
i remember that morning i felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time
<caps> me fun was doing stuff i normally would not do
right away i start to laugh
another reason the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful is that the author understands his parents hardships
in the story construction workers faced a problem
it <month> be the readers
they all ate lunch at the school and got pizza or sub sandwiches
this made it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building
a third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people
that is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe
i say that because people look at magazines that have shooting in then and that have crime in them to
reading books could give people more things to talk about
i believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope
another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
after a we all had swam around for a bit we decided to go of the rope swing
i was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age
patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant
mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles
magazines are good for a couple of different nice things
this is not what i want to happen though
laughter can create this type of bond thats hard to sever
there are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing
you wont go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday
it was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple
there is always a choice of what to do and what not to do
also the computer can save alot of important things you need
he laughed so hard his eyes started to water
<caps> they came down the hallway i could hear there foot step
he was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal
a lot of times you could be watching <caps>
there are many great effects computers have on and for people
movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older
patients is a sort of a gift
i think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades
i loved those earphones they were blue my favorite color
the first reason being what maybe offensive to you <month> not be to someone else
when somethings really funny i usually have a hard time to get another gasp of air because i cant stop laughing
if i was a administrator in a <organization> i would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express
i have been patient many times in days
<caps> i cant either
when we finally got there my <caps> made me wait and unpack
another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything
because once they are gone then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because of the books that they find interesting are gone
i was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first
computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework
he called it a substance it had a flavor of battery acid
the builders had to go through many obstacles to <caps> to allow the dirigible to dock on the <organization>
if the person spoke fluently in <caps> and <caps> than he or she could teach you
there are some material that a adult <month> need to help in life
it would be all the more reason for him to give up
another reason is that it was just not safe to dock these massive blimps that high
he was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him
<caps> is the key to their future
attempted screams came out as muffled moans
we will not learn the new ideas that authors put out there for us if people just keep getting offended and taking them off the shelves
missed the first bus the caught the next one
and that was the time i was patient
i told her that some guys asked me if we have cars in <location>
<caps> to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest
<caps> makes any task difficult because the sun drains a persons energy
there was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal
that way you could finish your story in time
laughter for me is what starts a friendship if i can make someone laugh we are already closer then when we first said <caps>
another example is when it says tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me
<caps> responded with patience and years of practice
some people <month> like the content it shows
the last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas
i love my little sister <caps>
well hope you like the way i put the words in my story so by and see you next time
this was the first obstacle which affected him
computers give you all that
<caps> my uncle <person> said
the wind coming off of other building would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed
i finally said i love you girl
i have used patience many times
i tell myself what am i forgetting
the last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law
i was controlling the big boat the only boat with a motor <person> towing behind us was the canoe
ill give you <num> reasons
said <person> our health teacher
this is how to use mood correctly
we could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers
if a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them
either its a law or the parents have made it a rule
are offensive then you really got to take action
we were told it was irresponsible and childlike
the builders of the empire state building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
so the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him
the second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect
all i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it
we had become friends
sometimes we she take a break from them and enjoy nature
with others made of helium
everybody has a different way of what keeps them close to a friend so i think its different for everybody
when i have children i will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them
no i disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use
my grandpa ever so kindly offered to go pick her up but then i mentioned that <caps> and i could go do it
i believe that computers benefit society
we both thought that <person> and <person> were never hanging out with us
for all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job
the author uses words such as warm to describe things
i do not believe computers benefit society
thats the way id be getting when ever id get bothered at him
so these were <caps> reasons or some bad effects computers could have on people if your not go outside to do some activities or to hang out with some friends
my mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister
let them find out about stuff when they ask a question
in the tent that <time> we were so tired everything seemed funny to us
she feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test
i stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by <caps>
these laughing experiences have turned our unclenephew relationship into a friend relationship
he setting made the cyclist feel lonely
the only slight bit of worry for trouble was one of the friends became behind on his task of finding hotels and places to stay for everyone
a time when i was patient is when i was at food store waiting for my food
in conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future
the author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown
the door moaned as <person> began to place the tip of his <caps> lightup sneaker onto the roan colored carpet in his parents bedroom
the builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the empire state building
one reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues
this showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat
that is so important because a computer could do a lot
magazines are not really a problem
another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas
being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration
in <caps> i had to stand in front of the class to give <caps> conclusion
were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity
you wont be patient with your boss when you get a job
<person> rolled her eyes and re gripped her pillow and blankets
fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw <person> riding in the back of someones old <organization> truck
the builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast
we got settled into ground blind at about <num>
that is why the author concludes that statement
i <caps> the culture and how you need to appreciate what you have
they would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about <person>
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where the many things i learned there about how to love
this was an example of how it helped me and my best friend become friends and stay friends through everything life has thrown at us
she said and that was the <date> thing she said to me until we reached our destination
nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read
though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages
workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment
the designers had such big plans for the building that reality was far off
at the bottom was <caps> signature
i laughed thinking how did i not know that
campfire that <time> was a hoot
why bore yourself to death with computers that will probably give you the wrong advise when you could always ask a friend for advise
too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday
computers give people a place to interact with others
that is why i think that computers help develop a smarter brain
i explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details
the last main obstacle of the empire state buildings builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas
then we took turns napping and watching the big open road
our <caps> grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named <caps>
another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying its safety
also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored
my first reaction was to use my nervous laugh
she will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted
studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well
<person> hand shot straight up in the air
the computer has helped us first make a model of our invention then we start making the details
the jets went over us and the <organization> was going
<num> out of <percent> of kids agree with <caps> science teacher <person>
an hour past by it was still raining
i think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves
we learned this in paragraph <num> when the author states a thousandfoot dirigible moored at the top of the building
another way <caps> shows <caps> is grateful is <caps> says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
i think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read
but not everyone agrees that this benefit society
life in itself can be an opinion
i learned this during a visit to the dentists office
it was the <date> and we lived just around the corner
there was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area
its not using time wisely
she was sad <caps> weeks had passed and <caps> was the beginning of a new school year
<caps> <organization> <caps> giggled before <caps> said her name
it will not be safe for the pedestrians below the empire state building
banning books would go against what our country stands for
they <month> use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages
also computers can save you time and money now
so thats when we went to my moms room and used the bathtub and put the hose all the way out the back door
so my mom got home drove me and we ended up a hour and a half late but my <caps> was still very patient
it is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone
it was a very good statement
one time my volleyball team went to <organization>
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
i believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work
she said it was <caps>
she was patient because every single time i asked for something she got it without complaining she just did what i asked her to do
we both are very fun and outgoing people
they can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life
thinking to my self i hurried to get my clothes packed for the week
lastly kids can learn about people from other times
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships lying too low over urban areas
if a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material
there are just to many people in this world and i have read articles about libraries
we have so many fun memories together
censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the <location>
secondly i think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states
i think they should be able to keep them
thats why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the empire state building
these are important things that help me keep up with things away from my town
all the facts of life and the world are put into it
the owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area
thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials
they let us talk to friends and family around the world
my mom said that shed be wide back
there are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong
i guess i never believed laughter is the shortest distance between two people
in paragraph <num> it says the winds on top of the building were constantly moving
he knows it was hard for his parents to leave their country for him
you have three people on the roof of <organization> <organization> scoping out the road and you have four <caps>
<caps> i looked at her like <caps> was crazy
recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination the more enjoyable it is
also another obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around
it was <num> and my bedtime is <num> so i had to hurry up
my father i have yet to see
i believe laughter is an important part of any relationship
there are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed
so i say we as in the <location> citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of
<date> i went to bed i asked once more and again she said no
one of these obstacles was the mooring mast itself
when we stopped there i got inside a shopping basket and my friends and i were racing down the isles and maid all the other costumers laugh
this can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away
another obstacle the architects had to work with was putting the mooring mast up on the building
i was walking into the room where the speech competition was
a religion a person might be it might offend you
winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it
the author creates a special mood in this memoir
exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit
we sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes
all you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you
that is just another example why the computer has a positive effect
many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend
you can see where its going just by looking at the screen
instead of a patience
patients is about many things
i would not want my <num> year old kid read a book with bad language in it
he could have died from heat stroke and lack of water
you might even find a lady bug
i believe people should not be able to censor books
some people just have to deal with these people
it <caps> simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting
spring is when the snows melt and geese return
eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief
were part of a movement that will last forever
everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like
i helped other people
it helps the police and <caps>
the girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes
this shows how he loved his home
the feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist
you can sign up for jobs right on your computer
its not the writers fault
it would cause a conflict of two different sides
she talks about how her parents helped others of their kind which made her what she is today
i inhaled and headed down the hall to them
<num> problems on each side
the computer is great if you have to do research
so if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside
they help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done
most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents
all of these reasons contributed to why docking dirigibles would come with many obstacles
the reason is that benefits society
this once again made me feel sad and depressed
a huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas
the answer is patience
two more things affected the cyclist
the picture came out
she mentions that her parents raised her well and they made it seem like they were a extremely great family
i was supposed to be one of the first people out of my group of friends who was going to get there permit
and then we have no book left on the self for any of us
you can make a difference in the way people feel about computers
i think this <caps> is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was
another obstacle was nature
as <caps> all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another
libraries have books and magazines that is for children and also for adults and even grandparents
in conclusion there are many people that <month> or <month> not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion
so when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out
this climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert
for a long time it was hope you will read
for the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre
i think the memoir has a happy and grateful mood
computers teach handeye coordination and they let you communicate with other people
there immune system making the risk of getting sick greater
using computers has been very helpful to our society
things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence
finally in the last paragraph the very last sentence says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions
but their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff
another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides too you
we were outside this talking to each other
it is how others think about what is out there in these libraries not what you think
it was hard enough for the builders to build the empire state building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top
it is alright to not agree with another person says but everyone does have the right to stand up and say what they think about the situation
the <caps> had to modify and strengthen the building to accommodate the new situation
that is how laughter brought <person> and i to be best <caps>
but a child laughs <caps> you make a funny face or <caps> an animal does something funny
i have a few reasons also <caps> i think there should not be censorship in libraries
the greatest reason the mooring mast of the empire state building never fulfilled its purpose was because of safety issues
is a moment that is remember by many people
the <caps> <caps> of the <location> <location> <caps> <location> that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press
were all born with the ability to laugh
<caps> let out a yawn and moved his kings knights pawn up two squares and hit the clock
besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed
like at <time> i saw my cousin and she gave me <money> for my birthday
once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting
removing the material might frustrate and offend the author or other readers
now thats just my opinion
another situation was working at <location> this <date>
the first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert
some talk about nonfiction and some fiction
i woke up just like any other day happy yet lacking sleep
its so hard not to feel better when laughing
if someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others
next it was time to gear up and put my helmet on
now its a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water
we rely on such things <num> to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught
i have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than i could have ever done
with his parents giving up everything from their past just to start a family with a better life
the purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource
people should use a <caps> more often
in this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time
this means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the governments or the citizens opinions
so who am i to tell another person what they can and can not do
this is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places
yet some people refuse to accept computers are now apart of every day life
computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle
books that are bad should be taken off the shelf
he came to the united states in 1956
we sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started eating
people can go there for many different things
at first none of us really skated cause we were looking around
and bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm <date> grass
we have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way
there are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands
i know that you can break free from it because i once experienced the same thing
we were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile
i asked my mom when we got to the hotel can i go swimming
when she is on she ignores everything around her
a material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it
also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed
i was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film only bits and pieces of it
he felt grateful and thankful for his parents love and sacrifice
students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work
the pond was not so nice in the fact that it was very littered with ducks ans geese and of course their droppings as well
they could also not be spending time with family
we had one class together
one of the main reasons why i think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it
there are offensive stuff all over the world so you cant avoid it every where you go
my older sister <person> was having a baby
i was next i sat on the seat the sun was right on me
she will always love her grandma
this probably should have been considered
that is exactly <caps> happened that night i regret
i used to think that talking with someone
all these safety troubles and violations would all together make the mooring an impossible feat
this <caps> though was one where our laughter made the largest impact
if you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninetyfive percent voted to get rid of that book then i think it would be okay
that example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature
my mother came over here when she was <num>
my friends and i had the biggest fight over the littlest reason
the report had to be over the <date> and slavery
they also gave educational games
the law stated that airships flying to low over urban areas was prohibited
it made me really happy to see them getting along
i tackle <caps> sister <caps> the ground
also he is running out of water
in conclusion you live a happier life when explore the
or listen to music there are websites for them also
<caps> all of paragraph <num> is about how grateful he is to his parents
the law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas
much like one time we were at cedes
i have never been there so i want on the computer
being happy and laughing with people makes a really strong connection between people
i trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people
the hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming
it can be useful to both adults and children
they hurried up and closed the door and told me to go up stairs
a lot of people are religious and their particular religion <month> be against looking at suggestive and unholy material
thanks for taking the time to read this
in the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways
one last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly to low over the urban areas
the best true story that i could tell you that involves me and laughter is about my dad and i
this symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will
we do everything together and we always have each others back
computers also can provide fun games and entertain users
you want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean
stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out
i like <caps> magazines
i will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works
i think some people just have to live with it
i had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen
only if they are doing what the parent says
<caps> said <caps> for you baby
sat in the car for at leas <num> mints but the train showed an signs of ending
patience helped me because i know in the future to be tolerant
the reason it being in such a remote area did not help
the hidden information could be helpful
there are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else
first they allow you to chat with friends they allow you to message anytime you want
this quote shows that <person> is thankful for a nice place to call his home
another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas
in contemns i was patience
we stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other
and third he was traveling through the deserts
laughing is also good for the body
computers seem to be the talk of the year
thats an example of being obsessed with a computer
there it is <person>
staring at that <num> inch little screen can damage your eyesite
it shows your comfortable with the person and are having fun also
kids and adults was singlehanded
four months later it was finally time to go
the effects of what <month> come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read
spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer
many people would agree that using a computer helps us learn new things
i had waited patiently all year counting down the days till <date> reading books and homework where almost done with for another year
the final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building
a time when i was patient is last year when my dad took me hunting
its all there right at your fingertips
i go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax
this is a time when <person> needed to show patience
i believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials
religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves
my aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work
more and more people keep getting sucked into the amazing things that computers can do and forget all about the other more important things in life
children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open mindedness and acceptance of others
they do this hundreds of a day
our media is too intertwined with our lives
most simple things make me laugh more and be happy
i felt determination flow through my veins
it really felt like she was acting as if i never was a part of her life
so the people in the car come up closer and they are laughing so hard that we can hear them before we can even see who it is
reading material can help a young person with life
i then tolled my mom that <person> were going to find a place to sit
she was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow
the cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more
he ends up getting lost
i hope you can agree with me
sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book <month> help the other person
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness
i love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup <organization> hot chocolate
sorry thanks for being patient
i hope you are agree with my ideas
i know the some movies are horrible just like <caps> <caps>
they just need to have learning and for fun magazines
life is going to be hard unless your patient
music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store
when only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more
is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer
we sat their for <num> to <num> minutes but it seemed like an hour
<caps> you can playing games with people from ground the world
an he appreciates him because of the same thing i said before he admires them and always thank them for what they have done to her
so their for i think spending a lot of time on a computer is bad
soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor
thats the kind of question my brother was curious about
the author of the memoir is thankful of her parents and to the rest of her family
i know that after a long time on the computer i have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad
this form of bulling has happened to many and we have lost many to it
the book i found was a book called <caps> <caps> by <person>
so from that point on he was always patient for the rest of his life
patience is usually good or bad for me
they are intended for people of all ages
after all the world is a very diverse place and we were not all made the same
some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other
adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them
plus i get lost because they leave me
my last reason is you can make <location> friends
the winds caused the dirigible to move too much that it became unsafe to use
she was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students
my mom said again that i have to be patient
these obstacles were not easily fixed
this can make families keep in touch and friend close
young children need books to help their imagination grow
all types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries
censorship happens everywhere you are
<person> feeling that way made <location> and i feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there
taking offensive books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech
<person> cleaned up the best she could but there was almost no use
but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town
a good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last
books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone
one such obstacle was safety
the greatest obstacle was said to be nature itself
when the cyclist arrived at the abandoned <caps> grape factory he felt on twist of many
computers are also needed to do research for school projects
i was getting pretty discouraged
and that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork
we wait for hours till it was finally our turn
any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage
the mood of this story is very positive
learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday
this shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that
i think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again
into a computer to add beats and different vocals
slavery and the <person> were a horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again
those are the names of my identical twin cousins <organization> i can honestly admit that they are <num> of the funniest kids i know
sitting at home on the couch eating a bag of potato chips
he had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit
if kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it
and to me that shows love thats why i think the author created love as his mood in the memoir
finally we came to the front of the line
computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that wont get lost
the human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more
sometimes you need take a break and slow down
then lack of water began
other than a little midnight prank
then i saw a doctor who can cure people only by laughter
you can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper
there are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about
<caps> i guess its not that far away from here
many people believe that laughter can improve your life
lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful
one of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter
we finally made it to our destination key wrap
another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind
censorship of <caps> of <caps> all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
libraries are places of learning
also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you
if you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for
labeling books clearly with any suggestive content the book <month> contain would help this issue tremendously
it changes from flat road to short rolling hills
libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted
i believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclists condition
the reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place
my surrogate grandparents
hacking was <caps> become a world wide sport
a lot of people in the world today are having this same question
computers <month> take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it
thats when it all came to me i saw the whole scene once again i felt horrible
the first problem they faced was redesigning the buildings original skeleton to fit the needs of the mooring mast
thats why i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
everyone has their own favorite book or genre
but some tell you what age it is suitable for
just the thought of not being down there with them made me ill
it was ironic because the germs would be preserved in the ice box it was funny i was keeping my germs alive and my mom used that ice
one reason the mood is happy is because of the setting
i was so happy that i could be so patience for so long
weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below
the call ended and i was smiling from ear to ear
another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their biological parents or siblings
the fashion of the <num> and <date> is just a project i did last month
the author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons
some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate
it is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over
after the meeting we went to <person> craft store
the aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in
since i did not the website all i got to play was checkers on the computers but one day logged onto it and played my first driving computer game
discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day
this law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area
with this mindset i proceeded into the conference room for the first time since <person> had left
it could be the elderly all the way down to toddlers
what laughter is all <caps> laughter is the shortest distance between two people
<person> uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home
that is what i think respectful way
something in us changed that we could be a little closer
it is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole
they are <caps> because they get start a new life over
the lady at the front desk called me up
after the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean
they also hold your information
the hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply
there are so many varieties to choose from
the reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it
tumble weed usually means desert
i wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer
<caps> were the obstacles
my opinion on this subject is its not right
laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship
another obstacle was safety
for one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and <date>
there has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast
the more insight you can feel about a persons feelings the more laughter you can find deep inside a individuals well being
it was staring me right in my face so i i talked to my grandparents and said we could stay
finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated
as he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere
it had to go <num> minutes without thunder for the game to resume
it also says that there was always a feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced
if you wrote a book and people did this to you how would you feel
we were shooting across the isle from table to table trying to dodge people walking by
each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter
socializing over computers <month> not be as effective as socializing in person but it gives the quieter people
a time to retake the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon
you can have conversations with all your friends and family
now the content of some books are not always appropriate
their schedule could be chaotic
i sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter
in the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring
well its true and computers are a great source <organization> <caps>
magazines under my arm i choose a seat in the far corner to wait in
one obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area
<caps> you want to live a long healthy life you need to get up from the computer and exercise
or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off
also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore
as a student i know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives
that is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends
the reason why i say <num> is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong and you can handle it if is wrong
my first impression of him was his cute smile
another one too small so he threw it back
my dad said that we were going shopping to get my xbox
this caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die
wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe
lots of critics say that a computer is not educational
my brother came in and woke me up and said that everyone was out in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed
people that do not think they are offensive will read them
i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work
computers and laptops should be network disconnected to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building
she sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it
it is human nature to fear the unknown
the architects of the empire state building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their
maybe next birthday <caps> can uninvited them
the <organization> should never be allowed to decide what the public views
lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away
the author shows a calm mood when he says always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love
once a week we email our penpa
first of all he rides into barren land
it stated that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
one way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the authors past memories
there are ups and downs either way it goes
i would get it cause thats what children do explore
the greatest obstacle builders faced was nature
she means that her parents sacrificed to turn a <num> room apartment into her home
we need to preserve through every problem we go through in life
even if you and call some one they <month> not be home or answer
they keep coming up with more and more
a tear leaked out of the corner of eye
they came selflessly this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were
in the story it says that my parents turned this simple house into a home
and you can tell hes trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle
he tried to jump on the front forks <caps> missed and fell
when the architect added a 185 foot spiral to the top of the building
i paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus
but i mostly think about me
and so there the <num> of us were standing there
might also be sending money by going to the computer and be sending to their family members
restrictions on renting that material could be set
my favorite thing is that my parents use email to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents
one time i was patient for the doctors and i had a great time
laughter lightens mood and makes you feel more happy
i have never seen her so patient it was no believable
i know people like to think that they know everything there is to know just because they have their own ways and thoughts
some of the movies and books people find offensive can be pretty bad and say nasty things and stuff like that
their would be a change in kids education
we then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself he <month> never get to do again
the last reason that blimps could not be docked at the empire state building was that there were laws against aircrafts flying that low
people should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy
but she had herself much preferred it to a big mac
one problem was the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve
also they can spend more time doing things with their kids
it simply could not be read if it is not available
this allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others
laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much
i am now an employee for <organization>
so maybe things do need to be taken off shelves
one time i was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for about at least <num> hours
i smiled to myself and as i closed my eyes i imagined all of the laughter i would get to enjoy with these friends
the author describes the many things her parents have given to her
they were not going to take that risk
news <caps> took a pull and said more than half of <location> schools are now using computers to put homework on to save paper
all of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same
having libraries censor things would make people feel left out
<caps> carried her things to the door
if people could limit their at risk for diabetes
they were full <caps> and she wanted to bake something traditional for them
a time i was patience was when my family went to <caps>
i have to be patient every thanks giving
without computers people could not learn new things
but when i got older i was more patient
the hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes
since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty
before computers were made all people bad was their family
computers are a more positive thing than negative
the builders of the empire state building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles
nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing
it will take longer to get a reply but its still worth the wait in the end
sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people
it was an unwise decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building
i m on my way with food i said oh
over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent
there are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by
those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office
my third and last reason is to be organized
they had hope in their children when they came to <location> to have great and prosperous lives
in paragraph <num> it says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
they want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so
i once spent <num> hours on my computer on <caps>
we should never have the right to be able to remove these materials
i hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what i have said
<organization> techniques and how to research any topic
they danced to this song a few other times that <date>
libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed
the setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way
lastly he is grateful to have grown up in a really good home
i think computers definitely have a positive effect on people
you can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away
thats the time i was patient
<person> was too busy laughing and trying to breath to tell <caps> how stupid i was
another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the empire state was nature itself
the members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled
one time when i was patient my friend <person> went to the mall around <num> am
and yes weight loss surgery does have effects such as death
they love all their friends and family and celebrate with then no matter what
not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically
<caps> people use computers for work
if i have the right to remove that book
we not even be able to communicate with some others
there is no one like <person>
that is a story about how i am patient
my cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets his way
if there were no computers i would have to use a typewriter and if i made a mistake i would have to type the whole thing again
i laugh a lot throughout the day
well thats fun and all for a few hours but some people spend a lot of time on there
one mood the author gives is a happy one
the empire state building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles
i run over pick it up and dash inside tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man
the authors gave the decision to choice between books or items
a good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them
the path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight
<num> out <num> <caps> either have no backyard or have nothing better to do
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
i always thought how the human body works is incredible
if your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer
just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home
modifications would have to be made to the entire building
the kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group
most children are addicted to computer games
i know one of my friends love to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time
being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant
we were laughing because it was so cute that <organization> thought <caps> dad was in the <caps>
to land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds
when i got home i had learn two lessons one was not to worry about anything and i learn how to have patients
those are the obstacles that the architects of the empire state building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there
i told you that you guys would love <caps>
that will affect me in very negative way
my parents turned this simple house into a home
ill describe more of what i mean in the following letter
when you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip
it was probably the best time of that <date>
they came selflessly
other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move
for the reason that its their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all
the hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination
there would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated
and its whatever they believe in is how it should go
teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed
he always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long
<num> more groups got called
and to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something
but when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends
if thats not the case then parents should keep them away from the content
to me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying
when we got to <location> we went on every ride in the park
finally the computer is a great place to find information and enlighten yourself
you can also talk to people on them
he sad when i tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid
the problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
the library should keep certain books at the library such as the bible and collage books
learning about other places is fun
i began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave
they should be aloud to be removed because some books are offensive
you cant help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch
well we went there because my dad was making a golf coarse
it was very cold and it was even snowing
they have censored movies just sitting there
a <num> and final reason i think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family
maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone
a second problem is shown in the quote the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
this will come off offensive to many men and women
censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for
the mood that is created by this story is admiration
finally they help people to keep in touch and meet knew people
to overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame
that magazines purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy
and maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer
the people would not be the only thing out of hand
another obstacle faced was the brutal winds which occur at such a high altitude
i will tell you about a time wen i was patient
thats a time i was patient
no one spoke on the ride home
one kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends
there are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities
on the website you can talk with anyone on your friends list
i know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone
because they help people learn about faraway places
chats rooms are cool to
i got out a piece of play doe and i made it into the <caps> i put it on the top of the tower
after phoning the school we discovered that my bus had been in a minor accident so i had to be driven to school that day
the answer in the question world war <caps>
its part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us
some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf
the plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her
just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same
as every day people are getting in touch with technology they are losing touch with the world around them
there are better entertainment active and will keep us healthy and exercising
when <organization> came inside he looked in every room and could not find <caps> dad
it was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful
computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily
they wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life
it was seven in the <time> when we left the rink
that is why i have patience
com and all types of past <caps> would show up
the hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her
censorship should not be allowed in libraries
we all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time
we both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like
keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this
exercise is important to your body and computers are not
thats why i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
this shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are
to <caps> a <caps> is a classic example of this
one of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a cable tether then stress would be put on the buildings frame
the violent air currents and high winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely tether itself to the top of the empire building
sometime those things are peoples life and all they do
the cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
i did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late
is extremely accurate for most
<caps> mood is caring my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family
you never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around nondomesticated animals
your should be <num> or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad
<caps> i agree that that would be fun
he also says that they have done a more courageous thing than he could ever do
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
another time where computers are handy is at tax time
it was the violent winds
one obstacle was nature itself
your relationship involves love and laughter
it was <num> am and my dads favorite music was on <caps> we stayed and watched the whole movie
there are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph
hes so on the <caps>
the sad truth is that it never happened
<caps> is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in
creates a good relationship
that mall was crowded
also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the <organization> flat roof
now that is a big difference
wed always have each others back for everything
my perfect day was on a <date> in the middle of <month> in <date>
and these books should not be censored in public and school libraries
before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers
with ease i glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right
the pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves
this intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men
the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced attempting to make the dock for dirigibles
<person> skips off to the woods
the <caps> talks about how it is hard for him and his parents to leave without the rest of there family
another thing they might do <caps> go to a website that could help them find affordable
the cyclist continued on desperate for water
i had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my <caps> <person> cheeks
give your computer a break
i can remember one <date> when my friends and i decided to go camping at a lake for a week
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
<caps> third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with teamworks and team building skills
and then walk away and say <caps> <caps> <caps> to <caps> wait and be patient
so i have to be very patient the other three hundred and fifty one days
its your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much
over <percent> of <caps> have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with
laughter is necessary to survive in this crazy and beautiful world
all the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used
<caps> obviously thought the new girl was weird
many features of the setting affected the cyclist
it was our new story <caps> tell everyone and we were both proud of it
everyday i spend at least <num> our writing something up for school
so either way it would not have been able to happen
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
he says the average grade for kids with a computer is an a
laughter can also change your emotion from mad to happy in an instance
the settings have a huge affect on the cyclist
nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast
even <caps> we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing
all the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell
laughter at its <caps> laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has
this last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful
it is grateful in a few ways
now people of all ages can use it for all different kinds of things
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
he started going really fast and i was flying every which way going in circles
imagine you working on a project in school
there are several things that explain why i think this
we were in writing class and there was a boy named <caps> sitting between us
so then they call there buddies and say lets try this and most of them do then there in trouble
the children just need to stay in there own age levels
a computer is a great thing to have for all these things
so they can play games with people from around the world using a computer
throughout the next two weeks i saved money up for six flags
it comes to my attention that computers have over time
finally the day came and my parents were driving me to her house
he is doubtful that he will make is journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy
these obstacles are what builders of the empire state building faced
some experts are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers
<person> knew <person> had recently broken up with her boyfriend
over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework
computers do have an effect on people
one of everyones favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment
ho <caps> <caps> are doing
we went into <person> garage and found his <num> and brake fluid
one day i will teach someone to be patience to me and i will be happy to do that
his main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat
with a computer you can send a message from the computer to the persons cellular device
if this were done it would still lead to problems like kids reading the books at the library but never checking hem out
the <caps> said all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
there will not ever be a book that every human being agrees to be both appropriate and vivacious
and i hope you like what i wrote
the builders needed to converse the idea of a safe way in which dirigibles could dock there insuring that no one gets hurt
<caps> statement is as true as any statement could be
<person> team is so good this year because of <person> patience with his team and his understanding of his players talents
well it stops today i am writing today to stop the people who are ruining other peoples lives by getting rid of what other people like to do
he was worn out because the setting was so intense
over sixty thousands of dollars for the new frame work
this is so offensive
these obstacles were overlooked in the plans to create the empire state building
the expression on her face made me happy to know she was listening
people <month> think during the winter there is nothing to do
computers have helped us come along way since caveman times
all you do is go to <organization> and type in what you want to find
we drove over to <caps> house in my mighty mule of a truck
the reason for this is so she will have time to adjust
it gives them a bad name
sit on your back pond and go bird watching
so everyday i had to try to keep my mind on something besides the phone
he made me smile and feel like i could concore everything that came my way
maybe if my cousin would had been so patient she would have gotten the tickets
because that would mean the libraries would be gone
they will do anything to understand it
a public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers
for example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer <caps> parents would <caps> they would because your lack of communication with the family
the society in <caps> <num> proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways
the computer is good for doing homework you cant then always
another problem was winds
the time i needed patience

one by one <caps> took the orders
certain materials that are found in libraries are sometimes not age appropriate or even offensive to other people
we left my mom and headed to the first store
should be removed from a shelf due to content
when the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth
they steal the user away from the outside word
i took a deep breath and did what he asked
if you find a book offensive <caps> put <caps> back on the shelf and leave <caps> be
they could us that money and buy better books and at a lower price
well thats why i think computers benefit us
libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent
i think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness
however i think people used computers the most for communication
movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience
the determination pushes him to keep going further and further
by using the computer for more than one hour a day your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase
one time when another person i know was patient was when my stood in line for over an hour to get the tickets for the show were going to see
then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones

another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the empire state buildings mast was nature itself

patients is how long you can stay waiting for something or someone
i was patient went to the bathroom and to get a water
all loyalties aside in my honest opinion i believe censorship in the <caps> is a bad idea and will never work to solve actual problems with the world
that way they wont lose each other
of course <person> said <caps>
when we got home i just lade on the couch for a while
but i knew it was time to go and leave paradise

flat road is much easier to bike on then hills
as seen by this paragraph there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
sometimes they eat potato chips and cookies and have soda
the loving and respectful mood created by the author makes me think of my family
and those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you
this cost over <money> worth of modifications to be made to the framework
romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds
she said not to look in the mirror but i did and it was grass
the features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is
waking to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing by me was delightful and invigorating

but then i do see it the other way to
some people do not agree that computers are good
you also can see it from the way she acts
even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers
i ended up getting more nervous and began to stutter as we started to talk
i talked to my mom and she said
i love going though the books in the library you never know what to expect out a book
every day i wait for him in that same park
so everyone i strongly encourage you to reconsider what could happen without computers
so please help yourselves and the earth stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive
magazines inform us on what new and interesting
my second quote is my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family
we thanked the saleswoman as we opened our parasols for some shade
public views are starting to take over the world
the government should not get all the say in this series matter in hand

i set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted
you can talk to people from other places
sure some novels <month> expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it
laughing is a good way to relieve stress
if you taught i dropped it
computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world

so one thing that helps us is laughter
he was patiently waiting for <caps> to draw what she saw in her notebook
people that think those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
i believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people
i think that we should not even censor the content because i feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place
so this is why i think computers are a good thing
it is real relaxing to me
these features in setting are cruel
i think censorship is corrupting our society
<caps> in libraries should remain the same as it is now
this benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running
as a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read

the mood of this memoir is love and staying a family

it would make illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area
we all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like <organization>
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope
a second reason is the importance of friend ship

it was then that they told me we were going to the show
he felt like the world was against him
so please the local newspaper please try to make this believable
this explains that everyone near him was like family
i always bring my <caps> with me to keep me entertained
then we had to take the bus back to the train
there is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational
<caps> felt as if the world depended on <caps>
somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite
hope you enjoyed reading all about how they affect people
this can be a serious problem
when we got there it was pack full of people
that is why i think the setting affected the cyclist
this affected him a lot because the desert is very hot
people <month> think that this scene is to provocative and another person <month> look at that and say there is nothing wrong
i think patience comes into role in a lot of places
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
you must practice patience and give them respect

in that point of view you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves
he was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off
i heard a couple nights ago that <organization> had an earthquake
most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information
the shelves would be bare

my last reason why computers have a benefits in society is because computers help to make better technology
i interact a lot but the computer lets me talk to them when there not around

that is completely understandable
its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself

the setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure
it is also very happy
but a lot of people use computers almost everyday
he had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way
they find it affective and fast to use
laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation
i had to go to work with my dad
laughter laughter is the shortest distance between two people
in the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same

then we went to the park that was by our apartment
people have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world
and thats a time when i was patient
as my body grew older and my humor grew more funny i had made myself more dependent on my people pleasing personality
<caps> said so i can buy this cool new game
it is encounters with laughter like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation towards loosing weight and regaining confidence
high school and i was feeling pretty confident
how hand it would i had to hand writs all of my work and on the for information
a time when i was patience was on the car ride <location>
these are a few reasons i think computers put a positive effect on people
<organization> could help you out a lot
i think the mood in the memoir is love
we tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors
censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged immorality
the score was <date> to <num>
these children act in ways that reflect what they have seen
the author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength
our kids do not need to be learning about these sorts of things
they had to start over and that is what made him most grateful for his parents

if they are over age then thats total fine
i calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down

then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles
the high wind was a problem
the author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life
in seconds there will be thousands thousands of results
games are great to get your mind going
most <location> my extended family lives in <location>
i feel that there should not be censorship in libraries
so i had to be patient
the guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk
the idea of docking a one thousand feet long dirigible to a mast elevenhundred feet above the ground never seemed possible
we need and because of the realize ever a <organization> screen
i recently moved back from living with my grandparents in <location>
the main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world
so these are just some of the reasons i think computers could be bad
some people can and some people cant
when we got done loading everything into the car we headed home
your family is always their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day
it is basically any information in a click
people view offensive writing and actions differently from one another
i know the answer to that question
laughter is the best medicine many people say laughter is the best medicine
another big problem is education
maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed
i wish everyone would do the same
a kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing
this concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem
the lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two
it makes the reader feel admiration towards his parents and the author is trying to create a sense of appreciation and gratitude towards his parents
the builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
<caps> we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose
she finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home
not just the same thing everywhere i go
the world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things
i believe that all the books are meant to be in the library
in the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh
i have four friends that mean the world to me
i hope you are also patient with people
by this time momma got don with the stain i was fast a sleep on the couch
the rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey
so i was proud of how patient everyone was and i hope to do it again next time i go to <location> with my family
that is a time i was patience
i believe the quote stated above is quite true
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there
another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas
another reason is that it shows strength
if it got a hole in it then it would catch on fire
computers have a positive effect on people of all ages
we rent a large cabin that is right on the water side
dress up to educational
very many people are just too protective
i figure to take my friend <caps> to a concert shes been wanting to go too all year long
<person> smiled <caps> nodded to my relief
so we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe <caps> was time to go home
i realized that laugh could change everything
being my mother was watching the news i took him up on his offer
an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
a lot of teenagers have no patience
the structural problems this would have caused was the pressure on the buildings foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles
s i think we are not
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
a dirigible would only be held by one cable
if things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section
more than sixty thousand dollars was spent on restructuring the frame
computers are growing <location> keeping is on top
i remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now
people helpful is on the line with this computer thing
normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them
if i could i would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs
some content <month> not be suitable to younger kids
they are and cont find same thing to <caps> they for the <caps>
according to culture digest
after walking around a while this girl talked to me
there were many different moods throughout the passage
again i had to question myself i could be patient enough one by one people were getting in
another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him
reason three your health is at risk
then i hit a rock and did a front flip
the last reason was the law against airships
i had missed about an inning of the game already
<caps> proceeded to walk over to the group
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof
i <caps> been patient
the author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir
they can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive
the surgery took five hours
another reason was because of existing laws was airships flying too low over populated or urban areas
people enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to
the first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock
these obstacles included safety and availability
the computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of
she had to take a test but failed it
it can be useful to you when you have a report coming up
we think it might have broke
blimps would not be able to fly close enough without the wind pushing it
these i think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient
all those great times last <date> and all the ones to come
it could also help people find their <caps>
the number of computers sold has gone up <percent> since <date>
i have had good things happen to me
so you should really be consider judging the skills of the computer they really do help in life
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse
<person> says they are both right
<caps> i set up six bottles and was ready to shoot
flop i fell into the black chair and waited
i remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason
like the time where i met this guy named <person>
i believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that is also as enjoyable on it is
a final problem that the builders faced was a law that airships flying too low over urban areas
i really hope the people make the right choice
this problem is similar to others around the world
he read five books and only got a half <organization> a page <organization> notes for his assignment
a man by the name of <person> comes to my mind when asked about censorship in the media
my friend spent <num> hours on those websites
the theater was cozy and warm for being out in the cold for <num> hours <caps> felt good
another reason is using the empire state building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe
i jumped up and down
you have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it
<caps> i hope you read this with my regards
sometimes we would even laugh at each other during boring assemblies or at a ridiculous person attempting an act that everyone knows they cannot do
she will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
the time has come to decide
this website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on
these obstacles lead the designers to never effectively use the mooring mast like they had hoped to
you can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from
when i got there we pretty much just watched <location> in awkward silence
the material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read
his parents were loving and caring because they made their house into a home
thats when my <caps> had it
technology is wonderful <caps> explained to me
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm
around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us
so all you computer lovers get off and have some fun being outside with friends <person> your family
he also says these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
the bad effects are very serious and dangerous
a tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood
the answer should be simple
we let that thought pass and continued in our rout
<person> ends the article with a very inspirational quote
i study the glass jar of ketchup shes holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut
another obstacle they faced was safety
that is what the computer is for
like anyone i asked her what was wrong
in order to get a job using computers you need handeye coordination which computers teach us
this concerns some people
the <caps> were one of the worst teams in the <organization>
that is until i found <num> employees doing inventory
its not like the wind we had atat
does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because <person> will not read it
they should have a section for those certain kind of materials
in the story do not <caps> posted speed limit there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist
even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him outdated directions that almost <caps> him
this would cause the docking to be illegal
resulting in her calling me as soon as i sat down on my bed
says a local mother as she talks about a computer game
most of the kids are fit
offensive materials should not be removed from shelves
less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on <caps> or <organization>
the narrator called the factory
she needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her
in the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles
we as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions
and last but not least
i had to be patience many times
and last the <caps> service
they changed the way people think and how they look at the world
finally we took off from the tailgate
the final and greatest obstacle they faced to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself
another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt
so the effect of computers on people is <caps>
this law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city
nature itself also seems to <caps> a <caps> the winds above the building were very violent
in paragraph <num> line <num>
one time when i was doing my homework i started to be inpatient
i accepted and began
no man should ever make another persons decisions for them
<caps> doubted her luck
me as a child a <organization> is throwing me off of my homework
he is in a hot place similar to a desert
then finally i got impatience and bought him
it can be put on the computer or any type of device
it helps the cops catch the bad people
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
we only scored six points and ended up losing the game by a large margin
just like peoples personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities
while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building the workers faced many obstacles
she saw on the news that the were giving away tickets the morning of the concert
then again it <month> influence them in a fantastic way
this quote has a lot of meaning to a lot of of people
kids and parents should only be aloud <num> <caps> on the computer then go outside
we got are drinks and <caps> grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip
and thats how i can prove that laughter is an important part of any relationship
it shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore
he had stayed in the car <num> hour and he was starving
if you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such
all things in the world are not strictly black and white
those questions just might be flashing through your head right now
so i deleted the account
we only stopped three times that was not fun
you can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people
i think that i was pretty patient that day
that was really funny i replied
computers protects you and help you grow
they shows she loves her parents very much and always will
the height of the empire state building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on
the next town would have been in the <num> miles
it was the second <time> of our stay in <location> around <num> o clock
also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance
there is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country
but there was still stuff to do
they were actually happy that <organization> had <caps> patience and finally told them that we were friends
the reason for <caps> essay was to show why the process needs to be stop
i felt that all the people were warm and inviting
to me i would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons
i agree with those people
everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the <caps> has to follow
in conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen
it would defeat the entire purpose of <location> and its <organization>
the flower drivers to rebud
we waited on the bus for it to turn green
i always go on <organization> to talk to family living too far to visit
not everyone is offended by the same material
one example of an obstacle that the builders had to face was how to attach the mooring mast on top of the building
this say is said but its not followed
there was a ride called the freakout that we really wanted to go on
this means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there
if we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library
you can just <caps> chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes
censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept
i was only five at the time
a library is a place to go to learn about different things and should alway have information on different subjects and topics
when we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us
<caps> was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt
the censorship should be used only to help the kids
they can also play against people around the world
the mood created by the author is that <person> is grateful for what he has
people want to know whats going on in the world quick and easy
music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
it is true that many of these movies or the lyrics in the songs could strike someone as offensive
so people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer
i was very impatient because it was only <num> so i did my chores thinking time will fly by so i did my chores
we were going to <location> that <caps> when all of a sudden the <caps> sign came up on the <caps>
with emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world
every age would be bothered by this
i also learned to be patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerant
i tripped over my feet and fell
therefore history is taught in schools so that the bad events that occurred in history can be prevented
i laughed so hard i almost went the bathroom on myself
we told and him told him spending to much time on computers is bad for you
in this memoir the mood sounds like a happy one
they finally afforded to move into a threeroom apartment
maybe kids of all ages should have identification
the architects of the empire state building believed that dirigibles were able to dock on the building if there was a mooring mast
and every child was patient but <person>
censorship is somewhat the same way
computers can most certainly improve our society
the author of this memoir seems extremely happy and she thinks she found the definition of family
he was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and <caps>
they make it so family and friends do not come to see you
paragraph <num> says it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees celebrate their arrival to this country
they allow you to do homework that cant be done by hand
this was a major obstacle because the builders would have been violating a law
if there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent <caps> or read <caps>
they were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch
it was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often
only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water
reading this made me feel very thankful
pulling into <person> drive way i shut off the truck and stuffing the keys into my left front pocket i walked into <person> house
<caps> is a novel that displays what life was truly like in one of <location> most racially barbaric times
my mom is one of the most patient people l know
the computer has things for every person in the world
the next <num> days my mom and dad was talking about going to the movies and out to dinner
friendship is like that
these are the moods the author created in this memoir
it is important to have patients because in life its not always fair and you have to wait your turn
we found a nice spot at the other side of the lake
the mood is <caps> in many ways
he had just the most straight angry look on this face
censorship can be a very good thing
<caps> the line was so long and
but nothing that i found offensive personally
as i got older it was still the same
because there was no buildings for miles be broke the ride into short distances
