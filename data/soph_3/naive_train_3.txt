you can almost feel how grateful he is for is happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the writing
at first the cyclist feels fine he gets a little bit discouraged but basically hes fine
dear local newspaper i have been asked to write a letter stating opinion on the effects computers have on people
movies over attract both parents and teenagers alike the music entices the teenagers and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children
they can teach a whole new language or help you understand the science lesson better
in these instances these violent stories are important for our youth to see and i think that they should not be censored in the library
they provide the public in another way to find a new or another job
hearing the waves  laughing ocean waters and feeling it cool as the is just heaven
to this very day people have become very addicted to computers
travelling has great educative value
therefore my opinion is that is be one of the greatest inventions
you can research faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe
i feel the same way because my parent brought me here for a better life
they are because they get start a new life over
more and more people are using computers daily basis but i do not agree that this is benefiting our society
i can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night
biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike and not in a car
i am lucky to have mr david as my next door neighbor
does that seem right to you
they will majority impact your future and impact all people in a bad way
if i am late to come home it waits for me on the roadside
like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil or something
and i know that know one whats that to happen
they never understood what they wrote they put it in full sentences
this evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried
when she sees the plant labeled jasmine she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair
i found that quite ridiculous when i heard about it
so reader these are some reasons why people should easily computers
i know that out of people love to travel but you need plane tickets
if you live in a big city you have bigger better libraries
if a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it then take it up with the teacher
if the setting had been in a more urbanized area the cyclist could have gotten help from other people which would have made his ordeal very easy
first kids should not be watching rated movies or even if it has vulgar content sexual content violence and etc
this is my people should stop being lazy and have some fresh air
finally i have explained to you why having a computer is a good thing
lastly computers provide games for your personal entertainment which helps kill boredom
we can learn something from any thing we read
and when she begins thriving and feels like herself again then shell be ready to take the driving test and pass
i say this because when you have an addiction to anything it is hard to stop
 i want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem
another reason computers effect the lives and people the dangerous chat rooms
it is at this point that he uses the word crippling because he is just about exhausted and cant go any further
the library should listen to its customers that visit the library often
that book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read
the people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen too
the material could have or show some much needed information
is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent
but most computer users us the computer as a tool to learn and get work done
computers also help with instructions on how to make things
most jobs need the internet to work like architects need the computer to design buildings and houses
dear  i believe that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives
the cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man
all these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people
this gave him a better life
whether some people find certain material offensive or not there are other ways to get that material so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries
so have a bad on people
so i ask you to consider the benefits of computers but also look for the negative effects
using computers is something i know millions of people use everyday and would think would be difficult to live without
and many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about there religion race or anything that involves to there personal life
another reason kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades
authors publishers editors and directors all have a right to express their opinions in their work
yeah i said it free
all in all i think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves
this quote explains what the plant meant to her
the author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life
during the story the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test
setting depends on how you can go or move
for example  want to go ride bikes
it is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well
you could invite friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to met
parents should want to keep kids far away form certain things that appear offense
so in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation
i have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects
thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere
he got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water
and i say that to an extent
he describes how all immigrants left their country just to give their children better lives
in my opinion there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature
i believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society
some people treat the donkey very badly but it takes them
these books that we leave behind influence the future of our society
addiction to computers is also a very negative impact
i paid nineteen dollars for it
gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger
others might not think anything of the item and move along
someone might have wanted to get that book
you can talk to people from far away by using chat or the webcam
that someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout
after months the fit and healthy became obese
he also cares that his parents do so much for other people
talk to friends
with any of these materials it should all be available to you in a library
more kids would be educated so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff
they could include multiple things that could scar a kid for life
censorship just be a big word to most people but it carries a big problem
no one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas
the store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book
studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours
there are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things
did you know that people use their computers extremely often
computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it
he felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke
they over powered both of them and tied them to cots
people you actually really need talk to such as friends teachers or even people you never talk to in school
i believe that certain materials such as books music movies magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf
censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today
just the other year the librarian whom i stay in constant contact with asked me if she should take the book off the shelf
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen
this way you can make arrangements
milk is used for making tea and coffee
it has flower plants and fruit trees
suddenly i heard a loud noise
there was nowhere for him to find water for miles
then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him
but i hope to find some good home again
an effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the ridiculously large snake he had seen
people sit on there butt all day
you can make a brochure of sales and expenses all with an easy stroke on the mouse
level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit the setting affects the cyclist in many ways
did you know that libraries contain books movies music magazines etc
my most favorite flower is rose flower and orchids
with this attitude toward outdoor activities i am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends
dear local news paper i agree that technology has a positive effect on people
first of all computers are a big source of knowledge
the cyclist found a deserted building he lost more and more hope
dear local newspaper i strongly think we should have no more computers rather then looking on the computer
there are more bad things in them then in books or music
you can also gain the ability to learn
they tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever
mechanics use the computer to create blueprints officers use a computer to keep track of all the license plates
from my own experience controversy is the reason that books are stricken from libraries
so are businessman benefited by him
he says he is grateful for the spirit an generosity given to him by his parents at a young age
movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship
i strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society
finally there is no water around
everyone has their own views which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material be to them
are assistants porters ticket checkers and signalmen to help him
been for computers and 
he thought how to get rid of these sufferings

thing thing another and of a madden or hours have already passed by
protecting your children from things that offend you stop them from growing up badly
recently on the news i saw a segment of how at they are using robots to make surgery more efficient
this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep eat computer
it also turns the man into a beast
or at least try to do the same
lastly the computer strengthens hand eye coordination
i remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books
consequently kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on
lastly due to the rising demand of computers companies typically rely on computers for jobs
i found it very interesting and educational
we i have came up with what i think about it
you searched everywhere by everything that the book would possibly be listed under
no one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another
if we censor the material in a library it is denying the public of the real world
do i think offensive reading materials should be taken off the shelves in libraries
the setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike
and that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of 
the music is not all that bad its just that the kids can take these off the shelves and take it home and listen to it
our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved
if people took the books and other things like that off the shelves there would be hardly anything to read
the computers are ruining family connections
with a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips
and you can pay your bills on the computer
so the lion is called the kind of the forest
most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it
where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself
including the importance of one
the city owns them
they allow you to talk to people that you and feel that they are there with you
if we start censoring books writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts
this is why i think that computers are very great and useful
if think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it
in the states’ pavilions the industrialists and businessmen were busy finalizing business deals
you can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type
the mood changed throughout the memoir
personal and meaningful conversations sometimes be
i have never had the interest of hearing it again as i felt that the story is not politically correct
there was no place to stop for water and if there was the water was bad and warm

in spring they will return to start over raise goslings rebuild their home start over from last spring
well with the computer and internet access you can easily contact them through great social networks such as 
computer junkies what are they
i have dealt with situations like before everyone has
for example me and my family went on vacation to  and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home
in conclusion working hard and give up its a part of our life and its up to our selves to overcome failing
the books music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals
as she told her mom she felt the pain again but her mother made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant
moving you fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise
because it quit its amazing and its a large area
mr kailash is a popular person
this also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again
this is what we are putting into our movies and books and magazines and putting into the children of heads
but others are like why not they are going to know about it in and when they are married also
even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place
you can talk to each other

censorship happens everywhere you are
you can learn about many different cultures
i say we just let it be and let people be happy
most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out
 instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat
he ran out quickly
students around the world for example need to research information for a topic in class
but if it offended someone should he be allowed to remove it
this makes life a lot simpler
your family is much more important than a silly computer game
i spend two hours daily in my garden
you know as well as anyone most video games are not good for you
this affected his body by making him tired and his mind because he started doubting himself
a person has their own rights to choose what they want to read watch or listen to
secondly computers are another way to go to collage
i believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need
par 
for example you can research almost anything
i should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to
if you take a break go on you relax simple games put out a variety of websites
another reason why my censorship in libraries is because it would give my library more variety
first of these is the blazing heat
people can believe what they want but the issue will be hard to conclude
the answer to solving this problem to me is black and white children should just not pick up those types of materials end of case
the mood created by the author is happiness and gratefulness
do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around
next is that you could be outside enjoying nature
you see much of our population spends at least hours a ween on the computer
for them to see or hear
the cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride
the author was grateful to his parents

bad people are afraid of him
with what i believed was my last burst of energy i maneuvered down the hill 
this gave me a sense of how in times of struggle people will come together and help each other push through
business men are not the only ones doing that though
they try to do the same things as what there favorite artist or actor does
they show a persons opinion on something
on average out of suffer from stress
people should have the choice to read or watch whatever they want to
some company joined to make one together
therefore those parents brought the books to the attention of the school board who quickly removed the books from its library shelves
so i want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions
he was so proud to have parents who cared so much and had such selflessness
well that is not all true
worst of all we will lose all expectation and respect for mother nature
computers allow new means of communication
still you can use the computer to look up cheats on video games
computers are making our lives easier day by day and who knows what they will be able to do in the future
whether you are doing work or things for pleasure
this concerns some people
in the memoir the author created a mood
second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about
plus the person who wrote or made the object would be shot down  of sadness or rejection
you never get up unless you absolutely need to
all his fruits are very fresh and juicy
you can just use and you type your essay
they can also help us keep in touch with our loved ones
for older kids there are many games that can play
college students teachers and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books movies music and magazines
also you can back hotels and look at live pictures with more than just 
the next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself
by staying active and being outdoors with your friends could save you from these dangers
the intense heat rough terrain the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task
i found this compromise to be very fair
i you will come through to yourself and agree
if you have ever been to a movie theater you know they have certain ratings
we saw that a man was getting drowned in the lake
now if you organize your thoughts on the computer and are able to look through them again at why a huge alleviated
this applies to the maturity of the reader as well
it would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination
do i agree
humanity relies way to much on the computer
example is if you forgot to write down your homework in your agenda or something then you can go on the school website and see what your homework is
in example use for projects
i am against censorship
i think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way
there was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere
the computer is one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events
should that be the new normal
like books music movies and magazines should be censored too
this not the way to be treating a device
i often find books movies or magazines offending another race
who knows what computers will be like years from now
there are also many news stories that many people consider offensive
they could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence
next time he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions
while working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer
to begin the internet provided with most home desktop computers can teach us a lot about the world around us
i think everyone should have at least one or two computers in their house they were invented for a reason
it all depends on the person
the effects of what come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read
the short story winter hibiscus end the way it does because the narrator realizes that with simply comes a new chance or opportunity to start over a rebirth
people actually need the computer for their the new technology that is coming out is letting people interact with people across the world
maybe its politics it could be a sports team
it changed from flat road to short rolling roads
the computer is necessary for our society today
there are books and magazines you can read at anytime you want
though troubling he still had the confidence that he could continue
others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read
if the cyclist does not see any buildings he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it
these are key factors that show us that you can have fun on computers and still have time for family and friends
also it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation
you thought he was years old but he was not
after she met the flower she thought of her old country her homeland she missed it
many books are banned that address great problems of society
also the cyclist was biking in the heat
the cyclist was in a bad situation
if everything is removed because of an opinion the world of the arts will be no more
on that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting
think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer
many people think one way about something while other people think of it completely different

you never know
you know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer
i was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day
it is the first thing that we look for every morning
another time that i would say to use your computer is when doing some work projects or homework
my first reason why i think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community
you can even go to school online but as i was saying you can learn about anything
it could be interesting to someone else but not you
is just of several quotes from a book that i am reading that some people could take offense to
in conclusion we should limit our computer time to do other tasks be active and spend time with friends and family
so what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed
he also explained how his parents built the home on their own that he got to grow up in
the internet makes everything we do on the computer possible
i want to see that word and feel its full effect
lastly you can just plain talk
the terrain was tough just like the authors terrain
these machines get our messages and vices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds
first we see this comforting mood being established through the setting
the uses computers to save lives
the authors of the books or items did not
i also thank that it is a good thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life
everyone is different
people spend way to much time on computers
saying that the material is unsuitable for a younger age group is correct but at that age the children should be with adult when checking out books anyway
this depression needs to stop
the things that harm people are in there to show people in the younger generations how life was lived in the older days as in the slaves
we have to step up as the life goes
many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better
it reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role
if another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same
on top of that you remember you were supposed to meet your sister today who you seen for years but you cant
in the cyclists opinion things began pretty well
in this memoir is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to to give him a better life
and with that i conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people
these computers provide access to games helpful in training
i think that books music movies magazines and etc
all your doing is staring at a screen
also it teaches us to process what is around you and decide in a decision
computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day
not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not
furthermore enjoying nature is a must in our world full of immense landscapes wide waters dense forests and lush valleys
you can write a visual letter to one of your friends
books are very valuable to most people in the united states
authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored
the movement swelled and the people soon developed a national pride and goal
an ideal student should help the parents in household matters he should go to bed at a fixed time
if somebody wants to read about a specific topic then they have the right to
when you are using technology usually it is work related
he also had pretty much ran out of water
things do need a little censorship
the author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home
if you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to google and type it in
you can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores cool is that
secondly the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social
rose hibiscus lily orchids sunflower dahlia etc
i have to say that i agree with them
i mean how could anyone live without family friends the beauty of nature and your own health
it is saying that when everything else starts coming to life she will also accomplish something
children now look up to these song writers and want to become them
thank you for your time and i hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter
computers are real useful
i do not think so
because shes learning more about it  will be ready for the test next spring
and if all the books are taken off the shelves then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well
this all stays next all on the computer
some people do not have the money to buy books or internet so these people rely on public libraries
one day he says to me because of i want to work with computers
he was becoming tired and thirsty
that is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids
in the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his child hood home
the mood created by the author is outstanding
that also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful
i think this mood is happiness
according to  economic  every hour you spend on the computer you raise your electricity bill by 
the says how glade he is that his parents help him out a lot
but once she gets home and tells her mother she failed her driving test she seems to feel better
there is a lot to be learned from only a few words
when people think about computers the first thing they think of is games
people in the community have rights to read hear or watch witch ever type of material they like
she took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time
i know your thinking that computers could be used for education but humans prefer fun over anything else and i hoped this helped you realized that
if everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves we would have nothing left
its anonymous and can be detrimental to the lives of others
the right to read certain books should not be left to a conservative few because everyone has their own opinion about everything
sometimes it be better to go outside and play but computers do help you learn and communicate with others which are just as important
he is very cooperative by nature
its just a way of life
this feeling of gratefulness contributes to the warm happy feel of the piece
computers can also keep you in from outside to get fresh air and sunlight
artists authors and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice it is their freedom of speech
so teenagers think  if they can do it so can i
there are tons of books in the library that people find offensive to young readers today
these are about computer how people spend time on them
he loves his parents what they did for him
i just made more friends when i moved
some people that go online to research stuff are probable being lied to maybe someones just messing with them
i think the authors mood is honored proud loving and appreciated
i believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder
you can  you can go on chat rooms
he told me to look to my left
does it just end here and now
so have i my dislikes are many
she even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends
also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town
lastly you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people
the mood of this story is happy
in  everyone wants censorship
this is bad for your eye sight
if i was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me
by her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change
health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst
the mood created by the author is a happy mood
we should conserve them
they will be curious
a library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment and those very offensive books do not teach learning or are entertaining
people have a right to read what they choose to read
loving place that holds so many memories
books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately
her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her drivers test again in the spring
planes will fly near me and i can wave hands to pilot
they know better than to start fights or cuss in school
dear newspaper i think computers are great
so computers lets us do anything and everything
so i think some magazines should be removed off the shelves
this also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test
if another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf
do something else than be on 
i think that no books should be taken away
the arabian desert and the libyan desert are famous deserts of the world
to the main character friendships and home is very important to him
libraries can not take the books away all together from readers who enjoy these kinds of books
in conclusion i think everyone that likes to look up places play games and chat should have a computer
not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing
i believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive
someday when i have kids i will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material
like the title states the setting of this story was a rough road ahead
i believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people
people use censorship as a way to make themselves feel like their a good parent or that the world owes them something
there are several features that causes the author to dehydrate
you tell me
teachers are telling us this while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be
computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know
computers cause you to turn away from them
some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie
the fashion of the and is just a project i did last month
i mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there but then what would be the fun of that
her friends and family refugees came to her house all the time
i have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list

this nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to
finally computers is kind of like one 
and put garlands of

you can look  browse at things available in a store
it is because they can give there child a better life
my garden is very dear to me
imagine yourself a white year old boy growing up in an all white town
reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening
this is a amazing thing to be able to do
also you can look up information on any place or any project and it will help you
you can chat with people typing
i know their are people that will agree or disagree but what i think they should do is leave them
these four boys who are all around eleven years old use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life
everyone in society is still going to act this way whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not
she will feel ready to take her test again when they came back
how could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation
because he is in the desert on a long bike ride he is dehydrated
online and keep in touch with family and friends
the mood i think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness
in the very last sentence it is noticeable
some spend years trying to perfect their masterpieces
the cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal
even though some people disagree computers are the base of technology safe and full of knowledge i do
people think that magazines are very important to the society
people just have to learn how to not use foul language when not needed
this i think can help with the problem
heavy metal music you cannot understand it but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we living
most do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active
most people will turn to one of the most commonly used piece of technology in the  the computer
the library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well
teachers are known to be the second parents
he thinks that some miracle will happen and he will become rich and prosperous

if a student has a question about an assignment he or she can ask a friend or the teacher
the cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did

this bait store gave him water and a good map
they even have maps and you can print out directions
we should all join hands to build a greener and healthier environment
you have to be careful where you go when using the internet
dear  since electricity was invented technology has developed at a rapid rate
people who support computer usage might say
the second reason i think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music
as for music and movies i think we have let ourselves go a little too far
the internet is a great way to have a highway of information at the touch of a button
if i were an expert i would have nothing to worry about concerning computers
many agree computers disadvantage many people in their own way
he is polite and courteous
in conclusion the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be
also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke
dehydration also can be fatal

even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie

then last he is near no towns so he cant get anymore water so the setting does effect the cyclist
i do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
since the time children are in grade school they learn typing on a keyboard
thirdly they can learn about distant places
my last argument for this is a heads up for the parents
from around the well and computers open up new information to anyone
should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive
if the library took that movie off of the shelves they would lose business due to one person
if we let everybody take books off the shelves then there will be none left
i think that libraries should not remove material such as book music movies magazines
it just put your mind at ease
the mood created by the author was a very unique one
should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment
this shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless
the idea of taking a book off the shelf is a bad because people want to read books like that
we still got to talk and have a nice conversation
many people also use the internet for communication purposes
what do i think about library censorship
also the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard which drains him or her of even more energy
people can use a webcam aim or email to communicate with other people
sundays generally have a fixed routine for the tv programs
people not want there kids to look at certain things but they need to keep them were there kids cant find them
the most important is the computer
this is something we hear everyday
the final key had to travel and the road conditions
my second reason states that there is some history on many different websites
also using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers
the computer can also have an affect on family members and the time spent with them
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
i would read all of them this year
if you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise

peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless
anybody ever think of that
books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got
we even use computers in libraries why the library
water is very necessary for us
is this helping us
we as the people must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs along with movies and other media
the test that she failed tested her memory of her home
who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think
from the creations of rockets engines and planes computers have never let us down
so you would have to ask for the movie or and someone will go get it from the back for you due to explicit content or explicit lyrics
now would you want that
teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story
that is all i have to say
they have to join the other queue and are again at the fag end
if the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution
no one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries
she thought that maybe i would think what i see on is not a bad thing 
love is shown a lot through family in this memoir
its opens up to be beautiful again
when he finds no one to help  nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated
interacting with friends and family is important for everyone
they teach people about history and faraway places
in addition some books in the library are used for informational text
do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves
alone with this the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
everyone has there own way of writing and there own imagination
getting that hibiscus reminded her of her homeland and it gave her memories of then

the setting affected the cyclist greatly
people can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it

that is just apart of humans having their own opinions
everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them
a god fearing person will never become sinful or violent
this was in response to the first town he came across
the censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next
 instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat
the mood show that the author had a great childhood and loved his neighborhood very much
this would not be fair to the people who wrote the books and to those who like them
also with a computer you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal
you ever want to communicate with your friends all day long without wasting minutes
kids do not need to be learning these things at such a young age
dear local newspaper  are computers really as great as they seem
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
have we made the world a better place by attempting to hide a part of history
that situation could go both ways though
you can not removed that
that can disappear in a instant
i say this because in every situation either one side benefits both sides benefit or neither side benefits
every day we see how they struggle to keep us happy
she turned it in and the teacher gave it back the following day
we all know that computers can be a good and bad thing
her computer would have to have and 
as a nation we can lower the statistic above and create a better environment altogether
how they go about getting that message across is their own business and they have all to do so in anyway they wish
they do not have it
now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to
these books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes
discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day
new read on for reason
the same should go for a library
for you it might seem the greatest movie ever or the most terrible movie in the universe
i understand a lot of things in this world is about money and people make money by selling things to others
i do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing
computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology
so keeping them in shelves could help our future
hobbles thirst and fear were all behind me
this is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers
it should be up to the parent to decide which books there child should read which magazines they should buy and which television programs they should watch
most media and books have things uncensored for many different reasons and i think its going good
shockingly the book interested them
they help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers
the conclusion for the story is a nice ending
these are all great ways of using the computer
if the government enforces the censorship law people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject
recently the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention
they seemed to be quite indifferent to me
lastly computers are useful and should be useful more
they promise you and make you believe to get you ideal things for your money
the feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one the conditions of the road were awful
meeting people from various professions is my another hobby
while one reader love the story and wear out the pages another get halfway through and never finish it
the kid be underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate
this is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist
so i had planned in detail how i would revise both subjects that day
no one stops and thinks about someone else or their family
in my opinion computers are a thing for our everyday lives
also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment
computers are extremely distracting
for example he says how his parents cooked and after that and for which i am eternally grateful
also your bills will get higher
not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people find funny other people get offended by

in the essay do not exceed speed limit the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways
but i still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while
libraries contain many different selections of books music and magazines
through reading the book   by  i have observed that parents need to have some involvement in their children are reading listening to and watching
most people east sleep and drink computer
they just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie
had a warm and loving childhood which he depicts greatly in his memoir
this can prevent many problems
phones are just a tiny version of a computer
we can meet new people on the internet
computers make people happy and that makes for a better society because it is happier
which is a saying i have heard many of times
dear local newspaper in my opinion i support the advances in technology
for instance when arriving at the first town the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence
also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home
we can also get it from activities
the variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation
if i were the author i would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive
the narration of rough road ahead a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story
no one knows
but even besides having bad people online computers can with your privacy
they also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong
in the story it says the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
but why read a book
firstly they would check out sites to go to in 
should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive
adults need them for their jobs like sending emails or typing a proposal
dear  have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer
this memoir really sets of mood of love and comfort
i believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive but it is all fact
mr peter is very fussy about his food

one of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in
second the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of to handle
there you go there are endless possibilities with computers
many children can go an entire day without sitting down  talking to their parents
now make it
how about old friends that moved away
it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for

what do you see

i go to sleep at ten o’clock
he became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse

the author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons
as for music it can go both ways
but now my parents have to consult me to leave the computer multiple times
once i witnessed such a fight from close quarters
every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects
i love the libraries nothing will ever stop me from going
without them society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today
are growing fast they are meant in be active and playful and without any active sport like dancing nor basketball they are going to grow big
i promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view
also if you just want time to go by you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with other and playing games
also what a lot of people like about computers is the games
you enjoy a certain genre or topic that someone else find offensive
there were bumps along his ride and the sun beating down his thirst he became less courageous and less optimistic
this research can be used to write essays in school
how much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer
there are also many books on the  some people find that offensive or not want their kids reading about that but that is history
out the memoir you really start to see the authors opinion of the definition of home and family
being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful
those are the moods that i think the author created during the memoir
because or she does not agree with the views expressed
the snow melting would be the pain going away
the a lot of his in the story

this quote clearly represents a loving mood throughout the memoir because like the first quote it represents friendship and family
the feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water
not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed
not spending much time can have a big effect on mother nature
 reason why i think that people are not spending too much time on computers is because can help you in many things that you need help on
most of the topics of books music movies or magazines are helpful
well if you are than you need to listen to this upcoming message
its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences
like i said in the beginning computers are part of our everyday life and its not a bad thing they can be very helpful
the author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood they still treat each other as if they were
some of our family or friends live in far away places so we use the computer to talk
the affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office
i do not believe that is very offensive at all
people like them
now we get to magazines
if someone where to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable
a whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life his parents rarely did things for their own benefit
if you are sending someone a list a recipe for example
dear newspaper editor i have recently heard that some people think that computers have a negative effect on people
i will say though if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want
maybe she wants to see what lays ahead

when you are on the computer the internet allows you to search anything and everything
i know so many people who use computers instead of doing homework and getting fresh air
truly this is a good thing to let people use
there was a great rush outside the railway station
this also shows that the library or so far as the country is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed
email and have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills
this thought process is immoral
she was neat and clean that she got promoted
to the grandmother is offensive
my daddy presented it to me on my eight birthdays it helps me cover distances in a short time
through most the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way
in my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities
cyclist are used to riding on smooth paved roads
if you have a test or quiz in  you can go on your computer and print out practice sheets
parenthesis are used five times in this writing as well as five words with dashes
such as music there are all kinds of music out there
computers are a magnificent part society
you can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple days before
people have the right to things that they enjoy
some things that we read see and hear are just going to be offensive and we cant control everything that offends us
after the train ride we sat in a restaurant and had our lunch
censorship what does that mean to you
the computer is beneficial and has a positive affect on society
but if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem
both of those books are by the author 
libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments or about animals or anything else
this kind of stuff gets our attention and makes us interested
your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved
my favorite would have to be the computer programs
while reading a book a viewer skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them
it is much easier looking it up on the computer
as i mentioned people who use computers too much are getting less exercise
it is just a matter of life
my bicycle has a carrier too
the content in libraries offensive or not should not be removed
there are many games and other types of games out on the internet
rather a old movie or a new release
if you use the computer for educational purposes like games you could really learn a lot
i believe the author set a very personal mood in this story
my disagreement to the situation is that the its a library and libraries have different types of books
i think that if certain materials are offensive that they should be taken off the shelf depending on how they are offensive
another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water
also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance
but that just the basics
there are running program held at our local beach  where you can exercise or even run a small competition
this quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty it can do what it takes to survive
sometimes your letter is even lost and these is no way of finding out
while they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life
my third reason is that it helps send things all over the world
by everything i have said the mood throughout the memoir was happy kind caring and many moods similar to those
today you can try to create a law or bill that make it through the government now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material
they still have good information that someone other than you want to know
well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology
no form of life exists on it due to unfavorable conditions
students who are young usually get to learn to type
some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age
he got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead
for example the hibiscus represents
plus i know a lot people who feel the same way
some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings while others over the same topic believe the complete opposite
its up too the parents to assist their 
computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge
if parents started watching what their kids do then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be
some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time in their computers and less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
which side would you choose
so as you can see computers have many wonderful effects on people
that even though you left your family friends jobs everything is okay because you are with each other

for example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained
it is as simple as that
the ideas of resilience when faced with challenge  and the determination to adapt and succeed
i say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off
i have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict
it is just life
with a computer it is much easier at your job or at school
so do computers really benefit to our society
this will be good for every race too
i believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books
books music and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them
for school events sport schedules and keeping in touch with far away family and friends
maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence drug and alcohol use
so keep reading and think what you hear that could or has happened to you
my brother learned swearing from the new  advanced game of 
people are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the 
every person in the world is different but we have one thing in common
this is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it
when it comes to censorship in libraries i feel that all the books should be left on the selves
so when i read about people wasting time on the computer all day i myself was very upset
we should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way
shows his love by telling his parents
learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child
rappers most of the time rap about female killing people  and etc
hibiscus is everything far her
this saves the lives of many people
where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect
they are warping the minds of people all over and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be
disrespectful acts cussing and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment
schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on find information and do homework on too
the setting relates to the person and plays a role which the cyclist can observe
for example what if you were into rap or the hip hop culture and someone finds that offensive
it is very beautify place and i am very like to spend the evening in the home garden
but as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland
also computers now have videos all over on how to do things like how to and other useful information
the dry bland and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey
they can find passwords to accounts
libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers for their library are students
clearly without computers life as we know it would be way different
on his search my younger brother had found himself a sports illustrated magazine
i hope you think about this
overall the main mood of this memoir is gratitude
i have people who stay up for our their paper
so next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends family and your health is more important
that is why some material should not be taken away
even at times the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming
also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in 
music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things
even though they are found offensive to someone someone else could use that material for a paper or project
at the end you know we all need to type our essays lesson and more
censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience
lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society
what a waist money
i know i use the web to with almost every project i have
but here comes the computer to the rescue
his parents thought that if they get through the bad time they will enjoy the good times to come and for that he always thanked them
in conclusion the author in the memoir had created a mellow feeling throughout the whole memoir
the internet never closes it is open 
now in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results
when it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back
movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch
not only do the alternatives that i stated before keep people safe they also practice a healthier way of living
so he can have a better life
every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person
it prepares a man for the day’s work
so that proves computer is a great machine
that is the question
even as it is now parents try to hid such things from their children
some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road
even though you are talking to them you are not learning any new social skills
a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers
the climate in this story was very hot and dry and the terrain was full of hills so altogether that would make one bad bike ride
the narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly
the most challenged book in school libraries is 
the cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump
first of all computers give you information on things that you cannot find in books
no they not use computers more
some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise or even spending time with family
the author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown
i think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries
i think computers have a positive effect on people because today you can do almost anything
people should be aware of some of the content in books
children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television
if she believed they were offensive then she could remove the books without any questions being asked
when it comes to things like this there is a huge range of topics
i believe that is only helping the world on a day today basis
not to mention computers cost way too much money
he could have gotten more reliable advice or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart
the author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love
when the government is making decisions that effect us that personally do we still truly have freedom
hacking was become a world wide sport
everyone uses them or has used them before
i do think that some materials should be banned from people under age some from kids and some from everyone
with no computers how would you download music to an 
society is losing its communication skills
booksmusicmovies or magazines wont be pulled because of emotions
someone else might want to read it
they should be able to read anything they want
also they have many medical problems
the features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of rough road ahead do not exceed posted speeding limit
children can also read or listen about gun violence
some of you think a computer can increase social skills and you are dead wrong
they know some citizens are against that content
the second reason why i think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
all they care about is their own family
that tried to put a stop to it but the plan never worked
computers are like chocolate
libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials
their loads from place to place
in this article i am going to talk about the way libraries sensor their books
it provides useful information to everyone
for instance computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them
the cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature
the weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw
the kinds of music people listen to
i mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area
also some of the music that is on shelf should be remove from all store
is not offensive the whole way through
games teach us the way to face failure which we come across atadversary corner
dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water
but computers can teach you so much more than just different countries
he has failed in the eight class three times
i can back that up as well
computers are like keys they open doors to new places and ideas
i would like to state on my behalf that i do not agree that computers are good for society
illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse
so he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside
censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to
so reader these are some ways why people should enjoy computers
young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful
i think this because when was talking throughout the story talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are
as more  more people log on to technology they seem to come out with new things for computers
you can learn about any subject on a computer at anytime
first it is in the summer so it is very hot
this is why movies books magazines or even music should not be removed from shelves
the desert that he was in
the author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself
if these offensive things were not aloud to be showed i personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents
for example the sun was beginning to heat down pg 
that sums it up on
the kids are to blame to
some say your not exercising or nothing so you get too fat or too skinny and your not healthy at all
there is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive so why take them down
people should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer
all things with her become better
but for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other 
he is cultured and polite
they are here for a reason
when riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst
it also gets harder as you go getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on
the last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with
for example or use technology to type in peoples orders and amount they pay
the setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp
only people would think its fun to home and go on the computer for no reason
they be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that
in stories author lend them many different ways with many different effects
that is the mood in the home blueprints of our lives
libraries have always had interesting materials such as books music movies and magazines and there always will be
so then you spend nights in bed tossing and turning
the rain is useful for crops and trees
everyone has a different look on it
since i play basketball volleyball and softball hand eye coordination is extremely important
there were many people that were like family to him
taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative inventive and inspired world
not just for games
they could publish bad things go on ridiculous websites and watch horrible things
computers allow people to play a wide variety of games
she has a small workshop where these dolls are made
taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them but this will decline the library usage and people will slowly stop reading
second it helps us connect with and meet new friends
all of these make the cyclist start to give up hope
why not go out side and throw a ball to one another
dear local newspaper i see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society i on the other hand strongly disagree with them
the use social networks allows kids to put all their information there for anyone to see
is time running out for your project to be do
those are all the reasons why i think computers are a good use
this is also good for jobs
eighty seven percent the internet
half an hour
i believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up
they are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself
but not cool enough to not go outside and have free natural fun
i believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials
can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers
many people go to libraries such as children parents and grandparents
it would have been burning hot
some street hawkers are not clean
he returns home very tired
life without books
i just think the memoir sets a happy mood
he should take care of his health
the books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well
i feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not
“simple life” saysthe prophet mohammed “set my heart on high thoughts”
another reason that i would be all for computers is being able to learn things
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
first of all i know many people think that others wasted their time on computers
how do we know what offends people i mean everyone is different everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs
the postal department should try to improve his lot
he makes his lessons interesting
without the computer everything would become so time consuming that no one would want to get the work done
nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have
i always thought how the human body works is incredible
this is why censorship would not work in our libraries
this online behavior must stop people are getting addicted and gaining wait from the lock of physical activity
the setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist
books music movies and magazines are all a form of expression
and most of all the place he had called home not the space but everything and everyone him
dear readers of the  you imagine life without your computer
for example what if your friend and did not
our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a little higher
faithhealing cured many patients miraculously
first of all different people consider the same content differently and the titles being removed not be judged fairly
books should not be censored
parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are  they should just take the computer away
i would say all the moods in this memoir is loving caring friendship and equality
this happens a lot to average people
one of the boys calls out hey look at his and the rest of his family rushes to his side
the scenery was breathtakingly beautiful
there are so many varieties to choose from
computers take away too much to be spending so much time on
more and more people use computer but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
i go on the computer to to my friends and check email and stuff and then i go outside to play
that is how the cyclist is affected by his setting and despair is turned to hope
in fact i teach myself at home
music is a major part of each one of our lives and without it the world would be a much different place
one person love a book and another person hate it
then just get a door that says and older and put cameras up
most news is about things that are bad rarely any good news comes around
adding rough pavement rusty water pumps and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well
dear  you believe people spend way to much that on computers
her mother replies with a you what
especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them
computers are wonderful
the author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it
so i believe that we can call find a healthy balance computer use
social networking sites like or allow with all your friends and other online games help you met new people that could be hundreds of miles away from you
i believe that this is one main reasons of obesity
but its a great way to stay in touch with people
dear local newspaper you like a place where you can control what you and where you go
i believe with computers having a strong a positive affect on people
each person has their own type of information and genres that they like
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways
so i think their benefits our society
i loved each moment of it
you can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line
it shows the theme of the story really
when i go to a library i find some stuff that is offensive to me
the more kids read about this the more they think violence is okay
his spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water
he discovered how to send radio signal by using invisible electric waves
that is one thing i do not like about computers
at one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done
dear  a recent survey said that out of doctors think the advances we have made with technology and computers is helping us rather than hurting us
they do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online
i love my brother
but some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children
everybody should have their right to what ever it is that they read or like to watch
if you can ban my words then i can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future
people have friends and it is only human to want to keep in close contact with them
she had her opinion and i also had mine
if you take out things like that in the books they read then how will they learn
dear local newspaper i have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society
a lot of people have classes online
exercise is something should yet to
when i felt scared my mother held me tightly
the author did a great job fixing these into the story to make it flow very well
if we looked back in time one would need to travel to a doctor and pay to have your problem checked out
we were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport
that there means that there is no way to from it
the climate in the story also becomes difficult
dear  you look on a map of your effect all you see is computers everywhere
the books that were found offensive should not be read at all
the hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising
second some people would try to band a book just to start drama
a major fear among the parents is the inappropriate language or scenes that be described in books
computers kept our relationship healthy and i do not think it would have been that way without them
censorship will block out inappropriate parts of books movies music and magazines in order to make these materials more suitable for all age groups
this is why i want to tell everyone about negative effects of the computer on people
now i talk to him all the time
this is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time
the author is relating to that when the geese are ready they will come back when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow
whether its listening to music playing games or talking with friends you will always have fun on the computer
finally there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other
libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature
when you video chat you can have a conversation with some on class on video
in that time you could be spending time with your precious little girl or even the best friend out side in nature having fun
it is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and description of his life at home
most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow
now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad
i think you should consider less computer time
even nature suffered from the advent of computers
also my views on censorship in libraries
my car is remotecontrolled
thus a poor but healthy man is better than a rich but sick man
he describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now behind him
eight out of ten surveyed by the national nature admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer
one very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert
kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to
blessed are those who have good neighbors
which i doubt it is
for example my stepbrother is always on the internet now
i can connect to that because i used to be a user of the computer and my guardian would yell at me because of it
i just do not think it is right for little kids to see that when there looking for a book or a book about their favorite animal
since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events
the computer can teach us many new and exciting things
him it could have 
if you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle
they are now always inside on their computer
is a subject too graphic for students
this include learning about people
websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful
we walked to the school compound
but instead is composed of those whom you love and who love you
everyone can use the computer for communication with friends or family

r is for restricted to people under seventeen without an adult present  is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult
she will never know unless they meet us somewhere
disagree with me that is alright but have you ever stopped to think about issues like this
there is games you can play quizzes you can take and you can chat with your friends
he still never wants to see is father but what he is doing is the same thing that his father also did
library censorship everyone has their favorite book
the last point i will make is that no information is bad information
computers we use them everyday
putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs
these subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst
she i nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home
it was a pleasant day
libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of
early in the morning
states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing
i wanted to sit in one of those big planes
you still have time to change your life and say no to the computers
once your child finally cooperates they will get the to use the computer
he is doing something that be lovers is heading for a beautiful destination and has found a short cut to save him hours of time
lastly the rough road affected the cyclist
the text states the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
and they will go out and do anyways
last my friend on a business trip the was for weeks she missed him a lot mom let she was able to would have a telephone call
i think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy
there are about fifteen thousand books in the librarythe principal of my school is a very good administrator
little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff
i would keep all types of books in my school if i were the principal of my school
i think computers are an important part of a persons daily life
since i live by myself in  i miss my family a lot
some you could save important from your past
i know kids in school use foul language all the time
he had been hitting his water bottles pretty regularly because of this
teenagers well and do while playing game talking to
setting plays a crucial part in the cyclists mood and energy
being on the computer can even effect your social life
as her mother begins to plant the flower a winter hibiscus she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test
substitute other objects or ideas with this if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity violent slogans or jargon
settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive
to like or hate what ever is on the shelves
but i figured it out she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car
the library just gives us facts about what we need to know about a person or anything like that
i believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive
the computer enables us to find information for a project or construct a diagram or data table for a survey
do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom
i hope you think of computers the way i and millions of other people do
not only do computers teach skills and work they are very fun too
talks about sex
they can only do something about their children are doing
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town
computers are like digital encyclopedias which has just about all the information your looking for
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy enjoyable and worth living
the type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and mood
well that is my opinion on what i think should happen
spending time with family
is not the answer
so its pretty much a lazy distraction
so why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people
something that is offensive to one person not be to another
the third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what they could get and made their house into a home
some people like looking or reading things like that
the internet truly is an amazing tool
censorship cannot be seen as the norm
one mood that the author had was happy
all you have to do for that is go on the compute and look it up
its also good for business men because they count on computers for all there files
the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason
the library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day to day basis
everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like
computers also allow people to work easily
computers organize data by keeping documents in different files computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career
the setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people
the mood the author portrays is love and unity
i actually enjoy family parties
computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything
sets such an ecstatic mood that the reader wants to be there at his home
it could prevent you from spending time with family and friend and can even push them away
had the town been thriving he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish
books are often written for the enjoyment of the reader and if not that books are for informational purposes
when changes happen with the hibiscus changes happen in the story
so have kids stay away from offensive materials
also on you can message friends too
this helps us increase our hand eye coordination because it helps us think about what letters we are typing the letters on the keyboard and push them
i do think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well
he was sweating and getting dehydrated id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst
clad in rags shivering in cold they could be seen everywhere begging in the name of god
this could make a child have in decide between a whole family to  friends and family are essential in life and computers put those in jeopardy
if you think back what had helped you complete the paper
my friend spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside
and if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape how will it ever stop
dear editors i was planning on taking a trip to 
that is why we should have computers and use more
lastly computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages
i have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising
when it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed
to begin computers help to reach  children and even adults the skill of typing
some say they are helpful to society and others say not
all i have to do is go online click my chat box and click their name and then 
he is the only son of our family
along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots
he loves me too
well i think they have a positive effect on people
what would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice but it turned out to be the worst place ever
social lives are very affected by what they learn and how they learn the material
of coarse every library has books that cover all kinds of topics
the cool relaxing air at the beach is much nicer than a dark stuffy room with just the glow of a computer
this year my brother and my closest cousin to me went to college
also while refilling he encounters hazards such as short rolling hills through ghost the terrain and ever a snake
saving trees help us stay alive
many more jobs are being created because of this technology
if the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing
no responsible parent would be caught dead with a year old on an adult website and computers make it harder such parents to do so
so i think that this is a good way to talk to them
in conclusion kids spend to much time on computers
is not the only person this has happened to
well that needs to change
this the the thing that i find most disturbing about some materials
my final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library
such as a family reunion a family vacation and many more
if you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect
but mainly because of the recent issue
they continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events
some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self
in my opinion people would be better off without them
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better
family say your child is out school day
the ability us to get more education
the reason for this is so she will have time to adjust
and when he arrive at the bait shop
writing so you can hear me out on what i have to say and persuasive you on this essay
but they took it off the shelves
people have to be careful of what they say and i feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging
first i would like to tell about the things you can do you can play basketball handball hang with your friends
taking away music
read on and see why i disagree
why would anyone else want the opposite
this quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water
computers are essential to people all around the world
they going to hear it anyways so why try to stop it when there going to end up hearing it
have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends
but you have to go shopping
mu mom just wanted to learn about so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer
but there was mud everywhere
no one deserves to be offered the damaging violence of uncensored books and music
some people would find the example offensive or out of line
there are a few mango trees in my garden as well
these benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why i support the advances in technology
i that if people want to use computer they can
the friends and relatives are missed the most
but we just cant get the nerve to do it
all of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many ways
computers make things easier for people but they are also too dependent on
but little did i know she woke up and me watching this horror film called 
there are the reasons for why i believe you should go for the cause of computers
she often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life
they can help us with many things above and beyond
one of the best ways are on the computer
some people were standing in a queue
furthermore we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information
some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is
the internet even encourages you to get outside and see things for yourself
i am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them
also possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone what do you do then
in conclusion i hope you take all that i have said to heart
not everyone is offended by the same material
therefore we should buy and readonly good books
well i hope you think about what i told you and take it into consideration
i believe that libraries should provide any kind of book magazine music and movies to the public despite if they are found offensive
my family used to spend a lot time together but because the computer i never get to do anything with my family now
what if it messes up their childhood
when i go to the library i think i would mind is i saw some thing
reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide
the computer allows you to connect win people who live faraway with out having to travel to them
the end when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically
if a person hears about a book that be found offensive to them why would they read the book
to learn something that you did not know or to build on knowledge that you already had
this affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament
there are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting
dear newspaper i think that there are many reason why computers are good for people
to let the general public check out
the reason i say this is because is important to spend as much time with family and friends instead of being on the computer 
this creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them
i believe that not all books should be banned but some books should
the owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library not the customers
the computer shows what man kind is capable of doing
they should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this
sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say
computers also help kids spell better
you use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc
without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have 
in paragraph  the author writes about the closeness and kindness of his neighborhood
for example he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed
he followed the short cut that some old men gave him instead of taking the longer route
further sites like  or where you have you own page post your own opinions
this game develops team spirit
how would it be if everyone liked the same things
a computer also helps a students interact with friends
the whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors
dear local newspaper you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people
i think having computers are good because you can use it to find places
many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them
lastly finding information is so easy with a 
we cannot save our kids their whole life so over time we have got to let them grow up
also if you are a parent that has children they always need help
he does not misuse the facilities provided to him
for example a student could have a project over 
adults can help prevent harmful information from all children
some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive
my last opinion is if we have computer
were did you turn to
we should not have an eye on other’s wealth
do you want any thing like that ever to happen to you or your family
magazines can help us with research or just to now what is happening in this world today
it talks about the endless celebrations and countless congregations of family and friends
if someone of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion then they have an option to not read or look at it
when the school started my father took me to the principal
in this memoir there are many moods created by the author
she says here let me help you mother
classical rock and blues are some examples
he falls in love with a man named and begins to have sexual relationships with of the men in his cell
another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left
finally a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something
those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country
only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer
everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life
if someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves
they control life in the major part
a library is built for other people enjoyment
dear  computers are a sought after item in this day in age and we are making advances in technology every single day
with computers people are the will exercise
i am discussing
letting them grow up as innocent as possible
dear  name us from  
since the are just as equal to everyone else
i stated my reasons why i think computers have a negative effect on people
she also misses her family and how they look and dress
magazines is a big one
 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people
without computers to video chat with grandma i have no communication with her they one or two times a year
i think that we as a good country should make sections into what people can read and cant read and it should depend how old is the person
and to her grief
so i honestly feel that libraries for the way they are is to be left alone
the internet is a very useful tool to everyone
finally people have perfect opportunities right in front of them
he followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions
computers build up your skills for everything
it satisfies my personal needs of exercising
slavery is a strong bold word that represents a horrible thing
this shows how close and kind the neighborhood around the house was
we are not accountable for what other people do
a child was left inside the house
also it helps you meet new friends and to keep in touch with them in the long run
the censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already
i believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people
adults know more about the harmful language but why influence them to write the bad things or comment using mean tones
if you want you can also get a web cam
she offered me a small chair to sit on and enjoy the dance
he is a middle aged man
i say this because if you think about it could in a factory is ran by some type of computer
just we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our 
the library in the town that i live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers
if we see a book with a title that sounds like might be offensive then we should just walk past 
nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours
dear  i agree that computers are benefits society
should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries
each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child
also about black never win a trial and there treated unfairly
when people get so involved with something its hard to back away
there should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern
the mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone
these people also have no time for their outdoor activities they used to enjoy
in short i do not believe that libraries should be censored rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents
in conclusion the memoir has a good and happy mood to it
the school board did not even care though
also computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends homeworkresearch games bored and work
these glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot he was running out of water and there was rough terrain
everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you
many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future
also of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework
further more not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so
this memoir to me was like taking a list of things and putting them into a full paper
stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured
if people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else
they had to face racism
many of them watch these sport on tv and many buy tickets to their gems and matches
experts should not try to have less people on the computer
this is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars slavery and politics
these computer websites are allowing anyone to talk in people who could have the interest in mind
to whom it  i have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern day computers have on society
the community was close so everyone felt like family
not only should censorship be allowed it should be enforced
computers can even score tests
they provide books movies magazines music and computers for you to locate something you are looking for
those movies are rated for a reason
its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter
the word serenity gives the affect of calm and peace
thank you for taking your time reading this and i hope you do agree with me
my we should keep computers because we
that is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist
however i believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions
i have never in my years of seen a book or heard of someone who saw a book that offended them
my first reason why i think the effects of computers are good because you can get a lot of knowledge from it
many books movies and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive
also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat
i could hear the strong icy wind blowing outside
for example i have family in another country and one way we always talk is on the computer
the mood is portrayed as happy and thankful about the lessons his parents taught
everyone has different point of view
kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air
our parents are the ones whom we interact with daily
taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it
for a long happy life
they should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it
the books are there for entertainment
books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong
the word has greatly changed
in the middle of the story the mood is strong and determined
the plant signifies her memories
overall computers are a very beneficial tool in our society
people are so caught up with computers their desire for starts to fall
on the other hand though computers open up new worlds to people
the cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out
a computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination
thank you for reading this and have a nice day
an elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had
question is  is everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if there found offensive
that is one reason computers are bad
therefore whats around us affect us as in education friendship and survival
maybe a friend can help with homework
this way young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading
this is not good
nobody just sits home and does nothing those days
my cousin is now and he used online dating and met this really sweet and pretty girl that lived nearby
do you want that to change
so the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors if it is contained within your library
a computer can tell you just about anything you need to know
you will have no worries then
trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time
next computers also allow people to learn about other faraway places and people
over the internet you can research everything from the main staple of the diet in all the way to the day the new year in 
we need more good things to influence our children
lastly taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important
he listens to my problems very patiently and helps me to solve them
you would want the best for you child to not see read watch and listen to things that are inappropriate
another reason i think its such a lead idea is you do not get to enjoy nature
teachers can have students do projects about different countries on people and the student can easily that the information on the computer
there are all kinds of fun games you can play and some even let you compete with other people around the world
she herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see
there are many of them books also
i know i do it all the time
so practically shes stating once everything come back to life then shell feel like she will pass it next time
computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures
what will you choose
it is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb
aim is a good way to talk to friends and plan get together
the problem with censorship is that a could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves
or just shows in general
as an active member of the computer i take part in all negative factors
i think they are good because they help kids with social skills they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world
a child could easily ask an older friend to check the book out for them so they could read it later
this happen by letting the computer be your constant companion
people use them to talk to friends and family online
the trains were moving very fast and people were travelling hanging by the bars of the footboards
if we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library
this definitely shows how much he loved his family home and friends and how they taught him how to care for and love others
my dear mother had come home
the sun was beginning to beat down
today japan is one of the most prosperous countries in the world
well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future
second they are creating a unsafe environment
it was a big change for them to be in a one room apartment to a room apartment
i shall take an interest in my work
this quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them
movies are something that people love to watch come on we pay to get onto see them sometimes
this again saw how grateful the author is
just think a sales person for instance
parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning everyday
most books even if they say one to two choice words it turns into an adult book
my father gave up his career and my mother gave up her family to give me and my brothers a better life
his attitude changed greatly throughout the story
all of these and more give you the opportunity to chat with friends living far away
computers are electronic devices all information stored as patterns of electrical pulses
there is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational
now a days we do a lot of online shopping
so this are some reason why many people decide to be on computer
the author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release
whether it is because it helps people get their work done
public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored this includes public libraries retail stores the internet and 
she had great neighbors
they are meant for learning purposes and for work or school
its good to go on the computer for a little a bit but your on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat
a second way to communicate with friend is by  a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country
because then things can get out of control
this also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about
some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages such as  or 
if this continues it lead so far that the libraries would have to be closed
is one reason why i think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature
the snake charmer was clad in dirty kurta and pyjama
childhood is really the golden period of one’s life
the great thing about you is you can find the information fast and easy
here his hope returns as he finds a rather modern bathroom where he can stop to get a drink
computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things
take for example a child that is six years old and can do whatever he or she wants
for example my cousin used to be an outgoing friend person
in this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth
each individual has their own opinion of each material
 radio books movies magazines would all be uncensored
in conclusion this is how the setting affected the cyclist
this lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on
second it would take a lot away from history
really the band talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live
the only man to live a perfect life was and was in a human body
i highly doubt it
another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that most likely the entire book magazine movie etc
we had a trainer with us
the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset
they feel it should be locked away as if it were some eyesore
we as a planet need to turn to  the only good thing
also every year you hear someone or them well most of the time it is because of 
now lets say the wiring in your lights get messed up
like foreign places or movies
you have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive
to click on something you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen
another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country
some books and music do have contents that are offensive to some readers and viewers
as you can see those are just a few reasons i think that computers have a positive affect on us
have their own
but i think that need to cut down on the use of electronics
this is why the books should be out in the open for all to see but taken to a secluded section
do you turn it off and waist your money not doing anything about it
no i do not think they should be removed
so why not the freedom of writing
i know this from some clues in the text
it is hot cool out therethen the terrain changed
for example people that have businesses they are going to need computers
the setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot dry and nothing around
nothing because there is freedom of speech
for example when you have an essay to right about 
it is a very horrible thing to learn
it would just be a click away
i ended up doing all their work
the teddy’s body is very smooth and soft
one of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with friends
  and are great ways to keep in touch with other people
even in school systems librarians are there to guide kids to read good books
the motivation is the flower bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her
i think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries
they have a right to write and we have a right to read and no one should take that right away
their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read
the aid of technology our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist
its not impossible
the teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students
last is the freedom of speech of the author of the book
so in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source so the cyclist is being affected by all of this
when people push aside their social time for computer games chat rooms or movie websites they lose a large portion of their life
you will not want them listening reading or watching the things you watched as a child
another feature that affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade
no matter how gruesome or vile of a description a book can give it still does not compare with the visual picture of a video
the sunny hot weather will affect his will to ride
this is a disgrace to the school
sure it might be pricey to
picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too to find that their child has been bullied to death it really hurts them
just imagine late at night pm no library no computer and a giant essay due tomorrow
so instead those people could just quickly and easily send a email no instant message to who ever they need to talk to
when its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good about taking the test over again
it can be seen how work gets done faster however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing
they sacrificed so much for him
but there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way
computers are addicting also because of online computer games
computers can be useful and have some benefits on the other hand they are harmful and they should not be used as often
the are websites for kids like games there are teen games there are adult games
they take away and diminish time interacting with family and seeing the world
the computer can really amp up your social life
dear  have you ever noticed how different our society is today even from just ten years ago
i think that there are many different few from many different people on books
or maybe a local gym
not only has this computer crashed once but twice
let finished up
the clerks take their own time in verifying and registering
dear newspaper computers does have some cons but they also have a lot of pros
its a scary though because these children are our future leaders
my personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to different people more variety and different reading or viewing materials
some magazines have really offensive things in them that people in the real world say
a very pregnant woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements
computers discourage exercise cut down the number hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste money and space
you could think before you reply and most people online talk or write way differently there then in person
there was no water to be found and the terrain is were rough and bumpy
all freedoms are taken away by that one word
these are my reasons computers have terrible effect on people
computers are not worth your children at
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and kind for many reasons
this is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up
friend was dumbfounded
many play cricket basketball soccer or tennis
also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations
computers not only let students write reports they also allows them to save them for future uses
a few extra types
many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that that is how they spend their free time
i feel that if you find something to be offensive then don read or watch it
and these setting could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay
he is also enjoying having his family always at their home
even though this be true there are other way you can do this
others though say that censorship is unnecessary because people are going into the library and looking for a book at their own risk
first the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things
i think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world
the author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending
i feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others
the government is trying to make the children of less corrupt but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways
studies show that computer games are better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets
do not take the books off the shelf maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be
so to the  computers help our society thrive
a man says
so computer have chipped into that
computers help us do that
by use of the word will the author shows the girls determination
lastly people can learn about where their family corner form
i urge you to use your computer less and exercise see family and enjoy nature
in the today we have something called freedom we exercise this right everyday with what we wear and what we say
if you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that not be offensive at all
they thought it was bad for kids to listen to
with a computer these are some things that you will be able to do
this sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm
we all enjoy having the freedom to read listen and watch what we like
how could they talk in front of the teacher
go run outside
if the government would assign someone to censoring books magazines or music there would be a uproar
if everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure
authors are artists
libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge
censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method
he or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable
i believe computers allow people like myself to learn
in from home the blueprints of our lives the author creates a warm and loving mood
we have learned many things from it
in conclusion these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting
every person poses their own opinions on life
what ever happened to spending time with family and friends
if you have friends or family far away then you can keep in touch with them without leaving your house
second when she bought the plant her mother was a little angry because it was expensive
she said now all the new things seemed weird to her when she first got here  but now they are second nature to her now 
the next time you are in the library looking for a book ask your self one question is it to offensive to be important
i could sure use your help because these are some really long lists
this permission slip will and can be used for all movies
 and they will most likely not know to say at that moment
in conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story
after feeling that the direction might be rough he rode out of pride to get to his destination
you can argue if something is mediocre is offensive i will argue back just because i have the right to voice my opinion as you do
the mood of the in the memoir is happy and grateful a quote for being grateful is is paragraph 
another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends
according to  out of students choose what college to go to first by checking its website
this quote also shows a loving mood as well
electronics kids sit on the computer all day long while they should be out exercising and keeping fit
one way is to be respectful to people and people be respectful back
he said i will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home
however there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they want
they get the magazines and drool over how the center fold looks
during winters he grows peas a farmer lives a simple life
imagine you go into your favorite library and you go to grab your favorite book or movie and its not there
you can talk to people without the expensive phone bill
this proves that certain items like books movies and music should not be taken off the shelf
computers are bad because they can become a computer
we need to something about these computers
people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them
the plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus
they help pay taxes
another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer
if you need directions you can look it up on the computer
without the computer how would our willing people help the rest of the world or even know about the rest of the world
what if at you job you need the internet
he considered his neighbors his family
so much so that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting
if that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section
you can tell someone what is going on and call the cops
it improved his baseball career by throwing and catching the ball and increased his grades in school
lastly school was computers 
while some people complain others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report
computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world ability to learn about very interesting facts and they allow people talk online too
there are many people who actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library
is life filtered and censored
censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading
this wonderful network is here in our computers
it is not difficult to do like writing a letter would be so people can communicate more efficiently and easily
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
my last reason is that computers are the general health of people today
my cousins saw an article about once and they thought it was amazing they learned a lot about the culture there and actually took a trip there
the author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life
many people fall asleep to soothing instruments that make a beautiful melody
the are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world
the rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit
also many people have important information on a computer
if people removes them so people wont come back to that libraries
i was always the youngest out of the people i hung out with
first of all computer are very helpful with typing skills
i have always thought of that question
that is just too much
even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go i do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point
the mood created in this article is a joyful mood
the older generations lived a happy not violent life
the weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability
in the memoir of  the author shows a lot of mood throughout the story
people are offended by many things every day in life
first computers are a great source to do school work on
my second reason is work
when we are assigned a project we need to do research on a topic and the fastest and easier way is by computer
one person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book
more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals
i would get the cooperation of all my staff members
and learn about new things everyday
this sets similarities from their old home to their new home
maybe if we could make a petition and have at least people sign it then the book could be removed
a public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers
a place where people live and get shelter is a house there are two kinds of houses
do you seriously want to be the last one left behind
this delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well
saying that i believe that we should not be able to ban censor or remove any books music or movies from the public
rest is good also
this is a perfect way for communication and business
she feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home
the last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp
he is thirtyfive years old
made by  claims to be the most popular  online  on the web
in my opinion the act of removing books from a library says just that
when seeing and hearing things children start to believe it
voice were raised
also many people have an email
i think done all i could
his head struck against the ground
however should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age
if ask an adult how ever they are most likely going to say yes
this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world
they have the same affect
right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of juices and dreams
for their spelling will soon become and the vocabulary will be or all in slang
no one would like that
there are sections for young adults mature adults children non fiction fiction science fiction and so on
there are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display
would the decide for us
i think that it was there home and each other because they have there home just as they like like like when they were back home
to be able to do so much with just a couple clicks new that i find extravagant
they give us so many such good things and yet expect nothing in return
communication is not as easy to do by phone anymore because people are always busy and on the computer
they just recently got back from their honeymoon
he said using the internet also saves more time
there have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past
all this would happen because he was on a computers
that is why the author ended the story in this way
dear local newspaper you think computers are great for everyone
to completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them
they give us the ability to learn about things
it also teaches you how to type fast
so what are you waiting for go out and go your computer today
i hope you now understand my position on computers
almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it
what is you method of learning
or what if your computer brakes
dear local newspaper computers are used everyday by millions of people
computers show these advances greatly
it makes the reader feel admiration towards his parents and the author is trying to create a sense of appreciation and gratitude towards his parents
they never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her
what affected the cyclist most i think was when he arrived at the bait store
he had various points in support of his belief
they need water to survive especially during their long bike ride
so with a computer nearly impossible not to be able to keep in touch
imagine what else could happen by staying of computers
i really feel like am on both sides
why would anyone do this to themselves
but it does happen
the mood in the memoir is love family and happiness
many features of the setting affect the cyclist
people who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf
you could understand more about plants and animals
then leave it alone
the is a published work whether it is religious or not
we do not need movies like this in our public library
the mood created by the author is a happy reflective memoir on the family life of the author growing up
he wears a white uniform to school
that is meaning they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at there stuff
children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time
some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing
do you the fair people our nation wish to be responsible for such a catastrophe
now would you censor that
if we hear about something wrong in our world today we need to act
a library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is
also it brings us together to have a family movie night
also his mood is from the music
however this does not mean that the libraries of should get rid of these books videos etc
i believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing but can go too far
if not everybody would get bored of the same books
he understands that they only left for his benefit and he appreciates that
and i would like to let you know what i think about the whole situation
many people also speed up their word by using the computer
people talking each other on line is just another way how computers benefit society
there are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves
but computers effect people the most
through ideas such as this you are not only taking knowledge but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation
there are a lot of websites that are educational things on the computer are worth having
i strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in
the computer is perhaps the greatest form of the world has ever seen
we know so much more about other places now than we did before computers
sh might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would over come being upset about the test
this complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out
thing about his setting that changed was the hills
i go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too
some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them
a lot of peoples time
in against it and ill you why
he was always happy to be around family and friends
so all this puts affect on him from just whats around him
the author was getting neat stroke being passed by desert snakes and tumbleweeds
now just imagine how much money our society would gain after year
they help people learn new things
those who support advance in technology believe that computers have a positive affect on people
i think that it benefits us all
what if the library is closed if you do go then you wasted some time
when it comes to music and books they are wonderful learning tools also good for expression of ones self
halfway through his trip the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
in my opinion i think computers do
these are some moods that the author was trying to show
the also spoke about his parents and there life
next up is the rough terrain
but no matter what you try to do something bad will be out there waiting for you
businesses thrive in other countries
addiction online bullying and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a  there are many more
in movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention
newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch
when on the computer your not really interacting with
as you of all people can see many don think too much about time
he should grow into a good citizen with a great admiration for everything good in life
dear  there has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society
most said it was flat but later came to know that it was not
you can have and download musics to something or go to web sites that have musical on them
having an endless source of information in your own home
another positive fact about computer is that you can find all the information you need and fast
to take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives
too many children are being bullied online and they are being hurt
i will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason
these online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure
for example in the story when he enters the fork in the road it says he found several rusty pumps and one ramshackle shed
you can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead
now some parents have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book but parents should have control over their kids
libraries have movies that are rated     or 
out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months
lastly there are many students and teachers who teach and learn online
also now you can buy food on internet and lots more
everyone has a different view on something that is what started this issue in the first place
overall most kids in the have heard offensive language or graphic content
the path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight
computers can keep friends together and save families from drifting apart
in every way the plant is in the same circumstances as main character and the last paragraph is used to link them
when it comes down to it people are just going to have to get over not having their way because they want a book removed from the shelf
i think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house but in the neighborhood as well
people need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport
many people had come there for a picnic
if we decide to take one book off of the shelf then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty
that is how the terrain affects the cyclist
authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons
between winter and summer seasons there is a short period called ‘spring’
no parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex and drugs they saw in a book at school
show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with
after that my father bade goodbye to the principal and went away
they can provide tons of information normally unobtainable
despite what people believe though computers are very good for our daily lives
some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable
 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop
but i do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it
there is a mood of love too
online shopping can be very helpful
it also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family and are necessary for many jobs
computer presents to kids through
so the computer is necessary for to function as well
if everything offensive were to be taken away what would be left
these children are exploring the literature world to learn and grow
i feel very happy in his company
the place was crowded
their house is like a fish market
also where he live helps the mood
 computers make it simple to learn new information about many things such as people and places across the globe
therefore kids will get into trouble for a stupid thing
books are everywhere and people have every right to read whatever they please
they still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies
why did the author have to throw this in the book
in conclusion being online too much has an effect on everybody and
but without this device what would they be able to do
not just person should be able to talk for everyone
he respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him
secondly they are too time consuming and thirdly computers are too expensive
although technology is progressing computers are only the basics
eventually i came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book
materials bring all different kind of subjects and stories for everyone
also if kids need to search from school then they can also do that there are many reasons why people should get computers
there are not a lot of songs in the world that do not involve language drugs or sexual content in it
this exert from the test supports my previous statement about how its hot because the speaker tells us how hes sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage
the computer is an easy alternative for communication
children need to be protected from materials that hurt them in some way
then what is next
this makes it much easier than to fly half way across the 
every person that goes to a library should have the right to educate themselves on others religions
information processing is about computer
computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do
if a movie is rated it should not be in a public library
our body is a wonderful creation of god
the cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink
secondly i would talk about people who talk online way too much
all you need is a computer
yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment
this is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life
this is on issue that needs attention
computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish
or your daughter from looking at porn
obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to disease
to looking at websites
their library card would show their age and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young
they do more bad than good in my opinion
is that the world we want for kids
to me that sounds crazy
computers can be negative thing or positive
was i ever under the influence
imagine you writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday
the reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle
he provides us with the food we eat
makes the story happy by saying how great it was to grow up with his family
also dreams can some true for people that never have the chance to follow 
i know even more than 
so why would we want to take them away
in a survey out of of people rather go on the computer then take a walk in as parts
i strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down
we can reject we can ignore or we can absorb and interpret
like for instance music
many people have different views on different types of things
some people who are obsessed it can be problematic
computers hurt society more than it helps
computers have entered our world and have altered all of our lives
this can be very dangerous
through magazine movies music and books are ways you can find them out
for three reasons really the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have
the geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time
there is a new look everywhere on earth
but there is a main reason
computerized can take over jobs quicker easier and cheaper
it can cause health problems and even problems in general
if parents do not want their child to read something then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book
this makes computers a negative influence on people  their health
how will children learn about what goes on in if they are not shown
are offensive then you really got to take action
in the memoir the author also tells about his extreme thankfulness towards his parents
well i know i 
the internet has a massive effect on us
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills it will take him longer to reach his destination
the library is open to anybody that wishes to enter
people are not going to look at things the same
you could go on the internet
the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym
third computers lets people talk to other people online
it is your choice in what you want to read listen to or watch
the last way the computer helps out the its with box from there
my first views on this subject is that computers are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on
find something more common towards your own interest
the spring is a time for archetypal rebirth
but if you going to go on to just go on to just talk to friend then that is a waste of time in somebody life
dear  we all know more and more people are using computers
he is clearly grateful for his enviable childhood and cares dearly for his selfless parents
 technology has developed majorly these past decades
since then problem has grown to a point that we will never be able to control
“an eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind
since he is talking about his family of course he is going to loving
the mood in this memoir i believe is appreciation and caring towards others
by having a computer you can chat with them through your webcam
young adults play video games read books in school related to 
its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated
books should not be banned because if they were then we would be ruining the future for others and we would be destroying our own future
to many people other than myself would agree with that
knowing your running low of water to feel sorry for himself the cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to rolling hills
computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they just have
it is how others think about what is out there in these libraries not what you think
i believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things
those situations can all put you in a really tough place
so what seems to be offensive to people
books such as gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories of which some cant read
computers can help people learn about news in the world places and people
they can receive them and also send pictures back
i remind you that computers benefit many jobs in and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know
you know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day
growth is not meant to be limited nor is freedom
more insulting than finding books of issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately
this problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that on average spend and a half hours a day on the computer
my friend  found disturbing to look at some pictures because showed blood
but with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water
children everywhere are being influenced by books magazines movies and even songs
part of what make a good work great is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers
even if your not doing school work you can find anything on the internet
i was shocked and embarrassed
the library is a place where our free will comes into play
to were no little kids can rent the book
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way
i have three reasons to support this statement
so please read this carefully and i hope what i have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things
lastly everyone needs to enjoy nature

but just because one parent does not want their child to read   does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it

as someone once said  who do not know their history are bound to repeat it
you find a place you go on find good write come down yet of of the computer finish paper get grade that is good feel happy the end
libraries are serious places and should be treated as such
most people think that computers are just new helpful technology but there is more to it than just that
if libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive there would be nothing left people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century
everyone was in a hurry
except for my eyes
computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do
this brings me to say that books music magazines newspapers etc
the last reason why we should have computer
some parents feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them
such as pictures of nature celebrities
she gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test 
again you thought wrong
all these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now

its your choice decide
the mood that is presented is happiness
whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else
lastly worry about your family grades and health than some useless game
computers could also be used for bad reasons
parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous
this is why i support the computers
after eating fruits we played a lot of games
after an hour’s effort they were finally able to control the fire
finally as i had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important
features we find in many railway stations

on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures
elders have better knowledge than us
there are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library that does not mean you have to read all of them
to remove such things from the library would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body or hearing a curse word
what would our forefathers think of what censorship has become
this is what i think the computers effects have on people
indian culture clearly defines the importance of expressing love and obligations towards our parents
it made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first
making sure children cannot reach these materials is a concern
today many people are able to learn about that due to computers
and make everyday tasks simple
also i could see what the news are and i could contact teachers through the computer
an ideal citizen is a thorough gentleman
for some books this can take years
that is called being selfless
the snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year
aim  and are all different ways to interact with each other
computers help people communicate with other people
me as a child a is throwing me off of my homework
however these books who many find offensive could also be beneficial to its readers

the trees retain carbon and release oxygen for the use of living beings
before computers became popular people had to work and look for 
libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society
we could do tests on computers
their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love but curiosity does grab every child now and then
helps to maintain strong bones
take it away
also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant in which her mother is shocked about
there are different kinds of butterflies in our country
rough roads did as well
i know that a lot more kids too because i was reading in a magazine that of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer
computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication
the question then is computers have good effects or bad effects on people
in this post decade the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up
not everyone likes the same things
books although very rarely have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world
one big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear not always knowing the full story
but how do you get to your boss
explicit material is available everywhere you look
for example he says over one long crippling hill hes saying the hills are very hard for him
computers are an excellent source of knowledge but that could be a problem
should books music movies and magazines be removed if found offensive
the books could be a school assignment
you can also see each other through a webcam
i love traveling
my final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries
in summary computers should not be used in excess
finally computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business
he was running out of water so he got desperate for some
computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world
computers make people spend a lot time have dangerous risks and take away interaction time
she hopes when she is happy
that is their freedom of speech
it is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them
about half way through the paragraph was when the memoir started to get very 
you see there are many things you can do other than going on the computer
first off i like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view
and how his simple three room apartment has become a home
books music movies and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time
therefore new exercises moves or tricks online can help them out a lot
the rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing
so i say every library stays the way they are now and keep every book they have for all kids and adults
with all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures
in our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things and we are able to like what ever we want
another setting i feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path
lastly computers can just be plain fun
computers help people with working learning and even communication
they make you a welldisciplined person who obeys the leader and the rules
you could use your webcam and talk to them and see than like you were in the same room
and in a way thanks his parents for everything
take this letter into consideration
when cycling or doing any outdoor sport the setting matters greatly
i understand that people might have been there first
some ask what a library is well they are good places to go
i know that many people pay their bills online
the computer makes work and studying fast and simple
as the cyclist rides to his destination he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings
when you go to a new country you also get the opportunity to meet new people
in conclusion i think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library
i do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive
there are more than six billion people in the world
prayer works wonders
finally the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp
my brother told me not to make any noise
other people like the book you hate
the text says the speed limit was 
we remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole
meet some people
see libraries have many things to do
people should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life
so why should we force others to believe something we think
so i hope you enjoyed reading essay
everyone that has used it said it really improved there reaction time
i have to disagree with the supporters of technology
coming from a teenage perspective at a young age i was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me
thanks for reading them and have a nice day
he then goes to the fields
you can go online and get pictures games videos music or even directions to a place
the material also should be removed if it is offending someones race
even though it might seem unfair censorship given by the parents and guardians is very necessary
what i considered their aloofness was just discipline
the internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want
now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image
the child must be at least in order to get a pass from the parent though
in addition computers teachers in organizing files and entering grades online so students can check their
honestly i have no objections to censorship and other times i do
if everything we read was censored there would be nothing to read
but you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world
i think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test
second people are not enjoying the outdoor
people use the internet to help them
some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier
with this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away
libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner
so what are you waiting for
many of our tribes live inside forests which have trees
the mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented
if you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want
i also find it faster to type then print
this will give her more time to learn  study  hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home
when the cyclist is at his low point he is an abandoned ghost town looking for water that tastes like battery acid
i would have to say no
a test done by showed that teens will rebel times more than usual with the aid of a computer
but there are many other types besides rap
just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away
i believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read so it will be a message
a book is a book to be read
early in the morning the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers
he was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate
this is because a lot of the games can be to much fun that it can be find a game and play it all the time
that was my three opinion on which why computers are good effect on the society and i think that computers are really good effect on the society
nature can affect us in many ways by weather by terrain as in this case by animals
i believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons
viruses can hack you computer steal you personal info and destroy you computer
whether we are reading a book watching a motion picture or even listening to a new music artist our lives are being affected by such media
this is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood
in the memoir i think the mood the author creates is love for family
however i would stop going to the library if that happened
you feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo
we pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors
from these reasons our lives because easy and convenient which is what people strive to accomplish
one should not be ineligible to a book or magazine or watch a movie
you picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall
by email only a couple minutes so you can see that computer also can provide some of safety everybody
they help us research socialize and they help our and economy
a library is a place you can go to read write and relax
i would read books or i would put a puzzle together or something
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
the ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance
with the cyclist having limited amount of water effected him to
other people might enjoy that book
first is the emptiness the feeling that he is all alone
i think that if it is something that offends you then you should just keep going
also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move
the computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far off country
they changed the way people think and how they look at the world
com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time
dear newspaper editor i think we should have internet or computers at our houses
so computers do have a good point to it
almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside
computers could even be used for school work
i share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible
dear  have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer or wishing you were on it
just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate someone else might enjoy it
fortunately there was no loss of life
computers are also beneficial because of what huge resource they are
if your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer
first materials that one individual finds offensive could be viewed another way by many others who enjoy the material
computers improve reflexes and such but you can do that by exercising also
plus computers also help you stay in touch with friends
she was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence
all it is is cause and effect
i probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life
however their information is out of date and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads
first of all computers allow people to meet and interact with other people
while he is riding he sees surrounding him no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
every town i know about has sport fields where many kids and adults of all ages use
since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it
there are words spoken that will offend many
online people can communicate with others
computers inform people about important news
just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same
the computer allows me to do everything i need
this last paragraph is written for several reasons
also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home
it helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath
he has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life leaving no room for anything else
this lowers your ability to do on the test
the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist in a negative way
much of this material be considered offensive to certain people
you even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family
so to sum it all up you can get school work done
he finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink
there would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive
i believe that computers effect most people negatively
or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer
the third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want
for example things such as religion
the words that they say in songs the things we see in movies and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand
when i really wanted a bike i saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday
people also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive
they are so much fun to play and what i am talking about is video games
being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important
do you know anyone in the world that can say the computer is not fun
my name is 
censorship is not only wrong its unnecessary
go ahead get the explicit version of that rap song or sometimes it might already be bad enough
the best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away
it is as simple as that
first of all computers are a great source of communication because if you have a long distance relative that lives in then you can talk to them online
no one can stop what is coming you just have to learn to live with it and move on
a majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this brings
it is exhilarating to watch pouring rain and to run about in it
the bumpy roods and hills make him work harder
for example you might love the computer but that love should not over power your time you spent with your family
computers today are much different from computers back then
after reading all my reasons and opinions i hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries
what if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive
is that true though
books are a key to learning
the author was likely describing his happy 
and then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions
books movies magazines or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public
the reason why is family and friends are distant mood swings can occur and also being overweight finally computers can do a lot of things far
the man got to see his newborn baby and his wife
as if a person that was a cook might not find a book about athletics too appealing either
you can also see pictures of things that you cant see everyday
these are grown ups using the tools available to improve their lives
i remain confined to my room
also one more thing books magazines and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right
many features of the setting of the cyclists excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically
a simple solution is talking online to an actual person who lives in 
if someone finds the book offensive the fault is not of the book being there but of the person being in the wrong section
i believe agreeing with you be a very good choice
the series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers
one way i could describe the memoir is that it makes you fell good about things
this vow at the end of the story shows her willing up to be strong and come through in the end
they know more stuff then my parents and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier
if they have one copy of a book it will begin fights
in agriculture we should not overuse chemicals
he is fourteen years old
the mood created by the author in the memoir is 
the authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story
for the interacting with friends and family you can do that i mean how long can a person look at a computer screen
one night as i was sleeping i heard loud cries of “fire
this shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling
t that could be offensive to anyone particular
the features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling
you can as almost every question and a computer will have it
kids try to learn people talk like websites things that they are not able to and over they can see are on 
i can connect to this because i had a relative who admitted that he gained at least five pounds
this shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much
the children are the future of the world
it would get annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone of three things would happen without computers
as well as pictures blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it
i read or the local newspaper that lots of people use computers and that not everyone agrees that this benefits society
to conclude although some books are offensive to some people and not to others we have to be aware of what cause problems to certain people
in the story winter hibiscus
many people either in school or in the work field will most likely need to research something to get a better understanding
the and i thought up some great ideas while i was and we think for one week in we are going to live without any electricity
in this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time
that could make anyone feel uncomfortable
well if you answered yes stop the computer madness and head on outside
this crusade of theirs posed the questions  can and should be censored
is happy in that memoir because only revisits memories that was fond of
movies would be boring stories would be interesting and there would be no music
they even give smiles to others
libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings any kind every kind
with the help of internet i was able to see a far away place and experience the country as if i was there
they are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test
the author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward
another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels degrees
i strongly disagree with this
it also helps you to look things up like people states and etc
i believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing the internet
but when spring comes shell be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding
people get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese
the first thing i am going to talk to you about is how it is bad
the invention of computers have change our world in a positive way
the library is known to be a place full of dreams and imagination
his parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the barriers to work for their children
in the book a  there is a lot of detailed events that happen
she was talking about the flowers smell compares to her grand mothers shell it was the same
he chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road
i see only a few good points in censoring
so get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive
there are many books over these topics that many people find offensive or just completely oblivious
but a parent might get upset that their child is hearing reading or even seeing these things and might band it from the library
you can go to a different store for enjoyment
when voting on this decision please take part and support advances in technology it will be beneficial to everybody
i know i 
even if you were absent most papers i questions are on the internet so you could make end to the homework
personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun but where does the fun stop
in this memoir the author creates a mood
 but for some reason the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them
he teases the young boys and girls of the locality
by reading books we can develop an positive mind
art should not be censored at all
they claim that these books can be offensive to some and therefore should not be read
just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do
instead of being on the computer all day spending home with family and doing activities with them could be more fun
you can connect with old friends and talk to current ones
the four pillars of religiontruth purity mercy and charitystood firm in all the world
the author concludes this story because it shows her determination
if the snake would have bitten him he could have died from poison
using computer to learn about different places is easy
sports prides its self on that
most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing
even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill
also when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door
my cousin is in college right now and i always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing
this is how the setting affected him
imagination can scare people
dear  are many books music and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes
libraries need to put serious thought into what is on the shelves no matter what form the information is in
so read on i know you will think the same way as me about computers given my knowledge below
the setting had a huge affect on the cyclist
how does cutting out knowledge ever help
on the other hand computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
it is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it
 questions were only used to support my survey the next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer
the author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for
this is because she says that when they come back in the spring which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life
so just do everyone a favor and stop complaining
in my computers class
so maybe things do need to be taken off shelves
only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset
in conclusion i had agree on the statement and my reasons why was because you wont have fun
that family has made that their home forever
i cannot
to learn about far away places is great
as a solution i believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone
for example many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing
he is grateful for that
a lady took a fancy for me
the weather being so hot and humid did not help the cyclist throughout his journey
can literature which is the basis of civilization be censored
the internet allows a more elaborate final draft
although parents care about the things their children read books should not be banned
the familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to take the test again
by censoring what products are published and put in public takes away that right
for example they could need directions or some ones phone number or answers
when seeing the geese and the hibiscus she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time
well then they can use their computer to stay in touch
anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion
after sometime the bride came
the children be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident
more over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds
you also have to be very quite
i would try to make them good citizens
as soon as the recess bell goes the calm of the school is broken
it shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you
all these good people got together and became family
no for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was they will not understand it
the author portrays his love for his parents when he explains how selfless they were in immigrating to  and sacrificing so much for the sake of their children
who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories
there are not for entertainment and things of that nature
make sure they see something fun but with a positive message
i find it much more easy to use a computer for projects and i all of my friends think it is also
no one computer are one of the most useful device ever made
another reason computers are good because they can keep you out of trouble and can keep you entertained
we all have that favorite book mine is  of and 
one reason the mood is happy is because of the setting
things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available
these advances in the technology are making us very selfish
some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject
they would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats
for example you can practice typing up essays and other work projects
can you smell the fresh air it flies around
i bet there are many people that have that same issue
its all about how you take the song when you first hear it and take the messages out of it
computers are an amazing and new technology
a large number of people came to see the fair
so then again you have to have parents permission for that to
here are my detailed reasons
do i believe that some books should be taking off the shelves if they are found offensive 
after the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications
passing on the information can become a conflict and people certainly do no want that
a round the world have asked this or been asked this question
secondly the more time you spend cooped up inside the less time you get to enjoy nature
another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future
on the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family
certain books music movies and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think
i think that should have the freedom to choose what to read watch or listen to
if we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries
going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all
if you are watching a movie on a network like or  those channels censor movies
it definitely benefits society
nobody can tell a book is going to be inappropriate just by looking at the front cover
schools like mine have over a hundred computers but they are only used for education
first of all children often follow after what they see
computers could also help us with our every day life
the main idea here is preferences
as you can see from these examples the memoir had a very thankful and gracious mood to it
these are necessities for all people to have access to
so i hope you have been i know i would have and there is no doubt is my you will make the right choice
my friends blew on whistles when i cut the cake
people would not stand for it
books are history
all the information you could need
such as rated movies that contain things like drug use sexual content and extreme violence
this vocabulary change could be prevented if computer were not used as much
people have to adapt to different cultures if they move
how is a young girl from a small town in supposed to find out how people in live their life
one have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives
another problem with computers is how safe they are
you walk in and take a piece
i feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies
certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of
finally society needs to back away from their computers and stop into
no little kid should be looking at or saying those things
dear  computers are very helpful in daily activities but computers have a bad side
continue to gain weight families fall apart and the economy collapses all because computers
being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage
no two men can be the same
somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite
finding an appropriate book is not the problem
these are only my views on the topic and also these statements are my opinion
yes you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise
the computer provides websites giving information on every time you could think of
people need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachersbut through these tools
what happens when a child wants to know more than she does
act now
so you got my opinion on censorship and i hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer
computers make it easy to communicate
easy access to tons of useful information
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
computers can also be very dangerous
at first he was very motivated determined and hydrated
but others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff
i frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college
when we would arrive home are parents would ask what we saw we would lie and say we saw the new movie
last he proposed
we talk on webcam and chat
put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time
also wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and is sweating and losing water
they show the results or how the situation was handled
have you ever needed to cancel a meeting
i believe if there is something offensive in a movie magazine books or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good
what is the difference
i usually do that so i know when a good is to an in the to buy what i want
some other notable games are   of    and 
the computer would alert the doctors
politicians themselves especially
do you ever want to take that book off the shelf
computers are growing daily
most students find reading to be boring
people would not want them gone if they thought of it the way i do
i do not think they should be removed at all
as long as the music is something positive but there are all kinds
taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it
another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus
for one your eyes will begin to hurt
another issue i have is with sexual content being found in libraries
the narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor
computers is destroying the social life millions of people
this can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need
through reading i have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population
teen often go to the library to meet up with friends or start on homework
a bus stop hums with life and activity
because of the growing population of those who use computers companies tend to make computer shoes which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day
what if your child is cheating
i have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop
keep on the shelf
friends family and exchange students are able to talk and see you through video chat
writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel
he boldly continues forth reaching new terrain rolling hills
made their slave through ignorance
censorship is the underlying problem to many things
to the editor of the daily newspaper i strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages
they can help us learn how to type connect us with our world and bring families closer together
not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them
the students have to pay for the food and stay in the hostel
they can be entertained by online games communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world
i book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive
people use offensive things all the time but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way
i think the memoir has a happy and grateful mood
if you are older then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age
all you have to do is search it on your computer
when is 
we should always ask our parents before we decide on something
communication is one of the greatest things about computers
censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years
i also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this
many say that history repeats itself
as time went on prince siddartha began to realize the suffering of human life
many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up but i disagree
the thing is computers help us with our everyday life
it can warn man of a possible storm
if they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back
this is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to be abandoned or not used
the conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time
new things can be learned from them
people should not have the complete say in the removal of books
every person black white yellow brown or even green has the right to freedom of space
many people take classes especially college level classes online
this makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated
also typing on the computer teaches us hand eye coordination that can help us with other things
reading different types of literature a terrific way of learning and library shelves should be stripped of the books occupying the space
let the people read what they want to read
it presents an opportunity to study human nature
having a good and positive attitude you should see the brighter side of things
they most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them
but sometimes computer are bad because when people go on web sites to chat peoples can be grown ups but talking to little kids
it is just something that we will have to deal with
the cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him
in strong opinion computers are better for the world
he has to evaluate the answer sheets of the students
this document has amendments
in conclusion everything i have said about why being on the computer too long is bad for you proves that too much computer is bad for people
so think are you for or against censorship
bad people are always lurking on the internet and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids
as previously stated in the paragraph above it makes no sense to rid a book just because one person finds it offensive
i learnt a lesson of my life
having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves
i hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live
i think this because it can teach you how to type faster learn about far away places and talk to people online
libraries have a variety of material from books to movies
i am not saying to stop using computers
they might have been old but not very wise
but when i wait for it to load i get bored and go on online game website
so you go to your computer from there
the author really emphasizes how thankful he is that his parents did this for him
no of course not
i think that we should have computers
he looks for a place to cool off and get water which he finally does in the end
the can take videos and pictures as well as play music videos and games
get a computer now
it can also show us the lives about people from the past
for example gay and lesbian marriage peoples thoughts and opinion on this topic
in conclusion this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration
and everyone needs to get past the offensive side and get to a level where everyone sees eye to eye
this passage just completely revealed how much love had been in the air even through those hard times
the authors parents risked so much for their son
censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people
they have to go jump to come another day
also if friends wanted to talk with one another the could instant message each other
this happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers
today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that censorship
yes because what if a year old could find a offensive to have a book that talks about his race in a bad way
he is very popular among students
this was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water
the point is is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library
we need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal
with modern technology the world is better connected and united
if everybody spent less hour on the computer they could save off their electric bill
first of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise
another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction
all of that shows how during this memoir his mood is happy loving and grateful all at once
also every thing they get from the computer you get from book
but using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct
tennis also increase your heart rate  burn fat cells to help you lose weight
everyone in the world has different opinions
would be censored
the possibility of defeat should not unnerve us
computers can help open people up to unique genres of music they have never listened to before
lastly us kids need computers to type essays prompts or papers for each class
most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated
when you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen
the cyclist is lost has only found dirty water and is moving on rough ground
why cant the world be more open
his very happy he came from such friendly family
to the past stressed because i never had a to just relax and think about things i computer doing something or homework
also you can get information on places you will visit
even if its war movies its telling what these men have gone through and they fought and lost there friends
it is simple if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books do not read them
some might argue that though
most books have a true story behind them and i believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life
also you can find free work out videos
peoples language could be different or there personality
movies movies movies
those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip
just keep the peace and give everyone what they want
movies have a protection against this called ratings
will our freedom of speech be negated or our freedom to assemble
we can also get postcards inland letters and envelopes at these windows
not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human
the conclusion mentions the test again
people have the right to know everything
they placed the offerings of sweets in front of the goddess
therefore they very beneficial to the world its people and technology
computers can be real great and easy to use as you can see for schoolwork
guaranteed years from now we will still be using computers they are probably talking to friends doing research on something or are typing up something for 
or say you were watching a show that was talking about slavery a hundred years ago would that anger you
i tried a drop or two tasted like battery acid
at the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map
it would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it
they breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen that sustains our life
obviously computers are growing exponentially in popularity
people can use the internet to send emails to each other
i moved closer to them so i could hear
in the local newspaper they had a chart that showed how many people ruined their eyesight over the years from computers
for example if something is thought to be offensive then it can be placed with others like it
the chief guest arrived on time
dolphins live in oceans
she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched
dear   computers are a big part of our society
we all helped the man to pull the little boy out of the swimming pool
there has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently
people get distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else
there was my main reasons why people should have a computer
there are some books that some people find so offensive that they can not even continue to read the rest of the book
to cheer up the reader he ended the story in this way
by shopping online you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product
though not in the same way many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life
the first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful
no parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up
there were people around
dear whom it  have you ever wondered what it be like to spend all your time in front of computers
finding new species is something you need to explore nature for animals fish plants there are many out there waiting to be discovered
pg i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
the setting affected the cyclist performance
there are snakes that are not poisonous
you can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it
those are my reasons why computers are good
she was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well
we have lots of great books
i believe peoples lives have been overcome by technology
the computer is often used for projects essays which is important
or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer
you had a computer you could have simply emailed your boss
the setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride
it is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such
and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term
all she have to do is try harder and she maybe will be able to pass his test 
this vary for it depends on age and the way the reader will understand the content of the books
his children also live a simple life
in this  the author explains what it is to have a family and what it is and means
the hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring were it can bloom and became big and beautiful
reason to this situation is that it takes time away from your family and friends
but instead they get too addicted to  and that they forget about their school work and their priorities and their grades start to slip
distracting games are a waste of time and cause stress
you just got to know how to avoid it
it is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same
you flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up
in my opinion i think that yes they do have a positive effect on people
some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge or become naive because of this lack of knowledge
also living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family
movies be different
the first was the terrain which started out flat then turned to hills
she encounters no buildings for a long time when she does encounter a building it is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape
if anyone violates the rules and is not in uniform or makes mischief he gets punished
a large number of students come from villages towns and cities and they stay in a hostel
so you can see there many negative effects on a user of a computer
dear newspaper people should use less time on the computer because it effects their lifestyle
so why not take the risk
if all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow
this shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir
in the field the player is not supposed to dispute the decion of the captain
there is no reason for a censor in a library
is keeping these things from our children lying to them
it is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant
it saysin the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
students would rather go on the computer
the features of the setting effected the cyclist
this is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do
censorship in has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art
computers have to technology to go online and chat with various people all around the world
then they can talk in time
its all about trying to become accustomed to changes
this shows that someone is hurt by what has happened amplifying the story
the internet also gives you the advantage to shop online
then again its just my opinion
magazines can also be found offensive to a lot of people
what is a library
these game can past time and the player some fun
my second opinion on computer is that
life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment
corrupt censorship occur when censorship decides to remove or block showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator
second you make friends
some believe that they help us learn but i just say so do books
you disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also became very addicting to some people but i think i am right
once the automatic doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section
you wont enjoy yourself and doctors
and i hope it sticks around for a long time
the cyclist was greatly affected by the features of the setting
books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need
if there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food
the setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town
reading is very popular
is this a bad thing
computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away
we just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring
dear local newspaper people throughout the world use or own computers
in this memoir the author creates a very nice mood
kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home
also should enjoy life
but really everything you would like to know is right there
to conclude i think that computers have lots of effects on people
but then they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read
just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor
do you think that if certain books music movies and magazines shout be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive
the mood is both grateful and happy
hubs for the public
blessed are those who have good neighbors
means that if everyone took out books that they felt were personally offensive then there would be no books
the different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all
but one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because there are a lot of people taking online classes
look back into our history we are a country full of rebels
there is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed
if someone wants to say something they should be able to say it
by using censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves
magazines are also a small portion of this conflict
after looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights
from things such as books music movies magazines etc
this shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting
so we would have our parents drop us off
children being able to do this
however the land had changed long ago after these men were last here
sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination
libraries are considered public places and have a wide range of audiences
the way computers make you feel is not enjoyable
the cyclist felt black humor despair and then relief due to the features of the setting
this quote describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds
taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings
the author is very grateful to his parents for all that they have sacrificed for him
next reason why computers are bad
libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them
his parents perseverance is the basis of his life today that taught him great lessons
they can set rules for their children saying they only see rated movies or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel
every one’s work is no one’s responsibility
we were asked to carry some food
two of us went to the police station
the scenery was getting more and more empty
it shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one after seeing the flower from her childhood memory
there are so many forms of chat on the internet   etc
that why i feel people are not spending too much time on the computer
some others said it was a bridge created by god to connect
throughout everything you do in a day chatting with friends is a good way to relax and have fun
i would rather live life than be on a computer
i said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things
yet i believe that it could have a negative influence as well
lastly you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot
maybe you do not understand if you have been assigned in a certain class
if you can read you can do anything  you could be the one to run to whole world one day if you read things right
that certainly does not benefit society
the censorship should be used only to help the kids
this showed that the family was still in the country they were in now but before was good too
the weather and terrain had worn him down
the text says
would we decide to take these books away now
while the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland
dear newspaper i strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive
so he ends up running out of water
besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly
lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying
eighth grade teacher
there are many reasons movies can be offensive
life would be very hard without them
my first major reason is it can and does help hand eye coordination every day
these days this is happening all the time
to conclusion i believe computers have a huge negative effect on people
the internet the very place where so much information passes through be it good or bad
he prepares his lessons
going back to research what about for solving crimes
it has changed the way we do almost everything today
the setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated which presents the main conflict of the story
of business meetings are held over the internet has benefited work ethics
for example the sun was beginning to beat down
it help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of
i believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to
ultimately astronomy the science of planets and stars was born
yes i know they are about thing that happen in history
one way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger you move the mouse and click
friends are a big part of my life and i love just to talk to them and see how they are doing
you can buy plan tickets
the air is fresh and free of dust and smoke
you have nothing except your laptop
this is why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test
what would be on the shelves
that is what can happen when buying something off of the 
they provide education for anyone who has access to the internet
lastly materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research
everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is
another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses other hills tumbleweeds crossed in path
now we can go on the computer to find weather the medication is at all dangerous
the most common categories where censorship is not all right in my world are books and music
this is where the offensiveness comes from
he was riding in
making friends online is the unsafe thing to do on a computer
have you ever been to a library
and that is the mood of the memoir
finally people go online to chat rooms to talk and met new people
people should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music
remembers his child hood fondly in his memoir about his home in new jersey
because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives
it would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world
to conclude computers help people talk online
if think the author did a very nice job
people can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence
there are some people who are on the computer all day
third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family
on the other hand she decided to live a better life and find dates over the computer and live a new life
failing hurt her greatly
it all depends on the persons own interests and choices
if we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of
people listen to music all the time
then you can look up another place online that has the same features but it be way closer then going to each year
magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for
not just the same thing everywhere i go
no one wants their identity stolen some up ad
the author gave the happiness to the cultures they have settled with the author giving them friendship and happiness
seeing all my aunts uncles and cousins it so much better and fun
it seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act such as music as the number one offensive material
loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him
the future is coming
emailing is used for many things
censoring a book is taking that persons ability to learn about and understand a certain topic that was censored
even at his first ghost town he just chuckled checked my water supply and moved on
every intelligent citizen would that computer have wrong information
books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new world for readers
especially growing kids and teens
is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship they have very little reason
the gives all citizens the freedom of the press
unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them children should not read them at all
they could choose to stay away from that sort of thing
these children act in ways that reflect what they have seen
this is a good thing because then no one will get and everyone will be happy
he is very intelligent
when i get home i check the homework and talk to my friends online
so if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon you can talk to them then
people on computers waste a huge amount of their timer
the flower represents determination using the flower to show her own determination
many places show and sell offensive material
for someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong everyone has their own opinions and rights
in the last paragraph is says this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
let us start with books
going outside and getting fresh air
nevertheless computers are dangerous
also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you
some say that the computers are good for the society
also what kids say in profiles
going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school
all you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information
he reaches the school before school starts
this is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story
in other words the things that offend one person not offend another person
this made him dehydrated
will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children this scenario is how it should be
according to a health magazine tests shows that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose your brain cells
this shows his happiness for his parents risking their lives for him to have a better life
i know they might not be the best reasons but they are quite important to me
computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world
he comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid
while on this wonderful adventure of learning you even get yourself into a vacation adventure
the mood displayed by the author was a warm cozy feeling that felt like home
many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising
these are or the many problems computers cause
in fact many employers hire you based on your keyboarding skills ones one is skilled enough they even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard
the song was by a band named 
another reason is going to the library cause you send more money to fill up your gas tanks
the card could have their name age grade and date of birth
the statement also concludes how you should never gave up
because of an increase in technology children and adults are not spending time with their families
in the we have the freedom of speech and press
has this changed your mind
some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work
i have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases
you could be improving your coordination and not even know it
in the library
this is way computers can be a bad thing
however homework is not the only school work effected by the computer
if you want to know more about different cultures such as 
so she becomes determined to pass the test
in a house with too many servants or masters there wiil be no order
but too much censorship can become a bad thing
finally they spend time with their friends and family
so is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault for not educating their children on the morality of such items
you could be out side learning hand eye coordination
another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories
the final benefit of a computer is the fact you can know about world news in a flash
we should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read
we are blessed to live in  where we have freedom of speech
nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such
she then kept cycling and saw nothing
i do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life
people need to enjoy the wonders of nature instead of sitting on a computer
yea they have their plus and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous
this shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life so will she
who wants to be told what they can and cannot read
the memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving
many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness
if it makes you uncomfortable put the book or article down
the amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere
they can be asked who they are were they live
humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology
so she has to accept that she is here home and i think she is on her way to doing that 
but to make matters worse he came to rolling hills
another way computers benefit society is by allowing us to get any form of entertainment easily
parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started minutes ago
my third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world
the bad effects are very serious and dangerous
dear  i believe that computers are a good source of technology
there are some cases that a victim of an accident recovers with the help of computers
the last reason why computers benefit our society is 
and i also hope you agree with me
censorship in libraries has gone on too long it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them
as it would only make sense to try to keep the peace
i can also remember going with my grandparents
they wear dirty and shabby clothes
libraries are found all over the 
it has grown extremely popular in chatting
by doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer
especially in the you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park
computers have been the technological item to have over the past or so years
school another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn
when you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip
example if you are bored you can get on computer  search a game you enjoy
therefore it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves
the same can be said for merry scenery too
most of the time people wont even have the book their looking either have to go out and buy get one from the library
eventually he had relief of the cold water helps to bring up his spirits  sense of humor
yes there are but using a computer is so much more faster
first of all there are many places in the world that not everyone can go to
if you say good for you
as grow up they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling
of people agree that the invention of computers helped our nations to be closer
the money the give to the government is to take care the homeless people
a world with a full education for our children to take advantage of and a place where we can stay with each other all the time
it was a very interesting show
the principal is very interested in sports and games
there are really three main reasons
young adults spend hours on websites like   and communicating with their friends
for whoever reads this remember what we produces as media is who we are what we do  and what we live for
yes books can give you tons of information but not as much as the thousands of websites there are out there right this minute
we get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that had found
the last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination
also books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about
we are too connected as a society
you could do that too
this quote talks about how the setting  degree weather dessert can him
the book titled  was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it
they need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to
the setting effects how fast hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal
one last thing local newspaper is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time
my pet is a cat
equally important using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs
so i along with some of my friends went to the okhla lake
a doctor’s profession is noble
then i came across the music
society today has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment
here in  we have the freedom of speech
if we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries what would we have left
they should have a different store for certain books
there was also a big crazy twist in his way
so think about the decision you are making and will benefit our society or make our society to its knees
they can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong
the mood that is created by the author is joy
i believe spending too much time on the computer is bad for everyone
my friend was on his computer typing a report and then his computer shut down
in the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist
i thought to my self that they want to hear that from me
they would start reading and soon read something that is completely offensive
children do not need to be around those kinds of books
do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer
people learn much of what they know from the computer
or will they take a turn for the worst
computers are the next best thing since sliced bread
in our community library in  we have magazines in which case these magazines are very graphic
computers allow now of communication between friends
there are much less people outside
it is a whole different word now and it is a lot of old books and songs
but i am true to myself
yellow journalism will never appeal to the baser instincts of people
i would say we keep it our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it
now is the time
for these reasons computers are good
by censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children
a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down
a young boy jumped into the house and took out the crying child
i came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier
the issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see
if there is foul play they penalize it
last you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone
as you can see offensive materials should not be in libraries
the features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town
we put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone
dear local newspaper opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people
if we start restricting that freedom what are we then
you can even get to play a book you are reading witch helps you learn new words that you not have knew how to sound out
more than of the population computers benefit society and have gotten people all over the world smarter and advanced
dear to this concern computers do a whole lot now of days
the second reason why i am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming
the computer can only show you nature but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand
and lastly the readers who can do all of the above and read
some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing
computers have flaws but they also have so positive effects too that i think they shine over all the tiny flaws
in libraries there are of course books
we can send registered letters parcels and money orders
many books would be gone
however it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions
she runs very fast and wins
another thing i like are sports
well i guess that about sums that up for me
they caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination as well
another example might be television shows like 
i think that after a certain age people should be aloud to read whatever they want
they help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words
meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another
what if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read
finally the internet helps because you can receive news through it
all right like i said first we will talk about what the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer
it shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do
this happened in the passage
it creates hatred against other people
than parents all you got to do is take those songs away
the plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test
call me crazy but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable
in the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private
the same thing applies in a store
should we as peopleas normal citizens really decide what others are able to read
i used the computer in the dark so now i need contacts
things get censored for a lot of reasons too
well i have
i feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid line
computers then come in handy
do you now see that nature can be helpful
where no one is able to get things out
do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended
no you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework
when a kid watches murder mysteries fantasy shows or dramas with bits of nudity it is different to them and they are curious
the author describes this scene as the wind was blowing harder tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds
also you could play online learning games for free or buy a with more options for learning
we should go out and enjoy nature but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as well
ten this essay old men give the cyclist direction and instead of using a map he takes their advice
my friends moms changed because she got a computer
that brings us in next issue
the cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all
movies in the library are for teachers to show students
i firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive
that is what i think was the mood of the memoir created by the author is
no one should have the right to take that away
they did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that
shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter
except for one thing that she quickly recognized
yes the library is mostly used for books and studying but there are many other things that libraries contain
should be removed for profanity and drugs
and then it talks about his gratefulness to truly show the contrast between sacrifice and the state of being grateful
it seemed very difficult as i kept falling
i am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
i think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing jobs and schoolwork
the author kind of gives you direction  idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds
libraries are fun to go to
i believe the correct answer is computers
the motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before
my conclusion is we need computers to survive without them we will be in the stone age still
have you ever walked down the street and saw someone the size of a boulder
i modeled after her likes and dislikes
my second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect
furthermore just from using a computer anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the 
if people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight
typing skills are needed by almost everyone in the world
in this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures
people also make and keep in touch with great friends through the 
you can have your own censorship in libraries from your individual freedom
so people can see what the author has to say
i think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness
i love it immensely
how your might you can bark those easy to find everything becomes all that are locate
or do you want them to know what they should and should not do
the games kids play could help them learn more
the computer is surely a great invention
i never thought playing on computers could be addicted
she is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home
because computers give you the ability to talk to friends family and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so
my brother is in and every day i get on the computer when i get home and video chat with him
the same goes with family
she and her nurses treated the wounded provided them with good food and recreation
well before long one became two two became four and it just kept going up
that way the material will no longer be public but rather your own and you can do with it whatever you choose
the parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying
the school can have a bad image from the students
then i went to the bookstall
if we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive we would not have religion or modern science
another reason why i think children should have the right to the computer is because of the information they learn and discover
and use the computer only when you need to
nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them
talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face
 do you want to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer
like all the trees flowers wild life animals too
the author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background
he reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope
a camel is a very useful animal
no late fees and no waiting lists
that is third reason why i think computers are good for people
taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them
censorship in movies is also growing
in my own perspective should be an adult section where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out
i honestly say some of these censored words
if the libraries do have books that are offensive they do a good job hiding them from me and other kids
these things are necessities to the world
another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
and when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to
remember computers are easy to use you can stay connected to friends and you can go to school on them
he handed it to me and i just lost it the book was not a children book at all
f was in sixth grade i needed glasses because i was addicted to computer for so long and my eyes got damaged
that just goes to show how much i use computers each day
by remembering these mistakes mankind will be able to move forward in literature
its easy to find entertainment and is extremely helpful and profitable
one of them is trees
without books people turned to electronics for entertainment
in conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction
than it keeps that mood going when he tells us about all the people that come over regularly for dinner
this question could be answered in two very different opinions
for example all the children magazines should go with the children books
so obviously computers are a great influence on society
they start to talk and become good friends
being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclists energy he needs for riding his bike
we need to get people off their butts and away from the computer
dear of the  computers are a wonderful tool and they bear many positive impacts on society first computers have created numerous forms of communication
libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge
most college students do their homework on the computer
many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their tasks
i have three cousins that live in that i never get to see but with computers i can talk to them all the time
the third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment
but whats you opinion
he thank them for teaching him so many things as a child and the environment he grew up in
so my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things
before you bring books off the shelves you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right
it would be great if some how the system could be improved and people need to be more responsible
not everyone believes that certain books are bad and i am one of those thousands of people
geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter
identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt
could anyone ever leave those who you care most about behind
it took me seven days to learn
she means that even though she misses her homeland so much she is slowly getting used to her new home and her new life
that is until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet
but until her flowers are gone she will not worry about school
having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not
even science has proved that trees are as necessary to our atmosphere as our food for life
this is my daily routine
i guess it all depends on your view of the situation
they see an older kid fighting and they want to try it out
only you know what is best for you
in this memoir by family is immensely important to him and that mood shows greatly
next the author installed a sense of warmth
do you have any better ideas
instead up being blinded by the screen you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike
if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated
the features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist
you would hardly ever get bored
then we came to the cages of birds
i love them all very much
the author created this mood by telling the reader how grateful she was to her parents for their love and sacrifice
books are a great blessing
computers effect families everyday lives by giving them online educations
everything from music on the radio to military files are censored
is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer
in this country we can
for example breaking in homes killing people and high sacking cars
he is happy is parents worked so hard to get him to new jersey
i asked them what do they think is this to happen
if it does people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed
dear local newspaper i also agree that computers have a positive effect on people
this also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it
just like how has a new song out
to keep the society from becoming offended or for that matter thinking
newspapers are found all over the world
never find fault or speak ill of them
most importantly they are a vital source of communication
of how things use to be before white and colored people were treated the same
while people are using the computer for random activities they are not having any physical activity
how can you never things do
i believe that computers do not benefit society
maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about
it also resembles hope because if the plant can make it through the winter and bloom in the spring so can she
but his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store
that my give you a virus
another example is when your bored you can always talk to someone on the computer and have fun with it
these two sentences give the reader feelings of safety and once again emphasize care
but that same book i have read might be interesting to other people
there are people who hate change
he tells of the hardship of the sacrifice they went through
so with that being said the changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over and he will get another chance
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
the end of this story combines the two different countries cultures and almost worlds her life is from
today people are sending pictures to and from each other via emails
this reminds me of the time when are of my idols died
 there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting
first spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways
the camel is a large animal
in the end computers are something we i need in are life because it makes life simpler
this is my opinion of the statement
 i can tell you reason why
every person has their own life story and rough experiences
so now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school
its also good for the kids too
fast food companies like contribute to obesity so do computers
thanks to a close friend
these hills made it hard to go up on a bike considering his lack of water and the heat
go to your computers right now  learn some things
what kind of library is that
even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands
all help make our lives a lot easier at times
the man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting
the author loves everything about this neighborhood
i came to the 
replied   the book is to reviling
computers are no help to this problem
all over the world young kids young adults and adults are reading books magazines listening to music and watching movies
what you not now however is that they supply a great amount of knowledge to the average person
radios have specific channels playing specific music
it in my opinion and experience corrupts both the mind and soul and causes man to be things he is not by nature
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit the setting effects the cyclist in the story
playing computer games and online poker sounds fun right
an extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online
this is were the internet comes into play
if they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh harsh thing
the temperature was very hot where was little shade the sun was beating down on him
sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor and then we  learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them
censoring we all know that language is the foundation of human legacy
also this will stop you from interacting with new friend and your old ones will find new ones
so if you want to get more of an education but you have to work too
one reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information
these are merely a few ways that the internet helps with schooling
you can use to find people you need to find
younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting
i remember one time when i first started going outside i had so much fun
this is understandable also
the world is revolving around electronics
you should talk to parents about getting their child an computer
it has helped one as a student
reading is an extremely popular activity
he clearly is very grateful for his family and had a happy childhood
every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life
the thoughts of the youth is completely swayed after they watch read or listen to this
for someone who is quickly running out of water this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue
a majority of people would say yes
after finding a place to get a drink he stated i had an overwhelming and buy some bait showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water
because there are billions of people on this earth and i doubt they would all give you the same answer
the reason the author was inspired was because of the flower
it was a very interesting match
she was crying in the store and just very depressed
his work is full of difficulties
computers are a lot easier to help us with school work than textbooks are
most of these books are not trying too promote these things but they are just part of the story
if that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands
with all these computers many social networking sites are born
but why do you ask
does that seem fair
we also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most
books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them
for instance their clothing
the features of the setting very much affect the cyclist
know what i think most of you have learned from this is how to keep your children same
it would really offend them
now in a library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs
but i still think that there are ways to use computers without the bad cause
clearly this is a great source to use
he runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people
well then i could get a franchise closed because it offends me
dear  technology has made great improvements in the past years
get up get active and go outside
my views on censorship is that yes our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them
we as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions
in all of these examples there could be bad language pictures and messages
in addition to students writing papers computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading attendance records and more
the latest gossip can be found in many magazines
to start computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination
the reason why i chose those things is because you can look those things up on
the setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one
libraries should be able to have a variety of different books
life would be much slower without a computer to speed things up
lastly computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends
he is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain
what society needs
he or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book
bad books spoil our minds
offensive books movie music and magazines should be cleared from the store
what does all of this go to show
you might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us
but with all this technology we still need to find a balance
movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with
censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality
in some books its has some offensive stuff about that were stated by 
luckily in our own era i do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries
they could do this in a variety of ways including making new friends and adjusting to the area
the features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist
another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes
taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment
that is what i think the mood created by the author was
some kids today though are very attentive to those subjects
dear editor i feel that we should not take any movies books and music off the self
there where a computer can help you
i do however agree with some censorship
also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them
he wears a smart khaki uniform
kids these day have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by staying on their computer and play their computer game
i eased past to
he describes how hard it is growing up in a racist time and how the real meaning of family is changed through different points of view
magazines are like books they are meant to be enjoyed
and they can look up whatever they like
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas
those are some the best reasons why a home computer is better than not one
i believe that computers have a great effect on people because you can keep in touch with family and friends go on school websites and use search engines
its the real world the adult world
however the majority of censorship does not take a good side
to not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational the computer is the future plain and simple
if the setting had been different such as not being in a hilly desert the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did
now i would like to the time to talk about is mentally when you go to learn
a lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all
can books music movies and other materials be perfect for everyone
how do you tell on someones maturity level
a few days after price siddartha’s queen mahamaya died
my hobby is gardening
i do not think those books should be on the shelves
while i found disturbing and uncomfortable others found interesting
you can interact with people all over the world
these websites are a great tool to keep in touch with family and friends or even fans
it made of steel
we all know that no family is like that
i believe the quote stated above is quite true
if they are offended they can go to read some where else
do we take it off the shelve and tell the sorry
so this brings to my final that computers are a bad influence on human and we should use less of them and for ourselves by doing not seeing
what is censorship
everyone has different taste we wont ever agree on anything
the items that do contain graphic content cursing etc
many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences
or read it
i would we need computer for many things for example we need computer for communications we also need them to educate yourself and others
most of the time that is correct about of the children take in the information and use it to help them
since a library is public lots of people go in to get books
technology provides great advancements in our world
fortunately it means we do projects reports and research on the computer
the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”
four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and out of those four people have had at least one account hacked
she loved her heritage which she still adore today
who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves
books are our best friends
ending the usage such technology as computers would surely be the first step to sending us back to such a barbaric time
do you want your kids like that
the memoir were changing all through the book
these are just a few of the things books are written about
as was previously stated once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves the library will be but a building without books
how about go on the computer
obesity is a huge problem in 
she was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed
the terrain was long and straight then turned into tall hills which had to be difficult to ride
he is a gentle horse and children love to ride him
it can be used for personal use such as for talking to friends
throughout the memoir the author constantly creates a comforting grateful and happy mood
libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could think of
little by little we can help people what they can do with out using an computer
let me explain
its plain to see they are already spending too much of their time online
he grows paddy to give rice to the people
even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned people would still complain until what they want happens
first you can buy games from a store and download them onto your computer
there is a reason why things are   and 
another car collided with this car
they cleared away the crowd
people spend way to much time on the computer
after she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change
a few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated 
he presents the cheerful mood by focusing all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood
if we took all of these books off the shelves there would be nothing left to read
if there is something on the shelf someone can find something offensive in it
well i think they should not be sitting on their damage their eyes
books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer
all of that set a very happy backdrop for the family
with a computer everyone can learn about people all over
they always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love
some books in the library are offensive to some people but should the books be removed from the shelves
we logged on to google on found our direction 
when she feels that an important part of her life is returning that she can become comfortable and focused
people believe differently so it would be hard to please them all
people are not going outside as much anymore
dear local newspaper
also there are some programs on the computer where they allow you to talk to other people
secondly students like to listen to music
i know you will agree with me when i say that having computers has put a powerful effect on people it gives people an easier time in life
what if that thing they see in a movie is murder
the mood is described as joyous giddy excited and elated
half of uses computer for jobs for money just like my family
in conclusion computers do benefit society
you can learn about nature cool websites even history
do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them
plus computers help people make money
she knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud
well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer
now these are the reasons why i think so
in games including of   etc
that can easily offend a person but those are brilliant pieces of work
since the computer of tree cutting has stopped
the cyclist felt relief later on due to the features
how would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you
if they do not like it then do not read it
i know that when i was younger i used to play math and science games on the computer to help me study for tests
a lot of the parents do not want there kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive
my last reason why computers have a benefits in society is because computers help to make better technology
first of all computers are a big help when it comes to a computer class at your school
i know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work
is content out that children should not see however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with
it hinders expression
this can lead them into getting obese
computers have dramatically changed lives forever
conversations over a chat system are fast and effective
if it is portraying a bad image then it should be removed from shelves
both these books are popular even today
even movies and music can be offensive to some people
you can send people or even chat someone
let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind
that line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage
computers benefit our society because they are like an electronic encyclopedia
so i believe that books are more reliable
people were rushing around with huge suitcases and bags
learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted
teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group
each person is responsible for their own actions
i got so bad to the point that i was suicidal
the place was full of small and pretty houses
i go for a morning walk regularly
he is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home
the distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library
normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free
computers especially help out college students
he says he remembers them and still loves them to this day
some reasons include the put down on races comments in the book how the author wrote it and who it was written towards
first we can talk to people in different countries
people benefit from computers by getting everything and anything done from them
last i think another theme of this excerpt was heart felt
in summation help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families
also can have videos online to show us how to exercise or use yoga
for some it just depends on your age your beliefs and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place
it does this because while playing games people watch the screen and click with their hands
do computers have a positive or negative effect on people
everyone has an opinion
and the main character who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity is a going to sweat a lots
some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions
bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice
school or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life
the temperature was so hot the cyclist said he felt dehydrated
but today literature has gone down a new course
you never know what topic pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature
books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education
in a library there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to anyone
of course a computer can be helpful
that road was replaced by a host rolling hills
also there were hills
i talk to family members
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready
think about it how do children have access to things like that
the fact that the area he was biking through and that he out of water put himself into serious danger
you cannot stop the terrible things from happening
that is what family is about
we can go the web and facilitate our life
people always say that the world is going to end
not one you would want to live in i suppose
without the computers people would be lost not knowing what to do
if the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them then do not check it out
no one world like a child who is bent on harming others
one is based in with training to be a hero
this memoir made me connect this family to mines how similar it is
so the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up
in conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist
you might think they have positive effect yes but they damage your body
i could not help but ask why he was taking such pains
children are the future nobody would want the future leaders to be known for the widespread obesity
also helps us keep in contact with others
they find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book
it helps people learn new things about different cultures

i just think it personal wrong to say those kind of things in movies
not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too
another problem is side effects
think about it next to you look at a copy of   by  is it really that offensive to you
they need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that war want happen again
on top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition so you had to watch for rocks in the road

the pavilions of delhi rajasthan karnataka and uttar pradesh were very attractive

but there so key in major aspects today the pros out weigh the cons
two more things affected the cyclist
because people think differently
for example you have to a project on 
so no need getting mad over it

my friends say computers are one the best technology because the internet can help a lot things like if you have research paper
then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about almost maybe even hotter
see they do have a positive effect
you get large phone bills just for a two minute long distance call
there is a lot of bad music

obesity is also a big issue
a lot of jobs today require you to use a computer for example working at a bank you use computers all day
i am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading
books are important to everyone whether they realize or not
students at schools elementary through college are able to connect with much more information than without computers
why are we now cautious of our children pick off the shelf
because the found the work offensive the generations after can never read the books burned during 
among all other ties friendship brings immense joy to our life
however it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study
and what about the  webcam where you can talk to the person face to face
the opinion of the public is created by the current time trends ethics and problems that are going on
the mood of the reading could be described as grateful
because that is getting away from what the over all message is about
have you ever sat at your computer so long your eyes watered
but then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience or even to a whole country
music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves
this all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions

the computer is a very important piece of technology
people are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement
the cyclists attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not

many things in the setting affect the cyclist
that is what the computer is for
computers also take time away from doing something productive like playing outside
at the first town the setting is shocking but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous
if you were an author would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone
if people know what type of material it is and still choose to view it then they get what they ask for
little kids books about kittens
computers are about the only way to find pictures information and make it neat
the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story adjusting to changed in life
strongly apply to this

i hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier allow students to do better in  and are a great learning tool
then people get pulled in
this is an essay by
there are other alternations you could make instead of using an computer
every library has tons of information on just about everything
next computers help us with our school work
this is why i think that the censorship can be good and bad
people make emails download music and several other things
the mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful
when being on computer for a long time people will forget how to interact with others
a lot of people these days are using
if the listener does not enjoy rap music then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music
it contradicts freedom of the press
i have that chance
computer supply so much more then just entertainment
 that last paragraph shows that she has emotion
the tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died
dear  people acknowledge the great advances that computers give us but they also put us at disadvantages
books can be helpful defending on when it was made
we know their were many hills because in the text it says
the heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst
these are the reasons i think internet is valuable in this day in age
with webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them
most importantly people should become aware of themselves or people they might know or might know knowing this putting into negative situations at them in harm
they might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up
computers have changed the world in a good way and they continue too
we can also talk to our friends online

i people spend too much time on the computer
she also explains her past with such detail and care
do computer hurt you fate a you exercise
later on his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary
most importantly if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate
books that some people like are found offensive by others
but that does not mean that i spend my whole life on it like others
eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people
also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes
certain materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person
that why i think they should be remove
for all the reasons i have stated i do not agree with removing anything off the shelves because something finds it to unacceptable if not offensive
although some materials be offensive they should not be removed from the libraries
we have learned many great things from the internet
in conclusion i think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public
throughout these next paragraphs i will be giving you all of my reasons on the things that computers help people do
machine designed to do a lot of difficult work for us
there all made by mankind but with a bit of technology
just cause there is some kind of material they find offensive does not mean that everyone does to
many types of books magazines music movies and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content
some movies have bad stuff in there
one life skill you can learn is how to type
in the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press
more importantly how many different races are there here in  or even all around the world
what would you say if i told you technology was pushing them away
they live by themselves
at my local library their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place
this quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water
his task is very difficult
people working in the medicine field use computers to keep track of all their patients
without computers life would be ten times harder for people in this world
i know i have
sight is most of the time your most important sense
it can be useful to both adults and children
he creates this by telling the about how his family took everybody in
rather than socializing and just spending time with family and friends computer addicts choose to sit on their butts talking and gaming away
we sure need computer to look up information these days
some of the best advertisements have won international acclaim
i hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family
with computers communication is becoming faster and faster
the reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now

if its a good day the cyclist will want to rid
the author is using the 
first of all people are on the computer way too much
the budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower
even see the data collected
in the end the adult section needs to stay in our libraries
however i believe that there are more positive effects than 
you think that there positive on people
they can bring people together
the setting of this place effects the cyclist very much
in addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate
thus advances in technology will give the ability to learn about far away places and people
this shows the author is grateful for his parents endurance to come to 
i was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was
i think having a computer is good because you can research stuff and you can meet people and chat with them
kids and teens would be so bored that they would the parents insane
also shows the man was very thirsty
this is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about
he was very thankful for their giving arms to anyone who needed them and for their warm attitudes and teachings of what family really defines
two the heat is making him thirsty and is running out of his water
the computers are children from a better education
so if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now
parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them
i can remember when i started typing my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them
computers create a relaxing entertainment opportunity
first computers help you with school work
maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense but not all readers would take it easily
could even change their lives
we bought tickets and then returned to the train
sometimes it is harder to ignore
one day in summer the clouds appeared in the sky
what kind of civilization was 
well a lot things are but this happens to online chatters
technology is defined as anything that helps enhance our way of living
that applies to everything that could contain offensive material
books give people another way to learn new things
these are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder
kids can up facts about other countries famous people and even types of pets
to start off with everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive and whats not
we should try to keep the friends we have
features of the setting really affect a cyclist
also is expressed throughout this memoir
lets say you had a party coming up but had nothing creative to cook for food
studies show that of the kids who use his or her computer for more than hours a day is obese
hes also running low on waterthe water bottles only contained  few tantalizing sips
it is important for readers and researches to connect and take in all the information they read
the author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end
computers help people of age first computers let you chat with friends and family
computers are nice to have but be careful not to whittle away all of your time on it
secondly computers make time enjoying nature
it usually varies
the internet has so much information
i think that this would be fair for everyone
book hotels and airliners they even allow us to interact with our friends
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water hills and deserts
how far is to far
people all have there own mind sit to away that they want to live or how they want there kids to live
we all know that it your out side when its hot you get hot too
evidently excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster even to adults so we need to stop it
i think computers have a very positive effect on people
finally the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication
individuals can show care for the disabled children by spending sometimes with them
the reason that i think computers people to learn about new
out of people said they like typing on the computer more then writing it on 
these things are why the mood of the memoir is loving and grateful
in the of  i was surprise to find out that projects homework and research can take up half of your time with your family
as you can see this is why i believe it is positive
in conclusion i think computers is a great invention
further more computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or any else that is entertaining
there is more to the process like the people bring or take it to or away from you
well i believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library
this all changed when my dad bought her a lime green laptop for her birthday
many people think that using computers is a bad thing but look at the facts
these relationships are described in detail
well they can talk and see each other while on video chat and it will feel like still here
there are many different genres of books music movies and magazines
children have to learn these things some time in their life and i think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life
whether that means faster internet better researching book or more websites a computer has it all
can come to a person in multiple ways
i use the computer to talk to them basically have
a college university took poll one time
what if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over
the following day he was allowed to work on the computer and got three pages notes
in conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead
computers are really helpful
there could be many ratings    and 
every other kid got a or above but since i was not use to writing it affected my grade
i love family but i interact with them
there are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book and let the child check the book or magazine out
this shows that it is good for a child to see such offensive things
he then to the negatives of a computer
once you see what you like on it or what you want you can change
this shows that it is hot because he is sweating
by your side even through your worst
yes we all the it in movies and music but we do not want it in our libraries
most importantly computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment
people of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines
dear local newspaper the question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society
more often than not they come to our help when we do not know what to do
did you know computers were first invented by to perform calculations that were very long
there are certain sections in the library
media is all about someones free expression and trying to share it with the world
all books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them
because those books and many others are very important to us
these computers also improve social skills
it has great nourishing value
she will take the test again and will not give up
this is how the computer can come in handy when you need 
first going to tell you some positives about computers
every day they are on the computer
to begin the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level
she will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test
there are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive
there are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it
the effect of the story strikes our thoughts so forcefully but nowhere the characters overplay their emotions
anyone can go their
i have gone on excursions to almost all nearby hill stations and health resorts
sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair
first of all computers are a benefit to society because they have the ability to and teach teach us what seems like infinite information
this mood is appreciation
he had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed
the point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works
this shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus
the used it in the colonies during the to keep the colonists loyal to the crown
one might think that is good but its slow with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly because of computers
that means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left
my mom always says that that is how she stays close to her friends and that is the same with me
google and is all you need
when your on the computer your not talking to people and becoming social and you could loose connections with you friend and your family
in addition to that there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer
it was once said  you can not know your present without knowing your future
how would you feel if tons of your personal info got out into the public
should not be removed if they are found offensive
everyone likes different things and some others not always agree with what they are going to be interested in
they also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all
school family and sports is my always tells me
it is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material but it is possible for us to prevent it
i you to consider my ideas
some people use the computer to make music
how do computers though help us with work
the library is open to any and or everybody
nowadays that is their way to communicate with their peer
therefore computers and other things are nice and all but are the worth getting fat or loosing touch with your loved ones
i know that for rated movies there is an age limit but for explicit books i do not think there is an age limit
and they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on
next you spend less time playing nature
i can give you good reasons why
how does that really help
in my opinion it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing
but sometimes people take advantage over it
our society could continue to greatly advance with the help computers
there are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites
but she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter
maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher
this is also a good way to get kids from reading things that not age appropriate to finding something that is
once the plant is thriving as such as her tropical home she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test
tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find
people steal so they can buy extra technology
communication was absolutely not as easy before having computers
dear i think that computer have bad effects on people
the reason why this story is caring is because they all the people stay there and they aid them until those people could move
computers make work easier and neater
in conclusion if there are books music movies or magazines that offend you simply do not check them out
do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons
the best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine
people do reports on celebrities and famous people from history
there were big swords shields daggers and other weapons with which the kings used to fight
all you have to do is type the place you want and boom there it is
you can even shop for houses or cars online
and you can talk online
our own words forced down our throats never allowed to come out
that is why i think the author included that paragraph
this means you should learn haw to type faster
obviously nothing is overwhelming
its the same thing with the other things like the magazines books and music
since technology has been a part of my life my two daughters have not visited their grand parents in over years
pets on the other hand need you
secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel
my grandfather gifted me this car last christmas
what is wrong to some people be right to others
in conclusion just do the right things and you will be healthier than ever
geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter
the mood of the author in this memoir was happy grateful and gratitude
dear local newspaper i just read about your article regarding the computer usage
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways
not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate which does happen to the cyclist in the essay
in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on
most young adult books have something to do with teens drugs violence and other things that would come off as offensive
by censoring records of history opinion observations our becomes an illusion
to begin with the learning ability people get from it has improved
how you know if the person on the computer is not looking for diet foods or fat free things
the library a wonderful place with many genres of literature such as children books nonfiction books fiction books adult books movies etc
because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior
children should read books that meet their age group
think off all the calories that build up without exercise
because it could mean so much
there are all kinds of books movies and even magazines out there
lastly you can see pictures of your family
the setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat
some books have material that might not belong in the hands of children
not only is the computer dad for your healthy
 computers are a problem to our health
people sometimes take it too seriously
a library should have a variety of books
students in high school to the after school with friends and get in to see rated movies parents
some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it
the most common computers are widely used by a majority of people but are computers really beneficial to society
censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems
which we all know we need to play sports
so many millions of children throughout the english speaking world must have read these books
the mood in this memoir is very happy and uplifting
by taking books out of libraries we are limiting our freedom of speech
you can learn about different countries people or even the recipe of apple pic
many jobs use computers
in the memoir the author has various moods
memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer
if you have kids you risk your relationship with them
many passengers came out of the compartment
rated movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games
if we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people
that is also why movies have ratings
they can learn from a new point of view
because you wake up looking at you everyday and love you everyday and take care of you everyday
this shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude which makes breathing more difficult
computers have become something that people depend on
we need to the of social without computer
not all of them are for the eyes of every person out there
the ticket came up to 
billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day fictional and nonfictional horror and comedy
another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together
not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically
this at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time
children all around the world find themselves wandering through the library every day
everybody has there different opinion and this is my opinion
it’s essential for small children
for students in any grade level and any class research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher
as you can see computers are extremely educational
you can find info about there future person they can look up there
aside from being a great source of communication computers are fantastic for searching and research
music is a very great art but when certain people abuse it it no longer has a good image
lastly i think books that are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently
they hypnotize the young children and adults
man can live a happy life only if he plants more trees
computers have made a big change to everyday life
its not like your going to stop your son from looking at a 
says to the new advancements in technology people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds
in  he says how his parents left everything they loved to give the author a better life in 
 that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries
music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are
he finally found a town with water but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men
the adult section has tons of different genres of books but what do you do when you find one about 
its never ending
it is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses
the cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him so he follows their suggestions
these types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries
i believe that is a from two to three cars
almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too
the doctors advise patients to take at least two glasses of milk every day
a friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling
but what are wasting money on
this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph
you to watch popular with today
books movies and music have been the main focus of the subject of this controversy
it is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material
furthermore people think that the computer is their everything
people including singer have been caught in sexting
entertainment can not always please everyone
dear newspaper i strongly agree that computers have effected people in a very positive way
you can actually hear their voice and know its them on the other line
maybe if you have to search something for school the computer can help you
the pitcher pitches the ball and wham
suddenly he noticed a passenger smoking
also most talkative skills will help kids today with there confidence
every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes
so there you can be on task and get ready early
firstly people are spending too much their time surfing the net
also on this short cut he almost runs out of water
another thing is sex in books
so whether you enjoy chilling and watching video playing games or reading up on the news you will always find a way to have fun online
i think a computer would always have a positive affect on people
libraries can have an affect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be
some are even unfit for young eyes
i feel that it would be unfair to remove books that some audiences would enjoy
getting fresh air can be good
i honestly never seen someone on the computer for
think of everything you done when you write a letter
earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem
computers are negatively impacting our society
computers can even help connect family members who live long distances from each other
this quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat but also with lack of water
they now have planes that can be flown by a man far away and this would save there lives even if it gets shot down
instead of over charging a phone bill many people keep in touch via email
the quote how the author thinks of the different cultures uniting together
the music we listen to can get really intense
lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night
dear editor have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important
about four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers
they can cause an addiction and create numerous distractions
the plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow
reading should not be restricted by any means
music is healthy to the mood of a person
the material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read
but could it be a bad thing
all you have to do is manage your time
one person can slowly make a difference person by person that is exactly what this family did
there is a small garden in front of my house
computers are amazing and society benefits from them by a lot
there are so many programs to use that making a big presentation could take minutes
and that concludes my opinion on how computers are helpful  lots of diverse ways
books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library
soon my temperature rose i felt hot and restless
this means they will be on them all the time and never do other things like go outside
but a public library is for the public
more and more people get computers everyday
there is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer
you can still believe what you want and read this book
so who are we supposed to believe
with computers you can create documents pictures and even movies that will stay on your computer forever
as a teenager i know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries
some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money
and it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off
i think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration
a concern i have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers
in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclists was effected by the features of the setting
but in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful
dear newspaper  i am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country
when i made a  i talking to people who go to my school
its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of some one
if those experts took our computers about what would happen
people use music to express feelings
moreover statistics show that of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day
out either have no backyard or have nothing better to do
but people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground
also computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world
a setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking drinking water and worrying that he is going to run out
all these words and many other words close in meaning set this mood
a special birthday cake was ordered for me
in this generation our species relies on cellphones websites with recent dates and the news
i think the area where the most offensive things are are movies
we reached the bank
the conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist
censorship for those who understand is unacceptable although select items should be viewed under supervision
i strongly believe that being on the computer to long is a very bad idea
loves and appreciates what her family did for her
i for one think that this is a terribly made thought
these things are a great solution to the rising lost of entertainment
how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads rolling hill and the
some books seem bad but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned
next it might let someone feel better
this made him dehydrated and miserable
dear  a world without computers
it is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place
the author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring she will take her driving test again for one main reason
everyone has their own likes and dislikes not two peoples are the same
any wrong turns which he took thanks to the direction he was given could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time
avoid cigarettes alcohol drugs and tobacco
dear  i am writing to tell you about the effects computers have on people
he is becoming desperate
they were accorded a warm welcome
read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic
instead of removing why not just move them to an  section of the library
people that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out
there are plenty of sports that could be done such as soccer baseball football and so many more
finally computers help us get work done easier
another example would be slavery
i disagree with the idea of censorship
this poor man’s vehicle can carry two persons easily
but if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them then you my friend have absolutely no standing on the situation
for example someone by accident stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials
its just sad
no because it used the words in a very nonviolent way
one is about a soldier in and his present wife back home
but a computer can also be used for learning
these wonderful books also share another characteristic they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world
those who have come to receive or see off their relatives leave for home
that is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph
this cyclist seemed to have bad wick
every book music or movie will be offensive to some other person and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read
computers really are a helpful fun and useful tool to society
what would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days such as slavery automobiles and etc
materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve
i believe that computers benefit society
that section is only for mature people of the ages or older
if there was not anymore books in the library children would not be able to learn or grow
you can also talk online with your friends or family the moved or lives far away around 
i took to this hobby when i went to see my uncle in his village
in a magazine i read one expect  said that leading to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes
besides communicating through letters or on the telephone the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication
clouds appeared in the sky
a teacher once told me that i would not ever achieve my career because i had piercings
also i do not care about any noises that go on in the library
with computers you are able to plan your life with output
people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
with no computers you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine
they can entertain you because there is games that you can play
that is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately
i remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used based language
if you want to listen to a song download it in seconds and listen to your
the parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading
it shows and tells how grateful he is
we are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine
great people have taught the value of austerity by living a simple life
you can talk to friends
what better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish
the heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water
on the world wide web you can meet some new people who not live in your state or country
computers have great positive effects for everyone
library is a good source for reading books listening to music or watching a movie
the railway station is the place where people wait for
inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids
is some people that think woman are just slaves that is dead wrong
the mood in this story was security and happiness
for example lets say you went on the computer for an hour that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit
the heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive
but really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter
sister loves nature she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery
in my opinion computers benefit society
this is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months in which the weather is rough
but all things are good in moderation
now days i spend up to on hour and a half on the computers
you must go out and enjoy nature
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
students are smarter than many people give them credit for
computers give you all that
last we wont be wasting gas on are cars because we are using computers
so setting can break a cyclist
which is more important to you family or computers
they can be against some peoples religion and way of life
nature provides us with fresh air through plants and trees
helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on
so this heat will eventually heat up the earth
another idea i have is if you see a younger kid by older people books movies etc
thank you for your time
dear  are you
as long as he thinks about his death there is only more death
in the beginning when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water the cyclist was absolutely fine
this realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope
it was such a scary experience that none of us could sleep that night
all and all this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers
one little law change in could cause great negative changes in the future
thank you for your time 
gets a offended by this
for example if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences censorship should hardly be considered a crime
therefor computers affect us greatly
not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments
we as take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a 
in the library in our little town splits up the variations of the reading materialsmusicand movies
you could just about anything in the picture search engine
did you know that of adults are overweight
first computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste tree
communication is pretty easy on a computer
clearly computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful
there are a lot more good than bad things
it help a little but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily
this is why you need to spend less time on the computer
censorship to a certain extent should not be in present in libraries
the second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play
the is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs
so people should not take away books moviesand music that are bad
anything about a family coming together is loving
to whom it concern to many people it is so much fun but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so much that they loved
you could also socialize with family and friends
this would eventually remove our freedom
and the reason why i feel like that is because i passion for computer
some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors
also children are protect from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices
whether it or  or whether its or all are a great way to communicate with people
do you have any computers in your house if so how many
with that in mind people will always see you on the computer and eventually get sick of you
when you complain about something might as well complain in a nice way because if you do then that person you are complaining to will be nice back
get away from the computer and bond
stopping all that creativity from our author is tough and cruel
i believe people have different views about things
materials should never be denied from the library
also the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful because the author tells of how his community was a family
i believe that censoring things such as books movies and music in a library is not a good idea
so you and a lot of others payed for this book and now you want to wast that money
i also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too
sitting on front of a screen can your health and also
so i think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into it each day
friends  family start to know who you are less because you can see emotion through a computer
no one was around because it was the desert
they help you write reports or reports in general for any subject
if you have messy handwriting then you can go and type it up lastly you can songs video and much more when you browse the web
by making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor
there are sites such as can or 
but people need to get out more
thaipongal is a harvesting festival
before the beginning of  the were starting to be discriminated against
nowadays people are spending less and less time exercising but instead sitting at home on the computer or slouched on the couch with a laptop
last but not least begin to slack on interesting with friends and family
it is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there
it is our moral duty to help all those who are needy and helpless
however since the price of computers decreased purchase have stimulating
children are curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different
they allow us to talk with people all over the world
seeing that elementary kids are not as mature as say an adult or a high school student their level of reading is not as advanced as ours
there is really no comparison
computers have caused problems where kids do not do any types of physical activity which deprives them of their daily needed exercise
when a person listens to music or reads a book that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be
sure maybe some people are addicted to the computer but others use it only when they need to
it is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone
he is employed as a fireman not to clear fires but to create them
think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites
one mood the author conveys very deeply is that of his love of his family
a good idea is to separate the books put the ones that seem offensive in the back
also there is a robot used that digs out mines which saves many lives
that is why i do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores
there are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read
then everyone will know the answer
as you can see many people would be better off without computers
also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant
also the author is saying that when the seasons change things change
it would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries
the postman collects these letters and sends them to their destination
that one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action
he was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time
thirdly they allow people to communicate so go ahead take it away but see what happens when you do
this problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue
computers have helped students and teachers
to learn about information that is happening in the world to talk to friends or family and to help with school work
everyone should pull the plug on their computers for good and never turn them back on
this shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is she will be happy
but that just be because that is the way they were raised causing them to think in that same respect
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
i helps you speak correctly and clear
on the other hand the computer is a nifty device and can be very handy at times like if your need perfect directions or need a question answered
rain is both a blessing and a curse
censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students
after all if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is some people not oppose slavery as strongly as they do
the snow melting the geese returning and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings
there are many educational websites on computers
computers open you up met new friends
they might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for
but then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight
his mind entered a state of sad and hopeless thoughts but he persevered and cycled on
what good does that do anyone
there is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone
so he starts pumping and sees black gunk
mr david has four childrentwo sons and two daughters
many students like fiction books which are true story but it might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student is feeling racist to him
children should be allowed to read books such as  the  and in order to get a taste of how much times have changed
at anytime about billion are on some sort of electronic device
her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home
you start to panic and lose control over yourself
the computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library
two the computer can help you communicate with your family too for instance
in fact you can get millions of great recipes
third some people go to the library for peace and quiet and the library is there only place
throw out you can live without 
 this shows that it was very happy and exciting in their kitchen
that way you get what you need done
mr kailash is my nextdoor neighbor
the features of the setting in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affected the cyclist
these problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library
at the age of 
if people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read then where is their freedom
magazines are a different subject
sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive
our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in and in we think is right or wrong
when it starts budding will take the test again
when your write a report you tend to go to the internet
but then again you could pay your bills on line
really that great the reason for it is because the books that are on the shelf is
that is why the story ends with that sentence
something that you take as offensive be something that inspires and encourages someone else
the features of the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affect the cyclist
in response i simply returned the book and chose another one
we should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about
i think it would be a crime against to censor things in libraries
those headaches over time can become even worst
there is this one thing about computers that remains constant
also maybe publish some too into the newspaper
then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home
thus an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work
what offends someone not offend someone else
lastly is energy
they leave their families back home and work hard for protecting the borders
thank you for taking you time to read this letter
the only way a child can be exposed to this if their parents are unattended and irresponsible
make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read
dear editor of the  i believe that computers are good ideas for our community
however those same appalling concepts have become accepted if not an uncommon habit
so if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site
i am a large fan of books over the two that took place
he was losing hydration from all the sweat and he was losing it quickly
i can go onto webcam to see who i am talking to or i can go onto another website to get an instant message
the simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone
say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games
a is thought of as a learning zone
the books should not be taken of the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents
i also think the computers are helpful by talking to friends or family
just  my computer got a virus i had to get fixed and that took for ever
in the end when he finds a place to rest he turns it all into a lesson hell surely abide by follow the map
do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you
the computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other
some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer
the heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke
if you have a favorite book movie or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion
one reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information
i feel that these things should be taken out of libraries if they are offensive to some people
i do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers
if we remove books that be offensive to one we are taking away that opportunity for others
it is important to know about the possible outcome and dangers before we say or do something
these are what you can use to talk to your friends at school
what about nature
there are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun short rolling hills and no water
the great lack exercise is causing health problems
and one final way i know he had a happy mood is that he said everyone was honest and hard working
the mood of the essay i think is a sort of dry summer day the sort of oh my gosh its really hot type thing
in this is how we could censor books in libraries
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
the says things about the older gentle man throughout the story
it was talking jokes about black people
it is because there are people who do like it and do not have a problem at all and like me is not bothered by it what so ever
when you can just open up a word document and type it up
our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch
but he is fair and loving
the variety of subjects in a library such as songs magazines and everything else in the library is huge
pretty soon kind as a human will become all together through the 
there are websites containing the geography languages and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn
in my opinion if someone has such a problem with a certain topic subject etc
the reason why i choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for there class and their research for whatever class they need it for
its as if when the plant is ready to start budding she will also be ready
there is no way of making everyone completely satisfied but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved
but that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people
the main thing that computers are great for is research
the hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice
at last they come home
these reasons are why i think computers are a big help in our society
paints a picture of a home filled with love
its easy to say that he literally roughed it having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva
she can not talk phone because so what do you do you
when you go to a library you think its going to be a place that is a good influence
now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way
with very little water
as my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses
do i think certain materials like books music movies and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries
that is not a mothers dream to go and do that
also we can learn about faraway places like or 
the same thing goes for friends
there is no way to see this but one thing you enjoy maybe be offensive to others
you can have conversations with all your friends and family
everything will be gone because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad
they have a right to create what makes them happy
things like that i think put a bad influence on younger teens
when people use too much computers their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as well
my main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book
therefore i believe that there should not be censored books in a library and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed
even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from web sites
take my word for it
to make matters worse the terrain changed from flat road to short rolling hills
in conclusion i think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interest and opinions
having computers will help raise a students grades and help them have a more successful life in the future
the mood that the created in the memoir is 
the only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves
people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time
well all these things and more can be solved by using the computer
also might not be useful
computers are a part everyday life and they can help with almost anything
when riding a bike it not seem to hard
my second reason is to have a job in the computer business
i feel that books music movies and magazines should not be removed from shelves
if people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it
music can also be on the good side too
dear  i feel as though computers have good effects on people
i think the worst is liking people sign about killing people and raping kids and all this and that
there were different kinds of birds
sure they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff
many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright
people spend hours on these websites talking to people and forget how to talk face to face
basically computers effect our lives so much in a good way that it would be chaos with out them
censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression
the more you hid it the more children will seek it out
i believe had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation
we need pictures information and it must be neat
i feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers
but just remember your grades cars and your weight
the movies and music i think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it
for example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water
it should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out
having books music movies or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion a ridiculous notion
so should they be removed
so the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance
i never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away i was surprised
if censorship was practiced everywhere there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out due to a large amount of people complaining
that they now go on the computer
computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school
over time libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports researching renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read
i think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else
the plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant
just recently i read the book 
for example the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels
computers makes peoples lives just so much simpler
trees are valuable natural resource
if i had to say what mood this author created i would say happiness
the other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country and were cursing at her
using a computer will help us in life by talking or making friends on line
just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff
many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete
the is affected in many ways
i think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home
the people that use computers have important jobs
they are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it
i believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what offend others
they can see the different types of drugs and learn about them
dear  i understand that there has been somethings going on with computers
the road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills
not only do computers let you talk to people far away but people close too
that is completely understandable
i was spending around hours online and getting on sleep
how this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them then video chat
dividing those specific materials into their own section and regulating who check them out is really the best way to go
i believe books should be censored by content much like movies
to censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world
in had a front page spread to promote the use of computers instead of books
for example  a famous rapper
certain people find things offensive and others think it is perfectly fine to have in a library
i usually play for a couple hours
something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
for instance i have a grandma that lives in 
another student  is working on the same essay
what would you say if your library was censored
we used to have about 
as you can see there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important
he plays a very important role
i think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read
the snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like diamond back
what can you do about this problem
so please stop using the computer all the time
i feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to
but are all the libraries meeting their requirements
criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art
children are taking time out of their homework to go on the computer citizens are gaining weight and children are being kidnapped
in the setting the young man is faced by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person
we have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not
finds out a new website there going to tell there friends and there going to pass it on and on
he is very tall
i hope you agree on my topic
in conclusion i think that computers have a positive effect on society
i have known who have been censored all there life and when they learn about all they cant even handle 
lets say i was going to make pizza and i did not know how i would have to look on the computer how to
was very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice
could use the computers for 
there was a priest present and everything
i have family members in 
my first reason why i think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet you know what people say you learn something new everyday
of you eating an not exercising because your worried about the computer
you need to be healthy and most of all active
the in this memoir is joy and happiness
many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries
what would we do without computer
what has ever happened to freedom of speech
he waters them
talk to your relatives from and you can shopping without the waiting in line
if you live in a city with not a lot of nature in it you can see what its like outside it with the computer
the mood the author sets is very loving
foreign communication specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations in the fields of both business and government
in conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems
gives the ability to learn about far away places and countries
read more to find out how the internet is good for society
after a couple more miles he comes to small fork with a pump
this reminds me of a time when my brother went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing
dad said the reason she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago
nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new
i agree with these experts too
i feel censorship is a waste of time for the government
my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer
turn off the television if the program bothers you
if you have family near you then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another
for example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place
the only way to cook would be with fire
her mother stared at her incredulously
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
all because we are addicted to using the computers
their brain tells them to do things that are illegal
last but not least computers people are world in communicate with each other
the mood that the author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had
computers take away from friends and family time
these libraries would be loosing business to the people who maybe like the kind of stuff that they not
when i overheard a little of their conversation i could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary
to prevent these issues i say we put a limit on our use of technology
i was in the library looking for a book
if it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it
everyone has different opinions and likes
he started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation
my opinion on this matter is that agree that computer are bad and people are spending
my mother goes twice a week to the market to buy various things
some people think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite
you should always keep in touch with friends
people use computers everyday
so you cannot be online chatting or playing a game or checking your email outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors
offensive material will be out in the world
these are all things people enjoy doing on a computer
overall computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind
the censorship in libraries needs to be more strict
computer link the world together and greatly advance communication positively
it also makes a great teacher of about any subject as well
so read my reasons and by the end i hope i made my point
i am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries
they give him a sense of comfort
the second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home
dear local newspaper out of students at say that they spend most of their time on the computer
this causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a short hit leading to no where
also people people have the right to choose what they want
some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers
i am waiting for the little young ones to come
they have a great significance for students
 i would have to say to chat with friends
and every made in this world has internet capabilities
the child learn something new from the book
but the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience
then it started to get a lot more sonny
hes riding on hills which makes it even harder
where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be or placed into circulation
need an idea of where to go
computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away form them
the main mood he created was thankfulness
the family invites many people over to their home to have dinner
a person who is doing sports generally developed special qualities such as patience courage and senesce of responsibility
our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the  and now we have a that protects all our information
if a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material
this makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat
music on the other hand could be thought of as different
music is one thing that can bring everybody together
if you have a bumpy ride then the cyclist will have a harder time
it makes the reader think of their family and their culture and what and who they grow up with
i try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and i have good relationships with them
a real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired
we must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer
so throughout the whole story the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt but by also giving him hope
if people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display they should not even pick it up to begin with
those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist
just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers their ability to display the most current information
to begin with computers can be a issue for people
people spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family
a is that everyone wants to share their event with the family
i once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library
we could use a rating just like movies do
first of all people are to busy on their computers that they spend less time
in paragraph two the author talks about the simple house that his parents made a home
should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries
it read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate
this is called censorship
i feel that books should stay on the shelf however
genre comes in all kind of different types
another person might read it and like it
they could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep
because of the computer hard task can be done with a simple click of the mouse
some students make the best use of this period
it was useful and did not waste my time
instead of worrying thoughts you or not remember you now have confidence that you can look back and find your thoughts right on your 
so more and more people buy computers each year
start up your computer and get talking
there are other types of fruit trees as well
a little later he comes across fish camp he is very relieved and thankful to the owners
but just like everything computers have their downside
even kids who go to school need to use the internet of the computer for something like a project or homework
i think the effects will be severe detaching reality creating false personas and offering no physical gain
society was different then
so you might as well make good use with it
my friends the answer is nothing
also they help kids learn if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything then how far are they going to get in life
that dose not mean though it should be taken away
if you ever need to set information that not have to through the of bookthen a computer is the thing for you
on page he says i could drop from heatstroke meaning hes starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen
the lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert riding his bike all alone
i was caught
they started this home with three children in their small house
libraries are very educational
even if you buy the you are still learning by taking care of them
computers have far more positive than negative effects
these websites can get a person to be willing to be on computer instead of exercising and staying healthy
the rule should apply for magazines music and movies
every body loves taking with their friends and family and this is made easier by using computers
however much some dislike the thought of this much freedom we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some
in this story the setting affects the characters dramatically
there is a banana plant also in my garden
the author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future
some victims are enough speak up but sadly most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet
for example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park
they would probably act friendly to get the kid comfortable then they would end up kidnapping them
this is why i think computers are very positive
i think computers help a lot in life
to some people it be offensive but that does not mean they have to read it
people just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable
what could have taken months by letters in the mail took as little as one hour to do over the 
people use my husk for making
at first people would think it was a terrible world
this is yet another reason how computers can benefit us
he took a shortcut but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated
they should be read the way that the author intended for to be read
if someone wanted to rent a book and it was not appropriate for them to read then the librarian or teacher would restrict that book from them
this was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book
people can think what they want to think about offensive material
another one is that because there was nothing around him he felt frustrated
overall think computers have a positive effect on people
the next big topic is 
the libraries also would not have to worry about people being offended
these must be apprehended and taught some craft and made to work
some music be offensive to other people but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library
the cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening
the parents come to the country with such courage without any knowledge of the language or the culture leaving all there families and friends behind
this would help the public
this tells us everyone in the neighborhood is nice
without the computer families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button
it is obvious that more  more people are having problems with eyes everyday
i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive most people are willing to buy
they would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time
yes if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds
the setting and its features affect the cyclist greatly
teenagers are teenagers they must have technology
when you do a story for the newspaper does it come out hand written
i like reading about anything and everything so i would love to read things and spark my attention
because you want to get back to the computer
people that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse
the mood creates is that where you find the good in a life where there might not be too much good
but we both gained something by reading the book
the reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive
the author enjoyed a nice childhood filled with friends and family all enjoying the wonders of their home
on a game a user talk to friends while a game such as a   for example online game
it is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else
students keep their essays study guides and home work updates on files in the 
another one is about special needs movie or book that have to deal with people putting down others that have special problems
computers a very much talked about subject
last that is why in this lifetime you need computers
their happy because their all a family living together as one
do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of   sticks on their covers
i told you how a library should work
nature is a beautiful thing
we found that we both have accounts and keep in touch there
using the computer can access quick information
now that you know that lets move on to my first reason
instead we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline
i wanted to be brave and be strong
i also know first hand the rewards of being clean from this harmful drug per say
the bright lights of the screen make your eyes unclear state say more people lose eyesight from looking of a computer than they would by staring at a light
as you can tell the tool of on the computer can benefit your school grades
this is what i think should happen if they have books that they think is too offensive to people
hope you get something out of what i wrote
even though i disagree with his ideas i do not think his work should have been rejected
i have not found a movie or book in any library yet that i have found offensive
there is no such thing as a perfect world i believe if there was people would go crazy
you can find anything about anybody or anything on a computer that has internet on it
he said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice
in some of the reading material one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it
this is my first benefit of a computer
another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused
the snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly
no one is making you watch or read any of that
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
i think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood
its always nice to smell the nice air after being in school all day
you can get help in school work also
computers have software were you can instant message send emails or even video chat with that person
so again i say no to computers
i have written in response to the letter sent to me on the topic of electronics
also i think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again
she became familiar with her surroundings
i hope you agree with me when i say computers are bad
although some people think computers take up too much of our time and that it prevents society from interacting with friends and family
just because the student chooses this topic does not mean that he or she supports it
knowing this how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons
but they are not good enough for people
what would that person do
the extreme heat of the summer definitely put a strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water 
or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend
the computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of
i do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express their self through art literature and even music
there is no way to censor the universal language that music provides
it also allowed to see how full and good his was to
sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good
i think the top level or a certain area should be the adult area
so she then gets hope from it
i felt it was a waist of money but when saw her light delights for i it with love as well
books that suggest radical ideas could also belong in the group of books being taken off the shelf
if the contents of the book movie magazine and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored
i say this because instead of going outside
so how would that work out in the long run
also with you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing
i like spring season most
magazines are often picked up when going into the check out line in a grocery store
many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate
people these days are taking things way to far with their opinions
last but not least most people don eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer
it is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials
the family happiness
please understand the meaning how terrible computers are
should not be totally removed from a public library
i know the other day i saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim
before computers world spend hours in books and find what there looking for
a important ability that computers have is they are able to teach you about far away places depending on were you live
in conclusion in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race gender or religion
if you want to chat with your friend go to a place out
join a team instead of playing on the computer and 
but a mere ten years later the changed so now their are squirrels
finally i think people should have to give up reading listening to watching or looking at things that be interesting to them
while we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise
who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie
i hope that i convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people
for my conclusion all these reasons are true and computers are the greatest sources on the planet everyone do you want education or not
i have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers
he said i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
i think computers are great effects on people they help out a lot
you can change anything you want with just a click on your mouse
our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech
if we were to take away every thing that someone in the world finds offensive there would be nothing left
parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors they been through everything you doing or trying to do now
thank you for taking your time and reading i really appreciate it
those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer
i hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people
the reason why it is so popular paper want to talk to friends that they enjoy talking too
everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want
you can also look at diet plans find medicine for your health or find new ways to exercise your body
computers let you talk to family and friends around the world
there are always going to be those people who disagree with things
my third and final reason about addiction
technology has changed our world
i had to argue and prove a point in why i should have  on my 
in studies in  out of who spend their time  or more hours are wearing glasses
i study in cambridge school which is one of the best schools in london
the computer only benefits you in a way
all libraries check out books so the book is under a name
my experience with computers is that they have much information but sometimes it can be too much
i want to learn knowledge about myself and where i come from
while he is doing this he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same
so leave everything on the shelves
so then he runs into the bathroom  drinks from the sink
effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all
my opinion is that they give you a very positive effect
little kids about the age of six would be playing rated games and watching rated movies
it could be snowing and cold raining and of course wet hot and dry breezy and humid
everyone is going to be offended some point in their life
her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
certainly text sources can give the same accurate information but the computer is fast and easy
to sum up computers have a positive effect on people
it is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way
therefore some people hunt them to get their feathers
they contain many different styles and genres of books
so that would make then miss out on going to the library for books
hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable
i think most people can control themselves though i believe that computers are very important and also have a positive effect on people
in past experiences i have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting
in addition computers can help people get neat and clean
i loved to listen to music from artists like       and so on
the cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty
people in the can play games and chat with people in   and even 
if we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost
because he listened to their directions he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration
dear local newspaper  i am against that computers benefit society in anyway
if the book or movie is found offensive to you pick another but it should not be removed from the shelf
computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them
another thing is i am sure you have heard of a website called study island
they are useful ways to make life easier
millions of people died for saying the wrong stuff
this would be an exciting event for them this why they need computer
there is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law
computers have had a negative impact on society
i love pigeons
on the computer you can read the whole newspaper and even find out more about things that happen in our world
these ideas in magazines books in movies and even in music has changed the world upside down
at the of the day i think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public
most of use portables which goes back to my last paragraph
the next year she made captain because she was out training everyday before the big day
also the little kids has to small of ear to hear and also to small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that
the mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir
no one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves
you will finally be able to look up a place you want to go
the person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material
you are begging to become overweight
if books are removed from the shelves due to censorship than what is the point of writing or even reading books
if we made the change the age limited on movie we might be even better off 
all minor adjustments and easy to make
his mood was also very appreciative
also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes
when i read watch or listen to something i do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else
games be fun but they teach us skills too
a personal experience i have was one day friend and i were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report
in conclusion the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally
a perfect example is my brother
others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy
if someone reads something and it offends them they can go do something else
he should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own
other wise they parents are having their job done for them
set it up for only your friends to see
experts also say that is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier
it is wrong to make fun of or joke about people
books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future
the geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again
discoveries cannot be made about new species on the computer a computer cant find for your find 
she goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children
it is a chance to let go
personally i do not much use public libraries but i often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book
the reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from in 
the next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and does
but since children go in there and can have access to anything in there they can end up finding something that can be offensive
they girls end up being underweight sick and maybe do drugs
if everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books because something would offend someone
dear newspaper i have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society
but these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends
the wife was very close to because spent the computer helping  there can was always in the on the computers
during lunch and dinner we have cereals in the form of rice wheat and whole grains
or even bad
say if there is a book discriminating a race than i agree that it should be taken off the shelves
even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial
on a rainy day students will spend time on their computers
i remember when my friend would go home change eat and log right inside the computer
this lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy
kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt
i once has to drive hours to see my grandma in 
everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things
finally we are able to talk online with people that just be across town or across the ocean
some people find that offensive and some not
then it showed me a picture of  and the history of the country
i spend quite a bit time on the computer yet i am still a very active person
the setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water
this is why i do not believe that censorship in libraries is not a great idea
that way they wont lose each other
they are also known to have a very good memory
she let herself by the flower and remember her home
the hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her but at the same time s very comforting
they will find out anyways sooner or later
finally it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about
new music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library
most magazines music books and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you think
thanks to the computer we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed
computer games online can be fun but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill and purposed of you child
with the facts i have stated they have supported my reasons
as you see many people that have computers use it in a productive way
would you get offended
wide rings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke
republic day and independence day function at national and regional levels are also shown on television
he states tumble weeds crossed my path
the censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic
ultimately consumes all free time
many people base their actions on their own views
also some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society
if i was to send a message to some of my friends in through it would take seconds
i know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all
the mood the created was a mood of happiness and gratitude
i think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because hes trying to prove his point
the mature content in movies books and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them
it allows us to type essays and projects
many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger
when girls look at a model in a magazine they try and be just like the model
it helps us to improve our mind
so please change your mind
the teacher’s table stands on a platform
he does his duty honestly
the landscape changes with the state of water
obviously the library allowed it there for some reason
there are infinite numbers of information in the world and computers help find it
for me i am i want to learn more about my own culture no matter of how bad it is
our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons
censorship is a two sided question
there should be a huge meeting
the shops are mostly small in size
she will view this magazine as inappropriate
for this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner
after that they can not tell you to get off of it unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate
if you run out of energy while cycling you have nothing
moreover computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world
as he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere
we should all respect authors and what they put into their books
well i think the opposite of that opinion
you can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience
there will always be many more books there to look at
everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people
there are plenty of important activities such as spending time with family enjoying nature and school work and jobs
you can meet new people from all around the world
another mood is that he is grateful
if you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it
remember it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so
instead of sitting on a computer all day they can do something a lot more productive such as taking a walk starting a club adult once children
from what i see and understand i that computers have a positive effect on our lives
i think that computers do benefit us
that was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir
this will be her goal for the winter till spring comes
the heat also made the abandoned juice factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist
if everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf there might not be anything left to read or listen to
i am writing this article about using the computer more than an hour
the banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge
a library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place
did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone
many families have spent thousands thousands of dollars on buying the computers and them fixed
lastly censorship is a communist trend
next the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly
second reason that it teach hand eye coordination
having to pay to travel
the for example
whichever way you look at it censorship is censorship and censorship is wrong
people say that the best thing you could ever have is a supportive family and a group of good friends
many people are too focused on the internet and they lack on their normal activities
which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water
outside the airport there were cars and taxis
there is another way of cheating copying others work essays or articles form a website
in science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done
they had open dinner where friends and family members came
i think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness which is way the author concluded the story the way they did
this is sad
of course they should
the setting and the features affected him not only physically but mentally as well
the only way to travel in a desert is to ride a camel
which can cause people to loose time and friends
the titles of the books are displayed on boards
what is your opinion
everyone has different views also
you chose it 
people think the invention of computer and the internet is a terrify thing but truly is terrible time consumer
now you have to call a repair man who will charge you even more money
the memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting
he has four sons and three daughters
since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people
people hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said
one way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water
none people would be inside on the computer
that are going on the 
kids like me that normally have a long rough day at school like to come home and rest with some nice game on the computer
another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also
the author is always saying about miles or twenty miles up the road
above all the author clearly shows his love for his parents
but i also learned to be responsible with it
with this you can play many fun while learning about interesting facts about science
i say that because the people who are mostly on the computers only know about things when it is on the computer
most of the jobs in the world have one part that has to do with computers
also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that
dear newspaper you turn there is technology
while she stares at the hibiscus then the geese flying in the air she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test
kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like or grade
what there reading should have any effect on others unless they are reading also
teens got to talk to each other make new friends and post what they want
computers are very beneficial to society
you want my opinion on the effects computers have on people
most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read so they would not even look at them
native plants of her home
leisure can restore our energy comfort us and make us strong to work again
censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well
i feel this way being lack of social skills no exercise and addicting
the fun uses that the computer provides are    etc
another mood is relieve
realizes that they came to this country to give their children better lives
the a very detailed book and has many great facts in it but many people find it offensive because it says had a wife and had children
they left their family and friends to give their son a better life
you would become over weight and unhappy
also gives the change to talk to people with webcams
there would be nothing left
should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is
this book was exposing and very detailed in which i strongly disagree with other children reading this book
that is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way
computers even have webcams for video chat
the offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine listen to that music or watch that movie
i think not
you can talk with friends listen to music play games or do all three at the same time
why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school
if the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike especially if he is not a professional rider
a library is a sanctuary for people to go read their favorite books for free containing books from all types of genres
your learning about others cultures heritage family history and so forth and so on
the languages in movies and music are not what we think they are
for personal use computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects
dear  i am writing to you because of the concern of people that have computers
no one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot day while emailing a friend
in my own opinion i think that people should get less time on computers more time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
of people including teachers agree with this
my people do not spend much time with family and friends
another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information
so you can never trust a computer
why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your 
most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers but i bet a great deal of it is
and in any case you have to know what to do for example
all work is noble
true people do protest laws and with good reason
like if it is really hot or cold is it a good experience for kids anything you want the computer has it
we entered our compartment
she came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain
without this we would have no communication with him
stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes
last she burst into tears again
we went inside it was a giant library
having a computer you could do a lot of homework
that is why computers are so helpful and people just love them
dear newspaper computers have advance a lot since they were first made
that means i can still interact with family and friends
items are all over society
first they help people learn by looking up information on different places
but what effect does this have on people
even when chatting with friends online the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet
the mood is basically is being happy with what you have
he makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live
it really puts a bad influence on everyone
it is simply a place to inform and if someone is offended by what they see they should stay away from the library
censorship in libraries is a big argument today
they could easily go to play and talk with family and friends if they wanted to
this creates areas of gray where there is no right answer
no one is going to have the same interest all the time
there are fore my parents love him very much
it could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow
obesity in is at an all time high
for example the textbooks that we use in social studies at our school still refers to as the 
if you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have
the authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents
but if we get rid of all the censorship then it denies people knowledge
he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home
in doing this you for the most part prevent the children from entering an area that is not age appropriate
the computer also teaches you how to do different stuff
now from ages years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information
when a high percentage of people join that cause then it should be banned
i would have to agree with the second group of people
they act as an information highway and connect people together
those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive
nonot in my opinion and i hope not in yours either
certain material such at rated movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable
it is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live
censorship be good for some and bad for others
the author did it to symbolize things
the story ends with the paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus has taught her something about overcoming obstacles
i will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works
this is not a very good addiction to get into
it is where the author is trying to show to the reader
especially he is grateful for how his parents turned his simple house into a home
it gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again
it was here in the united states that he really understood what family was or what a home was
as the author of the story goes on her bike trip the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming
exercising gives you energy and is good for you
on the computer one can go to a search sight and type in my place in the whole world
anyone can check out a book at the library
if there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material
the school was full of boys and girls
no single person is forced to read a book they are offended by
so we say a stitch in time saves us from having none stitches later on
three main reasons are that people learn more about cultures places and some people work online
children and adults have very different views on what to read
some they know in real life or some they met online
this affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost
after school kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing
people or not agree with this but everyone is entitled to their own opinion
i think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves
libraries also have some offensive items in them
that is how the different settings effected the cyclist
i am asking for your help to do so
traveling according to sir francis bacon the famous essayist is education
some jobs require people using or  computers are a necessity to get a well  paying job
the author is happy remembering memories which are not unhappy or unpleasant
or how small they are still small
you can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day
in some countries the donkeys are used to
this is where computers come in
his hope was dwindling because of this
dear of the has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not
people who love horror movies probably hate comedies
he had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory
they see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is 
its practically the same as using a disguise
even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it and try to pass again
i love my books
with the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind
to conclude the author creates a loving mood
movies should stay in a movie store of at the movie theater
people having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people
another one is the built of the road
you can learn so much about him like where he was born how family relatives did he have and more
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
the land went from straight to hilly
these apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention
you stop using computers you deny yourself this magnificent way communicating
children are learning things they should not know about until an older age at a very young age
books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library
parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship
then you get a new phone number and forget other people number
i believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine or even watch a movie if they find it offensive
the first skill we could learn is typing
thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression
dear  have come very far with technology
it is not good to sit on the computer
but i think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both her old and new life
he had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of energy
these things offend people every day
it will warn people that the book contain material that offend the reader of the book
the senior students provide help to the junior students in the hostel
now people can simply type up an email and hit send
you cant always censor that
the earth is the only gifted planet which has a life
most children from ages to draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers
i think that censorship in our libraries would be a idea and i think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries
my friend when he was little would play outside for hours and hours at a time
let people make there own decisions
whether that be to exercise or simply enjoy nature
i think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere
she reached for the book intrigued and flipped through the pages
maybe even invite them our to talk face to face
a book that needs to be censored should not be in an school
for example if you are doing a project for school
this is the reason why i picked those two mood in the memoir
censorship in libraries i believe that there should be censorship in libraries
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
when i was young i would always want to be read to and when i continued to age i would always read
fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author
today computers are helping the world in many ways
he was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving
then on he wised up and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling
the computer hold lots of information but does it always hold the right information
some peoples might be talk to their family members
lastly the buildings were what made him want to give up
he does not indulge in antisocial activities he is against smuggling corruption hoarding and blackmarketing
many people before us went through everyday life without them
yes like the writer said the world is a fluid place
and reuniting friends you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button
the solo cyclist says there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
there he works for the whole day
this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  say before the last world war
i can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy and i noticed not one negative thing was said during the story
just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone
the one advance that has stood out above the rest is the invention of the computer
dear editor i hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good
how does this miracle happen between two strangers and bind them in the knot of love
two years ago there was a boy named 
he picked out spoke on horizon and rode to them makes his way across the desert
its a great way to get fit rather than typing and clicking away at your 
well at the easy access of internet on a computer you can buy all those items and more
the possibilities are endless
now you think we should do about computers
they are situated throughout the library for children adults and teens
you ask the amount time spend on computers is much more damaging than this
this showed how welcoming people they loved was important
in the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself
maxim has the  a bunch of laying around in clothes that barely cover them
first and for most is the fact that this is 
well if you are i believe that should not be in front of that computer all day
ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is
the author has left her home and moved to another country
being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become
if there is a book that you find offensive in a public library i do not think it should be removed
readers want a variety of books music and movies to choose from
on one side sat the musicians with shehnai and its accompaniments
he is also a builder
the sun is shining the birds are chirping and a lazy breeze is flowing through the trees
computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family
alert
many things are offensive but then again much of life offensive
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist
for teenagers keep it educational but be more relaxed about it
yes i know there has been rumors about people threatening over chats
however it should be categorized so a person could have an idea of what age group it would be most appropriate for
this would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing
i believe that computers are doing us more good than their harm
she also disliked her new home
some classics are also being speculated against
they are the true protectors of the nation and our lives
this allows for guide and efficient research
this book was a success story and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through
therefore i believe ho end winter hibiscus to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles
we need computers in life to help us do jobs communicate with family or friends traveling the world and for research on homework
yes books and movies should be censored
computers have many positive effects that are very important
also can always help you on something that you need help on and you can do different kinds of activities
i look at a computer and think of progress
part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change
teens want to be able to read about they can relate to but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe
one time i played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds
it happen to have the answer to his question
because of the internet there is basically no more boredom
she misses everything about her old home from her grandmother to the old plants there
some argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable i beg to differ
they will be able to do more thing without messing up
it has a charm of its own
just because a book talks about the and dying be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults
there is no need for an angry public or strikes
a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
if a movie is making fun of your race it hurts
books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries day after day due to their explicit content
the black and white   sticker
computers are easy to get addicted to use a lot of electricity and can make people fat and lazy
we cant believe everything that said on the computer 
i was once that little kid who opened the wrong book at the wrong time
the first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that
they deserve more attention than a machine
libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment
would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity
no one should ever walk out a library with the feeling of being offended
computers can ever help people plan a vacation or learn about a country on the other side of the earth
which person has the benefit in situation
if you are offended by some of the material thing you should avoid it not get rid of it for everyone
i feel that because of some of the movies my peers have watched they find it okay to pick on me
the romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing
and being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him
he is strong tall and a healthy man
people who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently
computers also help teachers
my reasons on this subject can be viewed in two different ways but i would like to view it in my way
after looking around he says
but to some more than others
perhaps we will find nature more interesting
i wonder if some books on endangered species of fish
therefore censorship of literature should not be enforced
when all their time is devoted to to computers if they took out the computers in their lives they would have of time to do such
a library should be a place of enlightenment
things like teaching them how to cook how to treat others and the real meaning of family
it overtones the point in the story which is to not give up and the will to survive
some were talkative and others were quiet
books are not the only things that might offend some people
music is a different story
but books are not rated such as movies are
they have an extended family because they live with their grandparents
i think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images
secondly anyone can post information on a website therefore it can be inaccurate
next time there is sunshine out no matter what season it is go outside and take a break from electronics
our government also realized the importance of trees
by censoring something as small as books movies and so on i think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens
news wide to this very day deals with drugs and teens getting more into them causing an overdose that could lead to death
censorship is purely opinion
she will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do
and you are not aloud to unless given permission to from the creator
the hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew in a way her warming thought of her old home
the next place was also similar
i hope you understand as to why i feel this way
it is used for plowing the field and drawing water
and i feel that yes i do have a right to remove these books from the shelves
anywhere in the world
you should keep it on the shelf for the people who want to actually read it or just want to read it to see what its all about
for people of all ages to obtain
if one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books
he also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things
this means that the day is hot and running out of water
if the players start disobeying the captain there will be anarchy in the field
but what if one day you decided you were going to skip your lunch break with friends and instead spend time posting a daily blog
some things on the computer are very fun
on whats going on
she uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn
computers are used by billions and they a great way to learn stuff about are whole world and the things that are on it
the terrain kept changing making it hard for him not to be thirsty
another feature would be the types of wild animals  scarceness of water around 
when the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms he had an overwhelming urge to seek out  kiss them and buy some bait
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
if an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not
this is certainly a great form of technology people should have
i checked it out and after the first paragraph i wanted to throw up
the pain will always be there
when choosing a book you have to think do i really want to read this
this last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change
the author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story
another way this mood of happiness is portrayed is through his writing about people coming together
just ignore it
are still some reasons why computers are not very good
also the heat first the terrain affects the cyclist
dear newspaper i am writing you this letter about computers in the hope that you will publish it
imagine a library without any materials that are considered offensive
this could help people also because do not have enough many to pay to go to classes
not only can this scare a child but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true
putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these
there are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes
people are getting no exercise due to computers
knowledge is just seconds away
i know after an hour or more online
you cannot control what other people do or say
of the people in the say that a computer has many people think that from a computer
it can lead to all three because those are the effects of being on a computer every of the day
a teacher can change the fortune of his students
i believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book
are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication
also the internet keeps you up to date on things going on in the world
the moment of breakdown was as she got the flower
it is free choice to listen to it
and very very happy that he did not just live in a house
if you are mature enough to understand that and over look something that offend you you would not be so offended
computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say
people are different like different things
new is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town
finally the internet fools people into believing they can go on easy diet eat
things get under people skin to easy
not just to him but to almost anybody
some of them being across the ocean in 
what did you use to search for this knowledge
computers are a huge advancement in business
i think not
once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would take your mind off of thirst
computers can also have an impact with your vision
the bactrian camels have two humps
how will a rape ever be able to be prevented
my opinion is to let them stay
honestly it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book
i think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper
either get over 
if certain items become restricted it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them
when watching a movie with a sad ending most people cry
when the cyclist arrived at the abandoned grape factory he felt on twist of many
the rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder
one strong example of this is how he expresses his parents
i know they can but can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem
she she wants to try and take it again in the spring
conflicting works of art such as books music and movies have always been seen in libraries
people believe in many different things and like many different things
after that extent the kids would be learning too much at such a young age
in result of this i notice that my brother does not obey or treat my mother with the respect as he should
with this shows that it was fun warm inviting and exciting
experiences hard times but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to bloom
i feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer
and be safe
dear local newspaper in the society we live in more and more people are using computer including me
also computers help old time friends and family keep in touch
it gives a whole new look on things
is in the highest reading level you can be in in first grade
is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver
meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles
then i saw a little child playing on the flute
that is just how they use there brains
she felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life
at the library there is a music section movie section and lastly the books
some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing cussing and even murder
censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested
it builds the tone and mood of the story or character
it should be clear that computers are a danger to society
they check you attendance grade phone number and schedule
he described his parents to be very caring and always put their children before their needs
it is practically the same with books
should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive
has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring
we study in the same school and in the same class
my mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job
what views what prose what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living never having the chance to glimpse it
 line   in paragraph  the author explains how grateful he is to his parents which showed him the lessons which became the root of his life
in the listed websites above and many others as well people can meet other people through other friends and games
many evil practices have come into existence because of it
the cyclist is our in the hot relentless desert
another reason why i think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing
there are many things in libraries that portray bad images and contain questionable content
dear local newspaper to my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages
the library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of
i know that somethings are a little risque but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution
computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways
my grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was 
the world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned
from the text it read there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
makes it clear that the passage is written with gratitude
the setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally
studies show out of people who use a computer do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world nations are becoming more over weight
many people do not like a policeman because he is rough
therefore i think having computers are a good thing because nowadays computers are very useful
it gives you a sense of togetherness
music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store
however some do not find books like that on library shelves offensive
some people were talking
the mood created by the author in this memoir is happy grateful
also i hang out with my friends every chance i get
but if you take visit there you will get to really last the food
you mostly just move your hands and fingers
you use computers to edit and put together your paper before printing
this is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water
just like the temperature problem the loss of determination could eventually make him lose consciousness
many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas
yes they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool
first off as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste
to make a better country and nation the people of the should make an effort to reduce computer use
which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places
i was going to die he says
  click clack that the sound computer keys being hit right now
i has so many information in it you wont even think a person it
my opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out
because they can help people find information they need
no items should not be removed from shelves if they offend people but conditions should be enforced
however i disagree with that
you can learn about history sports you can learn about current events in the world
you can learn about faraway places
some people think that offensive books should be removed from library shelves
as there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine
computers are big deal in our community
so if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside
she is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring
someone should not have the right if a book seems offensive to that person but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes
managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book watch this movie
just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book
our earned us our freedoms we can not let censorship take them away
spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes
reading books could give people more things to talk about
his father also lives with him
the things that remind her of home
when the gone was about to start the looked into the crowd for his dad
the computer allows you to do things without actually encountering their happenings
i think i need a stronger my eye are getting worse
when she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian
just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library
i also could feel a sense of unity the author was trying to portray
is it not surprising
the music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents
finally censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers
you can also do things while your on the computer hold your dog hold your cat eat drink text call
he arrived at the first town which was a ghost town
then we as people will wonder what will be left of us
i had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when i started reading it it had a lot of curse words in it
as he began to approach the desert he noticed he was running low on water
honestly the only thing i go there for is to read and to check out books but from books i have learned a lot
there are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away
without some limit on censorship in a library absolutely anything could be found there
some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things
it means that she will overcome all that and move on
it is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style
however we still have to be reasonable about it
materials like movies books magazines and music should never be taken away from a library
with the next town miles away the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there
the cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water
on the christmas day my parents gift me something special
this is how people use computers to stay in touch
i think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together
these ideas and quotes show the features of the setting of the cyclist
i think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature
you could keep in touch with old friends or family
cereals have a great nutritional value
nothing in this world exists without opinions
technology be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and be the best one that will ever be made
has that ever happened to you
he grows food crops
all of these reasons come together and say the computer does benefit society
so from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood
the computer makes you better at this

thousands of books are censored each year
eventually you or not get diabetes from being obese but most of the time you do
moving is very hard you leave a place where you have so many friends to a place that is so new to you
he says that is can expand our knowledge
a reason why i think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person not be offensive to another
the setting had a hot sun no trees and no water
he just had to keep going
we pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for to step up and ask for a room
i for one think that the computer was come to be one of the greatest inventions ever created
wrote a book by the name 
in paragraph it explains how he is happy about his life
that is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that
everyday i would go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basket ball
also you can use it for researching purposes
when we got to the library things got worse
it is not healthy for you or anyone else
i believe that there should be some censorship but not too much censorship
she used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair
i think if there was more of it i think there would be less crime
you can do many things on the computer to have fun
censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong
computers these days are used in the wrong ways by the wrong people
i know if i was a parent i would not want my young child reading of a violent murder or gangs
a hobby removes the dullness of man
i know many people think how come using a computer is not safe
in the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed eventually nothing is left
the future is not far away
lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days
i do not believe that certain materials books movies and magazines
dear editor i have recently seen on the channel news that you want to know about the
the native country of the ostrich is africa
suddenly i felt that i was in the fairyland
they say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do
libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library
looking and finding things you never learned about even if it offends others
there is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music
having these documents in a public library could interest small children in reading things that are inappropriate for them
of people have never even been camping
what be offensive to one parent not be to another
dear our local newspaper computers have a huge effect on people in a negative way
computers are needed and without them our lives would be extremely miserable
he always speaks politely so that the patients feel comfortable
computers do have effect on people
items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out
whenever that a research is the internet
computers internet access our business would crumble then the economy would follow
others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers which sometimes takes away from outside activities
libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well
these are any a few problems the cyclist encountered
it expresses the authors feelings or love the reader feels it to
people can lose track of time  be on the computer for hours
mostly in these three reasons you can communicate with your friends they help you in school and they are a reliable source for everybody life
they might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text
in relieving her mother in the task of planting the seed that she had bought she began to mature
writing a paragraph essay takes to long so use your computer to help you out
the invention of computers is the single most important event of the 
the users be over very quickly
people of different religions can sometimes find the print of bibles over there religious books offensive and there is always great controversy about it
if all you do is sit on the computer all day your going to be someday
students love having access with information around the world
once the store has lost customers they lose money then they might even lose their store
playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax
they each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written
dear newspaper i would like to tell you about computers without them this world would fall apart
the newspaper news and internet make events appear worse than what it is if it refers to certain people they take it offensive
is a little bit different with a student though
computers are referred in the press on the radio and television
so just talk to them and be real about things
as a matter of fact i barely read but when i do start reading i sometimes am eager to keep on reading
when the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved
some students rush down the stairs pushing each other to reach the canteen first
it lots people communicate helps in educational decisions and you can learn many subjects such as math science and language
people should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music
taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them
because all people have different views on life different beliefs and different feelings makes hard for libraries to please everyone
one had already started tearing the hair of the other
when it is too warm out it makes it more difficult and more inconvenient to ride
to her the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it which was comforting
there are the reasons to why i think that people should less time on the internet and more outdoors
after about miles on the cold his life was getting low and he came to his second abundant place
if keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons let it be organized chaos
in many today experts like 
now that i told you all about libraries i hope you learned something from it
if you think about it there is a law called freedom of speech
kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just setting at home
my third and final reason is no future
your an old fashion woman who believes in old fashion ideals such as no cursing or violence
imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters no paparazzi
but then they also have uncensored items
first of all being on the computer too much is not healthy
there are lots of different kinds of books if the books you are reading offend you look for a different type of book
computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone
more and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because of movies and what people say in books and in magazines
i know you have fun with sports or nature but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly
these technological advances have given many people the general knowledge that they very well need in any given situation
obviously without computers life as we know it would be way different
inevitably censorship will remain a common practice
make sure you stay positive  be safe on the computers
dear newspaper editor of have and use computers everyday
they will learn to use there eyes arms and hands to there advantage
it also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them
once the rolling expansive hills came into view the author let out a sad hopeless laugh
if the audience is mature enough to handle it they should be able to watch it
being the baby of the family he is everyone’s favorite
the advantages were their were hills to go down
the library would have books of all kinds
on the other hand children should not be able to reach or see some of this
think of your family and how much you love them
its all out of respect to people who are wanting to be in a quiet area
today in libraries there are many books of all types
i read that book when i was 
dear  you think people should stop going on the computer
you are able to learn about faraway places even if you have never been there just by looking it up
one example is when he learned the definition of family
we can do this by helping to keep our sources of water clean
i think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created
but since i come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe
do you want this to happen to you
if you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate
or get bad grades for doing the bad research
dear  name is and i do not believe that computers are very beneficial to our society
think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with
both of these things you can do without a computer
in other words computers are just a negative waste of good money
i think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library
they also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try
the reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite
i suggest that you will agree on my opinion
if people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use being completely legal chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet
the computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world
that is why i think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph
your outside about a few hours
i for one believe that computer are useful for many things
virtual sports be fun but they keep you from the real ones
first heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water he is running row on
the soldier is a fighter
these ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away
not to mention the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material
well sounds like you need to work on your hand eye coordinator
next he noticed the changes in the terrain
movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart
computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available
that is why it is recommended to make sections in the library
i think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed
it really does hold us back and is worse for our health
therefore i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society
as you can see computers are more useful to society then you think computers benefit society
and your culture
everything and everyone has to be perfect
therefore he was taught to become a king
though he was in a ghost town
it was hard arrived at the first town for author
no one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again
its almost like rewriting history
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project
money can also contribute to the addiction
which are usual signs of a desert
with having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst
it makes learning easy
in conclusion the mood of this passage is grateful
it supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about
some times they are a nuisance to the societysome beggers supply clues to the thieves
from staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water
another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers
some people have family in another country
some people are unhealthy from their childhood
these are all good examples of why computers have a positive impact on the human race
i believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive
those are all the reasons why i think books with curse words should not be handed out to little kids
i will not dislike you for your opinion and i will not look at you any differently
dear  i think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive
the mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood
the rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey
and you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button
the book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one
she would succeed in the spring
ignore the adds on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them
but i feel that we can find a balance between the two views
first i think people should not be staying on the computer all day
this shows that little of the  house hold is never out side playing with friends
i just put an example out there of what i have seen
anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person
there is a reason it is in the library and that reason is because some people enjoy it
we all make a big deal over something so small
hot  are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist
a few months ago i put a message on the message board on the website which said i would be on vacation for a week
the lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water
i do not like seriousnatured people

these were some of the moods created by the author in the memoir
censorship is a major problem in the 
these are the main points from paragraphs and 
what would it be like
i hope you liked my opinion about computers remember they are useful to some people but not all
another thing libraries need to watch are magazines

the main reason i disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children
there are thousands upon thousands of websites all of which can teach people different things
my cousins however do not teach their children about

i believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side

it is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that
he admired for his parents strength and perseverance

censoring libraries is something to protect you and your family
libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read on any topic they choose
by using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over
man cuts down trees to get quick profit from them
constant vigilance is the price of democracy
taxis buses and scooters were parked outside
as he pedal on the sun was beginning to beat down but i barely noticed it
computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise
also some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven
i learn stuff from the computer and it is a fun thing to go on
dear local newspaper you know how long you go on the computer for
he talks about faith love courage and just the overall niceness of his home and community
but what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books
it just can not be avoided
so can she
some books that are censored have great educational value
on sunday he plays tennis with his friends and also teaches me how to play the game
those things might be offensive to them but not to other people
internet goes beyond teenagers on and 
do you prefer wealth to health
i know i do instead of being home on the computer
certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offending to certain people
i was very happy when we went and i saw how beautiful is
censorship in libraries in our libraries there are a lot of books that are very helpful
there was a little boy at the age of nine or ten it looked liked to me but he had two movies in his hand
to his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business
in the memoir the mood created the author in the memoir
is entitled as well

instead of having problems lack of sun and just boring computer talk people should got up and go
he took one look at the game saw the rating for it and said that i had to have an adult with me to purchase the game
in conclusion computers have a positive effect on people
we all have the right to ask them to take it off the shelf and if they dint then they well get into trouble
along with moviesand etc
today we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library
the feeling could be devastating
provides a very valid point
the bible is considered to be one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print
often say that they are stressed and depressed
in paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional passionate and congregation
my next reason however is even greater
in conclusion computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses too much time on it and not doing other things
it made me sad to hear an innocent little talking about things that are way over his head
first thing is that computers are having a effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing
whatever it be called book banning or censorship it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems
these are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers
i believe that it is unjust because the girl not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project
even a scientist can not know everything
children and teenagers should also be mature enough to be exposed to all of the books movies and magazines
he also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go
many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend
if something is typed into  results will pop up within seconds
but they show how the character writer or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it
we need to get these types of songs out of our libraries
so why should other peoples form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon
not every one has the guts to say something to the school
and that is all done with computers
no matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive
he stays on the farm till the evening
if they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice
this can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers
in it talks about how his parent welcome refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
when we go to visit our friends and relatives we collect different plants from their garden also
i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
nowadays everyone uses the computer as their main form of communication
also the hills made the cyclist very tired
when she knows the flower survived the harsh winter she will realize that she can survive living in 
it could be online chatting and even sharing photos
i remember the time i was having trouble in math so my teacher gave me this website called a 
plantation owners of the south raised a strong objection
in a survey taken in magazines should that of people have negative effects with computers
also helps with everyday needs like and homework
my science teacher always wants assignments printed and how i do that with out a computer
computers help everyone
i used the computer just i typed up all of my homework except for my math
especially with fast food playing a role
in the process many boots stepped on my shoes and i too trod on many boots
in the passagethe cyclist had about different settings
firstly the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports
the author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons
for everything they did with him
the book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it
therefore everyone should have an ambition
the students in the hostels are looked after by the warden
we thank god when he leaves
dear  the use of computers does not benefit our society
stay away from scares and things they will came some people find the internet could be there from work or sites
some take offense to that
computers are sometimes dangerous for people
moreover computers can help you pay bills
if we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site there would be none left for us to watch
they will only go somewhere else and do it
if we timed many hours we spend on the computer people would be amazed at what they sound
many things can affect a cyclist
in conclusion the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically
also do you like using the computer
i listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was
just want to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town
computers have had a negative impact on society
the hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes
this quote states the changing terrain
using a computer helped hand eye coordination
day and night we are busy earning our livelihood
second i think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn about far away places that you have never been to before
when she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again
some materials could be seen as offensive to some people
its amazing what technology does
computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life
the reason for this is that this technology takes learning to places it has never gone before
a while it will eventually take a toll on the body
in the short story rough road ahead the cyclist faced with many problems
to  computers have made life easier for almost every person who has one
in this generation everybody is rushing and computers
further along he said there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
without them it would take double to triple the amount of time to do something without them
watching old reruns of the 
what happened to our society
like i said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer i mean how would we communicate or do our work
but who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer
we see many types of offensive material every day
everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people
i have been to the library many times whether it be by myself or with others
certain things are put there for certain people
also people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material
he searches for a place to rest where there be water but he is not able to
i believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive then they should be removed
this information can spread across the school
many people in the read
next reason is computers make life better
when someone helps us we should always be thankful to that person
we should choose how long were using one computers
if people were not allowed to take risks what would become of our society
one can sit on the rod ahead of the seat and the other on the seat
instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone you can chat online
the sea is full of many forms of life minerals and salts
dear editor of the  you know of people in own computers
where one might find information another might find it highly offensive and vice versa
in conclusion the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort
imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an a in that class
first of all spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising
you can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad
often people come home from work or school just wanting to relax so the seek comfort from the web
when really protecting them could be harmful
would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer
he had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up
everyone should be interacting with someone
computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday
reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing
more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist
i sat under a shady tree
many of the settings features affect the cyclist
now let me tell you why computers are good for communication
he was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted
the flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration
i would make physical education compulsory for all the students
he maintains discipline in the class
before computers you would have to go to the library find the book you need and then search through it until you found the information you needed
if you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine
i think the description of the setting enhanced the readers perception of the cyclists journey
see she was distracted by one little thing and her whole life was almost destroyed
john is a fruit vendor
if a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them
sensed that i had no clue was talking about so continued
she one reason why think computers are a positive impact on love and society
it just depends on how you feel about what has been written
most parents want their children to stay as innocent as possible for as long as possible and i can respect this idea
read ahead and discover why i think computers are great
at times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits
in libraries i feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books
i think the future will be based everything on computers
take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run
even some people do online education
some people say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday
he wants to tell us about what they did for him
i believe this because every year new and exciting and websites are created and make life easier
the mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful
just learning how to work them is a new skill
and you would feel like a tourist
some books can have violent language and actions in the book
she loved the way it made her feel
offensive material could also be learning material
so my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no
if not for solely learning but for reference
i felt very importantalmost a lord little did i know that this joy was to be shortlived
almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong but they learn from it
this is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward
growing up was the wonder of my world
during this time he is riding his bicycle for miles and miles in the heat of the summer
where he was at was in the middle of no where with no buildings cars or structures in sight
you go on the computer
but the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy
computers and modern technology are advancing quickly and more and more people are beginning to use them
now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive
computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society
when you are on your walk you find interesting new species
surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer
a little sparrow comes and sits on my window sill every day
it is also joyful to know that most of his family will be coming to live with him
i would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are
however in my opinion offensive reading viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries to some extent
some beggars act as spies
a computer is a great thing to have for all these things
age gender religion maturity race political beliefs and so on will all effect the way you take to a book
libraries are one of the best places to find those materials
in books magazines shows movies on the  you name it
why not just call or meet up with person instead of using the computers
that is so important because a computer could do a lot
all of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it
a child’s life is full of innocence
i think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves
racism happens in books all the time
being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas such as family friends and school
i have two things to say about it
my school has a big library
if i owned a library i would be upset if a customer removed a book off a shelf because they would be interfering with my business
thank you for your time
magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading
those machines also damage the eyesight of humans bulling is the worst effect of computers
having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses
most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions
the answer is simple
shows that the heat might be starting to effect him
in conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard
every book out there has something bad in it so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books
the cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some
with censorship there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read
we put our letters in the letterboxes and our letters reach our friends and relatives
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
thought would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting
materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material but they were created for a reason
most people like stuff that is interesting to them and some like other things
if you need to tell them something there is no need for a phone
that is your opinion and you have all of the right to it
in conclusion computers have no benefits on people
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful happy
if we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone
throughout the ages we have been evolving from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly
the last example would be in all of the last paragraph
why should the government be able to tell us what to read
might also be sending money by going to the computer and be sending to their family members
the same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away
i took the idea of waiting this letter
these books are usually the ones that teenagers read
computers have played a vital role in creating our economy
i have seen what happens when you take a book off the self
is vital and computers are taking this away from society
he is grateful that his parents give up everything that they had just to give him a better life
there are many way you can get this information
people could use the computer to learn about anything or everything
along his ride he meets some old but confident men
first he talks about his welcoming house
a second reason is it generally makes everything 
the time is now
computers are very fun
this is the best and most efficient way to protect and keep everyone safe
this is not of all good especially since person needs at least hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being
there was once a time a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she have never saw before
the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him
in conclusion i believe that literature should not be censored from the people
computers are a great way to communicate with others
classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers
when people use computers they burning fuel which harms our environment
it amazing because the computer helps lots of people and jobs
advice and invite him to take part in every social work
that is why there should be censorship of certain materials to a certain degree
typing fast and correctly takes practice
i think that if you look deep down into what it to say how you will understand why we need to do healthier 
does this mean that every library should close its doors
he made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and tested like battery acid
you can also look for information on videos
when the person no matter who it isgoes out into the world
computers are one of the most used tools on the planet
these items be offensive to some people and they be too inappropriate for children
something that would be offensive to you could very well be beautiful to someone else 
i went on the computer and in about a half hour i knew exactly what and how people did to live and survive
shelves that contain inappropriate books magazines and music will only make their number of customers drop
its just that easy
first of all people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising
when a person reads they always learn something new
also when it comes time to pay taxes fill them out and pay on line
the only on that this has happened to out of people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this
movies like this should be banned from public libraries
sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader but in other cases the reader be offended
however personally i feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people
they play it so much and it can mess up the and they can not focus in school
almost anyone has access to movies magazines newspapers music books television and radio
if a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened
in the student body in class of  at high school most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year
without them would make a difference
another mood is humble
writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts
they help you find information about many things on the internet
the author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired
political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story
i wiped the sweat from my eye the way the author described the hill as crippling should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist
that is we could meet people from lots of other countries when participating in international sports activities
you can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family
you can view many types of animals and study them
when they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there
however the one thing that acts as an escape for them is their gardening
and exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise
computers are positive for many reasons
other people can find out about places they might go
talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on
the staff and people there get so mad if kids are laughing or talking about something
however not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences
everything you need to know is in a computer
it was to shout the  so my family had no way to
me personally am faster at than writing
computers is the main invention that most likely everyone uses
find something to do other than play games on the computer
do you want your children to have bad images in their head
the way you want to live your life is up to you
they have two large white teeth known as tusks which they use for their protection
books movies magazines music and most of all life
i believe they are already censored enough
you stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story
last but not least people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone
it is taking away their life
without computers this would will be nothing
they will see it eventually
it clearly helps the workplace get attention
i think it has a positive affect
there are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist
simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints
since he was in the desert there was no escape from the sun
each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology
i think computers has positive effects on people like me
if someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable
this sight was troubled
songs that really mean something or about someone
some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that
in conclusion this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope good memories and fresh start
i agree with kids and adults not having time enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
will just take up all of your time
if someone who hurts themselves hears this think of what could happen
so when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test
its all about your style and what you let your child see
then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say
i do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure
containing inappropriate language and terms
some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people
the reason why material from libraries should not be taken away is cause the kids can still find that stuff on the internet
i believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong
people helpful is on the line with this computer thing
there are some details of why i think the mood of this memoir is happiness
kids believe most of what they watch in movies
she had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change
did you know people can loose weight by exercising
this really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling
ironical conditions for miles on end just to find some water
if i was in his situation i would feel hopeless
the thing they have to understand is that children need to grow up
he is an obedient boy
when libraries pull books magazines movies and music off of their shelves it takes away that right
there are many things in a library that if not careful could corrupt your children
he works hard to earn his bread
not with computers
there are so many things that little kids can see
you not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming
some people like reading books magazines some might think are offensive
you can regain a true life back with them
there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents
it is not opinions or false claims in these  only fact
it was also very hot there
for example in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall
teenagers especially they get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff
another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored
if everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library
if a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library it would be an empty room
a poll was taken and out of kids of them said they felt groggy and had headaches after using a computer for two hours
with the help of the internet i can do
hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die
we asked our neighbors to stay with us for the night
most hear curse words before they can even walk
for example half of my family live in and my mom uses internet to communicate with them
so by ending it with this and comparing to the geese its showing that she is getting stronger
the problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable
after this he was nearly over powered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well
today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive
i do not think so those words give power to the book
she enjoyed a certain website on the internet
the authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines
the cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting
i listen to the radio station sometimes and all the music is mostly about violence
imagine there was no computer for them to use
you not only read at home but at school as well
their faces aglow with this information
picture this scenario if you will a student at has to do a project on the in the 
recently it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society
or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day
for example she said that in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she would take the test over
also as the terrain changes from flat road to short rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state
if so then get up and go have fun
there are cursing smut and in books that for children should not read
when i get to use the computer to keep in touch with them
by keeping such materials shown or on display cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions
i personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch read and listen to
or even go to our local library
then after a few hours the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills
a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read
this is taking a right away from us and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once
problems can be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner
any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer
it affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has

there has been many people who have been hired

libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it

why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries
they wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story
is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends
i show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis
i think that keeping offensive material in libraries have a good cause to it for one very good reason learning
secondly learning you can learn a lot on a computer all you have to do is look for it
the features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems doubt and dehydration

this quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up but that she will try until she succeeds
not go and try to get it shut down
to whomever this concern your life without a laptop or a desktop computer

censorship can be considered as a major problem
comments avid user
they are very useful for teens in school for projects but they benefit adults in many ways too
everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book
we should be grateful for friendships
computers allow us to talk with people online
my name is  and during essay i am going to show you what i am talking about
the people who are addicted to computer are missing out an doing something fun with some they lose or enjoy to be around
some site like allow you to instant message your friends
it helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone
no books would be left if we censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
my third reason is computers help people learn new things
i will now get into more detail on these three topics
they would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever
and some deaths are around by a heart attack
well if there is i would be looking at what they are reading or doing
the last type of game is the tower defense
computers keep your divorce could have from computer
when people are on the computer they can learn about interesting far away lands
they can help with anything
computers help of future learn  with all these learning websites will be able ti teach them solves new things

dear  you know someone who lives faraway from you
my mother and pretty much the entire found it very offensive
writes about how told them what they did was a more courageous thing than ever could have done and his admiration for their perseverance and strength
if that were the case nearly every book would be out of sight but not out of mind
i watched them before though
the features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt
this sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime
books manuscripts and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive
now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible
first of all computers prevent you from spending time your family and friends
you also read about new subjects and learn new things on computers possibly helping you in your classes or
none like to be a loner
you could not the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show so there could be no possible abstract art
the children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are
the flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home
my final reason is that computers cause health issues and cause people to be lazy
if we did not have computers we would not learn the same
seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head
a production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them
anyway you think about the computer is a good thing to invest in
nobody has time to enjoy the natural environment and give a rest to the mind and body
there is only one choice and that is that computers effect all of us in a good way
you look at her she looks at you she walks away
a movie book magazine music or even something on 
offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics
this was the first step to finally moving on
we need to make sure our children be more convinced about this topic
others should ruin the experience by marking the words out
dear local newspaper i believe that computers are a great help to society i will explain my thoughts and ideas to you
this has become a problem
as the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs
of student study in computers and they learn about thing that they never knew
he also explains about his family and what they meant to him
they are therefore our best guides and philosophers when we are in some confusion
for example you find a website but its not suitable for minor
this not only helps physically but it helps mentally too
all these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store
also the mood was good because they came got an apartment and at the end every ones happy because it became their home
the mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one
did you know that of employment is from the workers home now you know
when the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes i believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost
with the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope
other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today
computers also have their flaws
you have another virus
he shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how hes going to die
these types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody
a home computer can save you time when you want to research a country person or culture
the book that choosing is called  
would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen
computers can help you so much if you need an answer
if its about adult relationships and the child takes it then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on
he was given back roads that are abandoned now
a lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end
also they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends
we have neighbors of all kinds
open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored
those who support a trances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people
there are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below
its a happy mood showing memory
its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country
i personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves
in other words she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through
please read on about how we will go computer dead
being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse
they should not be removed from the shelves of the library
for example in the text he writes over one long crippling hill a building came into view
by seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has
the computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world
some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert
with computers communication is a 
that small faint line between state and religion is going to get blurred solely from censorship
when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
in this world you never know what someone might writing
or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff
but this is just one of the many uses a computer has
in conclusion i think the computer makes the world that much easier
men in their sunday best and women and children in all colors of rainbow added to the dreamland atmosphere
computers really help the elderly out a lot
there are countless religions in the world today many of which are accustomed by their own gods
if your town offers all of these activities they are helping you out
we all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies
anyone can pick a side
in rough road ahead do not exceed speed limit the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings
think about it
this shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter and then blooms in the spring she must be strong during these hard times
how much could 
lists are made and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught
do you want your child to be the outsider
so basic computer skills are important for people to have for new jobs and common ones you see everyday
computers make people develop hand eye coordination
the cyclist had started out with confidence followed by determination then relief
there are many forms of entertainment in the world today
the computer can give you great information but only if you know how to use it
many young people change words in books but the books will always still have what really happened
also the geese left the home temporally because of snow
everyone should get a large variety
they think that they should get some books that are not found offensive
he bears a good character
just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings
censoring something is wrong
developments that have been made by researchers inventors artists and writers were once possibly deemed as risk
dear readers many people use computers but not so many people think benefits society
this made him more dehydrated
without ever leaving their state
books are much more accurate
when she first sees it its blossomed
first off the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle
it would be hectic right
i wanted to let you know that there have been some great and interesting books that i have read from the schools library and the public library as well
people also type papers and essays for work
do you have perfect handwriting
when one person is giving a right to do something then everyone else should have the right to do the same thing
the mood created by the author i would say good
those people are very wrong
all the road was hills and rough
everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online
it is time to go outside and have fun with your family
computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination
a benefit is bicycles are much lighter and allow roads to last much longer than with heavy vehicle traffic
i think computers have a positive effect
its simple if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries
i think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves
after all the world is a very diverse place and we were not all made the same
speech about   parents are the visible god
therefore i believe censorship is wrong
who can tell you what you think is offensive or not
there is noise everywhere
if computer are such a helpful source to society why would people consider them as a concern
so are you going to do about it
if this were done parents minds could be put at rest for the time being
it sits there and looks at me with its shiny eyes
if the music is rap pop or country they could just get it from instead of the library providing it
while they talk with friends with  it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball
young children need books to help their imagination grow
a library helps many people of all ages be able to choose whatever they are interested in
sections help keep books in a library but keeps them in a place where the right audience can view them
but the people caught him
i think so and this is why i believe that computers are a more positive effect than a negative effect on people
the plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again
all in all we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by
the mood created by the author in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness
soon the sun starts to beat on him even more
every citizen in wants to be healthy
if you use the computer it might break or not work properly
all genres of everything should be available to the 
once a person is online there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted
now come guy as a all pull it together
so the hibiscus is good for her it is some think she can hold onto from her old home
my second reason is people spend less time exercising
the setting becomes positive and so does he
i see the little plants grow
i mean come on how many college students do you see without a laptop
not a criminal so why remove books from libraries
until the final paragraph the tone in the story is depressing
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
some find them more offensive than others
the heat and entire setting made the cyclists travel much harder
the mood of the story is happy
there were even signs for rough road ahead obstacle was a mental obstacle
secondly computers interfere with family and friends
you can do many things on it
if everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf there would be nothing left in the library
also you can look up the answer online the internet is a beautifully smart device
the altercation ended only when he passenger had enjoyed the last puff
sure riding a bike might be easy but being a cyclist is so much more difficult
but these things can be done by government alone as these require big resources organization and manpower
lastly it gives student a chance to research a topic they are learning about
now singers are starting to make music videos which not along sings these lyrics but shows them as well
the average person goes on the ten times a just to get information
things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff
many of the books i choose are relatable to reality which often involves content that be considered explicit
with the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation
since there was rolling now the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop
not all things online are like that though
my whole point of explaining this is that its the peoples choice they would like to be on all the time
or it could be a story base on something that happening to the writer like about a death of a loved and how to deal with it
the setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through
 in my opinion the effects computers have on people are good
the answer to that would probably be sit down in front a computer all day
computers have positive affects in this way
my first reason is playing games
so  the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing
in the story it said
the heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated
they let people know what is going on in the world and give updates on the condition of countries and events
finally is the tumbleweeds
and it what his parents did for there children that they could have a better life in a new country
second you do projects or homework
not to mention typing a paper is a lot neater
the library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone
could get included in and join activity
then again censoring movies music books and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing
using the computer is good to do or not using the computer helps people be able to interact wild people that so easy to talk to
our school like all schools has a prescribed uniform
the world is very vast and every part of it has a different climate
the lack of water he has does not help
when you think of a book do you think happy kids books or mysterious dark books
today so many people think of censorship as a bad word
the books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn to do things
you eat dinner and ya just want to unwind from the days gigantic adventure so you go on the computer
it you fail then try again
the author concludes the story this ways for a few reasons
without computers life as we know it would probably be way different
you could also make lots of new friends by going out doors
it symbolizes hope
i think that the library is a place where people can go and research information
dear readers computers have a large presence in the world today
which country has more than million fast food restaurants currently functioning
they do because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one pitcher that is in it
computers are a great reference point can allow you to chat with
trees are very important to us
second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist
secondly every computer that i have seen is able to play some sort of game whether it be by a disk or on a website
you can learn also things on the computer
another area that is bad are video games
she left her home people she loved and an endless list of memories
nowadays there are social networking sites like   and  that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away
the pandal was decorated
additionally people are able to shop online
dear newspaper some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people
that is why i think computers have a positive effect on people
people will not be caring for family or friends
also the computer can play the favorite song on the computer
another is a connection of her past experiences
computers can also be used for amusement
computers have a positive effect on people because they are very helpful
there are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people
people however just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth no matter how bad it is
the features of the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
there is no doubt he will get dehydrated
do i believe that certain materials  such as books music moviesmagazines and so on should be removed
his description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness
this system helps people find exactly what they are looking for
no cars buildings or anything
that is what i have too say about that problem
now what about the beautiful things in nature of us are missing
which helped him dehydrate faster
in that time some one could have died been robbed and that same criminal gone
if your not going to finish it then why is it there
people find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it
in the library there should be good and fun books magazines and movies
many best selling books would be wrong for children to read but they would be perfectly fine for adults
they also help with school or planning a vacation
many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time
he should be humble and polite
basically the books will be put into sections depending on what they are rated just like a movie
on and he will
in heated water or you need to be as hydrated ad possible especially it an enduring in physical activity
for the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things they could be in a section far away from the children
now people have color televisions
in the says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so
that is not good for your health at all
another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it
a reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family
starting with what they listen to or what they watch
i have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual
the parrot is a common bird in the bird kingdom
the cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay
while his music be offensive their are still many people that enjoy it
the mood created by the author
with the new flower she feels like shes starting over so that shes able to pass this test that seems important to her
computers give us a means of communication such as    and so much more
computers have on people
people think the donkey as a stupid animal
for example talking on the phone costs money and why would you money when you could text chat voice for free
no one should be judged by which sex they like
this is a place that has already been through a and has fought against racism and slavery
clearly censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable
sometime someone have been an accident injuring them and they are stuck at home
in the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road
lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away
or they could play educational games
although we have the amendments there are still restrictions on what we are aloud to publish
in conclusion i believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf
sometimes you simply be curious about something your computer will be right their for you to use
computers are helpful device
he has a high moral character
as you can see computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends
neither or these weight problems are very good for you proving my point about the health issues of too much computer time
for example in paragraph 
everyone spend time with their family having fun together celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is
honestly all media actually should have their own section
dear  i think computers have bad effects on the people in this world
these ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place
plus many things that are offensive often remind of of who we are
materials give us resources and we learn new things
for example rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
wondering what is the best way to get somewhere
this often causes depression as it begins to sink in
a misleading challenge  but a challenge 
censorship is important but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust
i hope i persuaded you to like computers more
this means he will dehydrate quicker and will need more water
in this paragraph he just gives an overall warm and inviting mood
there are cliques in every school
one the internet there are many fun games for all ages
denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson
books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people
if internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future
in other words you waste time
sites like  and can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person just to talk
the third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people
magazines are impossible to censor unless you are the person receiving the magazine
i bought a platform ticket and went inside
it said yes and then it showed me a of information about
the choice to read or watch this material is up to the person and should have no influence on other humans opinions
no entertainment like listing to musics watching fun and probable the most popular playing games
the book still will be censored to be in that section or not but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much
all of the things are not for just one particular age
censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view
when a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves
the meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living
however i believe that from this quote even she agrees we in fear what our children read
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
they might also have to have an adult with them
someone out there hates these works and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else
computers can be used to learn communicate and entertain
most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence sex or drugs
this making it near impossible for children to get there hands on the wrong books
also since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated
or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more computer should not be in their way
another reason was that you should always help your family s during bad times
i think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test
therefore people have to be very careful about beggars
my friend just get a computer for her office
not only is an issue however people can now talk to strangers on the internet
now what do you believe
i like computers but i am going to say i am against them
you could see if anyone wants to make plans to hangout
well if you have a computer around there are endless things to keep you busy
this is why i think that people are spending to much time on their computer and it is having a effect on their life
while you can be on the internet for about day to night and still pay the same price
kids use them to talk with friends make plans and catch up relatives
media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do
it is so easy that it will seem like you are standing right next to them on a matter of seconds
a computer offers no face to face interaction
i have a hard time understanding why they do that but i guess they feel they have nothing else better to do
when books music movies and magazines are censored the freedom of speech that the author had is being diminished
they need to show respect for the books movies music and magazines they provide for kids teenagers and parents
nothing that has to be done can be so trivial as to do it sloppishly
she vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass
again how could they not be positive
introductiona proverbits meaning literallyexamples to explaintimely action neededthe ship and the crewconclusion
lastly all books make people more intelligent
there are people who can read listen watch and see what they like
read a book get outside and day but stay away from die screen
this can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading
i think that computers have great affects on people
 computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway
the removal of these things become harmful to a new generation in the long run
but spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels
millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day
he is one of the brightest students of our school
are kids reading or watching this stuff
computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends
you can get research about the earth and what happens to it
means that his parents they had showed him everything knows today
but they must come to understand that those same books help people tremendously
so maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck i think
he feels confident in him making it not realizing what is up ahead
you would not be too happy about it
books based on religion or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics
to get information
almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it
it would not be fair or right to remove books from the library
they also show unity by explaining how close everyone in his neighborhood and family are
in conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal
the biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die
if you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive
as you can see computers are important
everyone enjoys having a computer
the lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad
even books have sexual contact and language
you can just open a chat window and talk away just like that
that can lead a person to being very lazy
but there are people who can help them see the world better
maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book
so when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost
new technology greater than my knowledge is coming
today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials
so we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit
instead she stared at the hibiscus is what was important t
keep these items on the shelves
i am a student from 
if they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well
twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone
the author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme
most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines
the leading cause for this low number
the cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply
face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do
the bell goes
their strong points are communication and the ability to gain knowledge quickly
people have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around
this started to trouble him
another advantage is that when your on the computer you can chat with people through webcams
learning how others think too
the computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives
generally to keep my attention i like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot
who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries
shut down libraries
the reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought
they need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children
the idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated
how could they say that they knew what was best for their people
if i could there would be things i would censor but not in books
it was hard for him to keep his balance as he says trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
maybe in the future there will be a way to go on the computer but be active to
i do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course
she closed her palm around it and held it tight
it makes them happy
my year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children
naturally a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position
the author of winter hibiscus probably chose to end the story that way because then its ending with a sense of hope
what do you think about it
however they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising
the scene was frightening and i had no courage to get inside the train at all
that is how computers let people stay in touch
with computers you can contact people in different parts of the 
he wakes up at dawn and goes to the field
some people might look at this question and instantly say yes
as i mentioned before computers are also pulling families further apart
children rush to their classes and then the school becomes quiet again
they allow people to pay taxes online and type papers
look what they have given us today
not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people
as you can see having a computer can be fun but its not the only thing to do on a computer
these books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material
they think that it is wrong
a clear and complete access to all information how can one make any valid conclusion about anything
first comes the windy roads
someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures ancient history on them and learn so much
whenever someone is upset it is easy to give up
i would not have gotten that grade if i did not use the computer to do research
first of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills
in conclusion being online too often is abusing our social health and taking up too much of our lives
these sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continue a conversation from minutes ago
buses were late and overcrowded
culture and history are two very important aspects of the world
dear local newspaper you know that computers teach you to do many things
they will do anything to understand it
when you are on the computer you are sitting down instead going outside and that because a habit
why take away something that only a few people disagree with
almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor
that is hard for some students typing it is neat and everyone can do it
there are thousands of books in libraries now a days some are from years ago
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways
censorship will be challenged in years to come and i will help challenge it for all to be free and happy
people use computers to communicate with people far away
i do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book magazine or movie offensive
movies that are that offensive should probably be in a movie store that states that the movies are offensive and could be inappropriate
another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again
when he come to a rusted water pump black tar oozed out you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty
the setting very much affects the cyclist
when her mother says this she feels that she has let her mother down
and that is why we have fights over a book
the library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age
also your hand movement will get better
well everyone knows the same old question  do babies come from
also says that his family was a lot of people in his neighborhood as well
content that you might think is offensive is the content that really helps the reader understand the book better
thousands of students just like are being pestered just as bad and if not worse
this is ten times easier that going on the and waiting for the news stone you want details on
for instance making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard
leaders of a library have many different sections in their library
another reason is i go to the library i expect to get the book that i want to read not what others like
we then had our dinner
he is not very rich
it makes research connecting with friends and your easy
he was an italian inventor
i believe that all books in a library have a purpose
in the story winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with when they come back take that test again
in computers are wonderful things
my younger brother and sister are fond of my dog
removing material from libraries can cause many things approval disapproval anger and happiness
lastly computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much
almost everyone works during the week and if you not realize it we get most of our help from computers
overall i think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive
when you type you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys
the communication is much easier than talking on the phone
it can mess up your health
libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs
are many books magazines and movies out that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children
when the setting changed so did the effect it had on the cyclist
no sane person would want to take away computers
some even give computers to kids so they can use it to study
this allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch
so thank you for listening
and why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries
if a child wants to read an inappropriate book the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it
this lands them into trouble all the time
one can also find shops selling electronic goods
a library is a place that brings all sorts of people together
would you learn better with a visual in front of you
he writes i noticed the terrain changing
next it should be up to the 
talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever
sure you could quickly send them a message or like  but is it ever bad to do the good old fashion calling
for example there are many different religions in the world
the more time people use their computers the less time they are enjoying the outdoors
also if everyone could ban books then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned
the powerful words he uses in the last two paragraphs puts the memoir into a mood of love and perhaps even sadness
also with no water he could pass out  get dehydrated
this conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds her of home
for example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game
you can also buy computer games for your computer
computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored
many people have issues with their race or nationality being messed with
they should put some magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read
also the terrain affects the biker
she finally had something from home that she could hold
we were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake
between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life
a person who leads a good life is a gentlemen
it lets people interact with people from very far off places
a ringmaster came with a lion
the parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading
for example same good exercise
lastly you can enjoy you surrounding and appreciate life and nature
some of the books that maybe on the shelf hurt some ones feelings
in the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert
there are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers
after driving through the forest for half an hour my brother suddenly stopped the jeep
i know that i would try to contact them on the computer
when the cyclist arrived at the first town he described it as a ghost town
throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had
well with this advanced technology we have found ways to educate students in a fun way
a paper is so much faster than writing by hand
you might think after reading this letter
instead of exercising enjoying nature and interacting with real people they sit down and play games and watch music or movies on the computer
this is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life there are plenty more
i hope it is not just me that sees the good that a computers brings but anyone else that have taken a glare at this letter
not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio
it would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not
if anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic
i say this because people can interact with other people online people can research useful information and finally computers help people find jobs and make money
but what about the other thing
these could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals
so now that you read this i hope i got my point out to you about what a computer can do to you in the end
another opinion is that i think people should not spend most of there time on the computer
she believes killing is wrong and inhumane
the setting in which is cyclist is riding can help or hurt the cyclist
not only is it for entertainment but it is also for knowledge too
when they come back i will take that test again
all they have to do is hit a button
reading is yet fun but it is also  with out being in school
a policeman is a familiar figure
also i believe that it is the parents job to regulate what their children read
these computers helped to industrialize and grow our great superpower of a country
with out computers you really cant do any thing
for example my dad tests computer programs as a job
if the library took that mystery book off the shelf then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it
do you really want to be the one to take it away
books and music should be removed if not used for something that is in good use
there are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic that books and magazines
how do we get our children to stop getting these resources
books are sorted according to what appeals to what age
it helps people write better and better
they are helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class
computers are a great way to use in communication
a major debate of today would be that of the media
students do research in libraries for research projects and essays
out of all of them chatting is the best
that quote suggests that it is hot outside which would make the water hot
dear newspaper i am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people
everything is done on computers
advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible decades 
computer say there are available flights to your destination and how much
but they can still be in there because some people might want to read them
it is on the ground floor of the school building
the cyclist in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting
if someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by it being so hot outside that he could have had passed out and died
even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader
i once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology
i am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people
another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town
when it comes to books in the library we should have sections
lastly my third and final reason on why i agree is because student absolutely do not exercise
although equal rights and freedom in necessary schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from 
if schools are allowed to continue censoring books then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored
the mood that the author was happiness
the internet however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online
do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places
they both planted the flower and got a sense of relief
i believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves
as he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out
such as a homework question or just to talk for fun
most likely they would not even notice a change
now movies are a lot of fun to watch
please listen to why i disagree here are some reason why
all in all library censorship is very weak
i am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens
he also knows how to dress and heal wounds
you can even get work for students at school so that way the can learn more and do different activities
everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing
the only way is to close our libraries and shut down the internet
once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration
in my language arts class we have a reading blog that every student has to participate in
fortunately exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem
they are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe
to begin people are spending too much time on computers
he organized a campaign to get his country free from the british
going out into the real world might be hard but it is something that should be done
like in high areas like the top of the shelf or the closet maybe the attic
it would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder
not all the time you can find certain things in books
people will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to
some families have a tradition
generally most libraries are quite large and organized into various sections throughout the building
do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book book or movie was removed from the shelves
the ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much
she was very upset
the author concluded the story like that because she was being positive
i did stupid stuff because i thought that it was right
the computer positively contributes to our education economy and entertainment
if a person was concerned about a certain material they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not
there are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions
these children share what they have with their friends and these other children start doing the same things
if you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read
some peoples views on that is totally different but hey
everyone has a different personality and different perspective there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different
and movies and do business
its not using time wisely
they do this hundreds of a day
i like books better then internet myself
i think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions and using them in there daily lives
i can sister talking how they had that has to be taken using a computer
they control and manage the traffic at road junctions and crossings
as you can see
some people think computers are good things to have cause its fast and easy
for example whenever i walk into public places i hardly every see children just running around especially in libraries
it quicker and more reliable
this has not only made leaving  but has also helped in studying for tests for elementary school
as he tried to keep going he lost hope and thought he was going to die
why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people
well i because it gives us the information we want to see
in the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same
in every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste
everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see
thank you for your time
i think music is what influences a person the most
the next day she is on happy you are connected
the cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot
there are many free games like  that have endless possibilities
they have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie
computers make writing an essay really easy
anybody is entitled to his or her own preference
just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life
people have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same
people of the have the freedom of speech and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right
my and my have both used internet to reunite with old college buddies or see how far away friends are
in addition to schoolwork computers are a great place to look when you need information
we reached there in the afternoon and it was very cold
thanks to internet i have been able to keep in touch with them
if you go on in you could find hundreds of on one topic
they might say no
i remember when my friend moved to 
it can relieve stress  can be relaxing
is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart
that sort of crushed my reading spirit and i really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more
having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live
some people do go to the library an not find what there looking for
he thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him
you can also learn about interesting facts or places
he does not hurt the feelings of others
the information provided on the computer can really teach everyone something
my third reason would be buying and selling products
who knows developing social skills could help you in the future
i believe it is important you go along with your religious beliefs
are some themes which can guide us to a noble path
other animals that give us milk are sheep goat and camel
advancements in technology are very practical and have a positive effect on those fortunate enough to have a computer
there could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them
magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on
everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves
secondly children still have a good number of movies for them to watch and learn from that can better themselves for their education career etc
the mood of this story is very happy because the author is describing his childhood memories and all the great times he had in his home
keep or remove
i once heard of an family complaining about a library because they removed a book about the religion
iv seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries
for instance if people are on a lot of the time is research
could this be the cause of obesity in 
those magazines just show everything they have all type of naked photos in them
we could look up who was the of in the would get multiple sites on the 
the setting it the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit in three ways
when was a good smile run
the mood in the story was very nice
many argue that computers provide quick easy communication help children and adults learn and even teach balancing habits to our generation
this memoir is representing good moods and happiness
it would cause a lot of problems for many people
it is unfair if nothing else
therefore books that be offensive are listed as such but are still available to those who want to read them
 computers allow quick access to the news so we can find out about accidents right away instead of waiting for the newspaper to come
for example when he is describing his parents cooking
for example in the third grade i had to research hammer head sharks
i think that it is showing new beginning that she will have to go through the next year
they use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages
next the computer allows you to talk online with other people
second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids
most often things that are offensive is the truth
after he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the town there is no one around
it sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she or he fails the first time
memories of her grandmother make her sad but in away make her happy
you just need to get used to their surroundings
people do have a reason to read books that are offensive
so now lets see what you think
being able to play games store thing and chat with other people is pretty amazing
computers are a lot of fun
lastly health issues are raising rapidly
babies will learn to type instead of talking or walking
although this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that this woman was succumbed to throughout her life
these experts be smart but they are wrong
books should not be taken off the shelves in a at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner
certain books stay on the shelf such as a book
the sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat still feeling good and barely noticing the heat
believing he was going to die the cyclist got back on his bike
lastly a sense of gratitude runs along the spine of this piece
my last opinion is that computers are used for working online
i feel that the mood s created by the author in the memoir is happy proud and grateful
so now lets get to the movies that are playing in some of these shows
click on these and information that is needed is displayed
it all just depends on the person
now with video you virtually meet the other person showing how lonely and individually separate you can of from others
in conclusion this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence
one final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory
schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil
because computers help people are reliable and can educate people
the computer to most people i know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones
books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
he had to exert in order to keep going along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals
on a computer communication is made easier
with information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn
since computers were invented a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place
drug use  school dropouts  and crime rates our highly because of these same video games children our getting off the shelf
the library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction
they are an advance in technology and they have some positive effects
no i do not believe this statement for many reasons
this can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them
i believe are exceptional writers and promising producers and artists
parents should monitor their children while in a library as to not let them stumble upon something that they would not want them to see yet
there are many books that are offensive to people
some parents think they should be removed but others argue they should stay
after i found out what the words meant i finished my homework in about five minutes
there are multiple solutions to the problem
computers are great
social activity is good for everyone
we want to keep it away from them so that in the future they know not to use it
the mood the author created was gratefulness
last computers can help you correct with friends and family members
me  my have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time
computers have made things a lot impact on children but we all new things i when we use computers
it is very hard to keep up
lastly computers are good entertainment
the road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on
advances in computer technology are beneficial to society for several reasons
i believe that books were made for a purpose
computers help the society a great deal
in our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes
i can go on the computer and see what we had to do
the authors concludes that in the paragraph
libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material
for our generation and for the many generations to follow
children read about gangs and think that it is cool
this could be a very bad influence
first computers can help find out how to do things
a lot of our countries income is from our factories and companies in other countries
they earn the right to drive then the right to vote then the right to drink responsibly
i think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids
that is why i believe books should not be censored
make use of that thought i just told you
the people in his neighborhood were very kind and generous people
computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands
my friend often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents
many libraries offer music movies and magazines to check out and to take home
these are other examples why i think computers are positive
first he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking
you spend less time exercising interacting with family and friend and the impact that computers can do to lives in the future
instead you can type it quick and use spell check
they even have tools on computer
over all i believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be addicted so called toy
he is s stockbroker and operates his whole job from the computer in his house
the era of when the book takes place is also a key factor
spending so much time on a computer can really damage a person posture
in hot weather the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight water could even evaporate
i think that computer help many people in our society
dear  advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today
he started getting desperate for water so he drank out of this hot water hole
books music movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading
they have to exist with the affected the cyclist
for example one day you could be on and be talking on a chat room and kids could make sexual homophobic or even just plain remakes
this is what could happen if people are using them
nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of love oceans with pink sand
the fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town
it restrict the of the audience and of the writer which prevents growing experiences for both
people believe that using the computer is a waste of time
was being question about his birth certificate
it should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it
the country around her began to feel like home
this is because engines such as have of limits to with much information on the topic being
the cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration
some books are offensive but not all of them
since the whole story portrays this mood i will tell you some reasons why
they have lots of websites for games
i feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now
items are only offensive to certain people
the author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past
this gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence
this comes with one exception parents and children
however from the examples explained in this paper i have shown that the increases conversation and curiosity of how the world looks and operates
adults should be able to watch all movies
also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town
thank you for letter and i will an article relative to this subject
but luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water the features did affect the cyclist very much
students read books about the past so that they learn
both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home
the next day i passed my test
the main character was huckleberry finn who was a poor english boy whose father was a third class drunkard
if libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves there would be no material left
all these things are comfort for some people
without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened
when the road starts to get bumpy and uneven it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster
okay some book are bad and offensive but you have to look at it this way
i think that the book magazine or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive
they would be upset and disappointed about situation
as for food you sit and eat junk food
please take my idea into consideration
the librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it
i agree that computers do benefit society because every one uses one or has one it helps you with important stuff the computer makes things easy
also sometimes its a little dangerous to put your last name
make a say
they give us the ability to learn at home connect with other people and give a source of entertainment
in conclusion in our culture because are very crucial in our culture because it can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live faraway
the author made the relationship very close from everywhere
no one does
material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight and requested if wanted
because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated
they help people when they need it it gives people entertainment
computers are so much easier to use than books
the same family as before is sitting in bright sunny room their computer screens flashing merrily
there are about thirty students in my class
call someone a fool we compare him to a donkey is not so foolish as we think
mood in this memoir is enjoyable
everyone is not the same
strive to help them
not only is it students but most people get news from the internet
to her it is a symbol of strength and comfort
the cyclist had very little water for his long trip
in conclusion those are opinions and reasons to support the effects about computers
the computer helps the world everyday
if i found something that was offensive to me i would just ignore it
my hobby is reading books
also using a computer makes your projects easier because fixes your mistakes and finds everything you need
and you can send pictures or videos to people in order to keep in touch
instantly when opening the door i hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall in the adult section
there are too many of these tales to pick out even one
it also helps you with your work
 he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him
finally if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it
the mood created in the memoir is happiness and gratitude
first the mood is very 
in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
when reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective
these are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for
libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults
in fact computers help us out a lot
yes people have rights they can view whatever they want
kids even use computers for school and school work
it would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection
censorship has changed a lot
take for example your newspaper
of them are classics that past generations have read in school
not helping it
dear  to this day there are many people who use telecommunication devices like the computer
in conclusion many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many
this reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well
though books this material can be called offensive to certain people this is there culture and how they live
i strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out the library
everyone is allowed to express themselves and explain their actions toward a certain matter
in moderation computers are the most useful tool out there
one late winter night we heard the cry of an old lady from the nearby house
the mood that they author creates is kind of happy for what he has
though there are so many people yet no cheerful voices are heard
it has made kids my age more aggressive have health problems and care even less about the environment
at night when i return to bed  i really repent for having been born eldest
all of these activities require very good hand eye coordination
do not ruin it for other people
this being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material
the common people live in a so called  
that is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf
computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face
bad off yes i do think think they should be removed if they are bad
how times have you seen those harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple
censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from
when people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it
they teach you skills you need in life
this has happened to me before
i have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else
practice you the is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country
there are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject
the first time he mentions the setting he states he is in a ghost town two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down
i often borrow books from my friends and my school library
instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food
they play with it
everything would be so much more fun if you were there and got to experience it not just read about it
i know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch
lastly computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world
kids all over the use the internet to do class projects
no one wants to be a lonely joke
a healthy person has a lot of advantages over an unhealthy and physically unfit person
i feel like authors artists musicians and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want
the one against computers or the one for computers
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is trying to bike up hills and down hills which can be very tiring
when someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors
an ideal teacher himself practices whatever he preaches to his students
so what solved my problem
everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking
i say those people are 
it would have been to worry about those things these are all things that affect the cyclist
he tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water
in the beginning she refers to her new home as walking into another world
they even have grocery shopping online
the people who loved the series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them
people worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age
considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast
everyone is different no one person can speak for the whole world
it would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it
you have the same belief and understanding as me
i think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision
but interacting with family and friends learning about things around the world and your education depends on computers
they write it because it shows emotions and feelings
i strongly disagree i think that computers have a positive effect on people
bullying can lead to suicide
everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to
dear newspaper i read an article in the paper debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people
just as the flower will bud she will be a new person and thus pass the test
these are three reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people
the computer is able to do so many things
the hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better
so if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight
for example when the author says their were no cars nor buildings in sight that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere
gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight
you can do researching say in touch with friends and family and do a lot with music
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit the settings of the story affect the cyclist
communication has evolved so much in the past years
the answer to that is through our history
the cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going
now i can advance to the next reason
many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist
they are blot on humanity
if the person spoke fluently in and than he or she could teach you
she is saying that she wants to start over
however books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read
one way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot it is harder to cycle long distances
you could bring them anywhere you would like
when you become a parent you take on responsibility for the life of another person
all computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a 
but think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages
here i remembered
down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills
you can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job
you can learn about other countries you can read articles on news also
we all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read see or listen to
therefore the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons
would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read
they want to do the same thing you do so they copy you
you can not take everything out to please one person because it could make another person mad
computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like apps  and document folders
many people spend their life on their computer instead of exercising going out with friends or spending time with family
many people have been very thankful for this system
would you think that this is a public place and everyone has their own opinions
another horrifying conclusion that the computer does to us is rip apart us from our loved ones
almost every family has them
i had an opportunity to see a snake charmerand his snakes a monthago
dear local newspaper you love computers but fear that you or loved ones spend way to much time on them
one of the main reasons why i think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it
schools lose a great deal of money just to touch that point
they can come do there research and rent books
they might not like it or do somethings towards them in there lifetime but they have to live with them
computers can also entertain you
these reasons support why we need to have computers
that is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections
that is how computer games cause long term effects
i think computers has a positive effect on people
the many books movies music and magazines in the world could be offensive
it shows a sense of determination
if libraries censored every book that might offend someone else then there would not be any books left for anyone to read
there are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
every student do the same
as you can see computers are very helpful for students but are they good for teachers too
i know i sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that i read to study
they all rely on trees to survive
the dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated
like i said before when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time
this is why the mood created in the memoir is proud
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
if you would like to know what the weather will be like you can look it up with a computer
computers are the easy environment friendly alternative for you
due to his lack of water he became dehydrated and really weak
it would be terrible but if you looked it up on the internet you would know the truth about it
for example if you have a history project and you need to know about china you can use the computer
to get rice the farmers have to hull the paddy seeds
if you tried to take it all out like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy
i my i can shut it 
its all apart of life
most people do not go to libraries because of that
the setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces
lastly if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes
also some say using a computer can give you hand eye coordination
whether it be in books music movies magazines or anything else
certain items such as magazines and newspapers and books some of these items are held at a public level
you are probably thinking computers sound so childish and infantile
some people use the internet for doing homework
he eats grass and fodder
they are his surrogate grandparents aunts uncles cousins and friends
comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name calling is appropriate
i think computers do have a positive effect on people
show cool thing you have that are new
all of us have rights all of us have the same chance to express what we feel think or believe
i was going to die
this is because they use language pictures music and video
they are everywhere
thank you for listening to what i had to say
if parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now lock them up
the computer is a you to play it
many people think email is a waste of time but can help you in your everyday life
if certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive what would happen
i remember this one time when i had to write a final draft for an important essay and it was last day to do it
the hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and and it is a thing of beauty
that what make kids think its alright when their parents do what ever it maybe
many people are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face to face
let them find out about stuff when they ask a question
in the beginning it says of loss so deep  and at the end it says i will take that test again
should there be censorship in libraries
the author now had a solid thing to remind her of home
if it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person no one would have the option of enjoying it
people will always take things offensive
she is ready to try the test again
at present i am dwindling owing to the selfishness of the man
this type of music is triggered towards the three ideas of sex drugs and violence
do you believe that certain materials books music movies and magazines should be removes from the shelf if it is offensive to some people
kids them even teens and adults love
many issues cause obesity but technology computers take a big role in it
there are many people that think certain books music movies and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries
this book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur but i was mature enough to handle them
they should be where the people that are or older get them but i still thing that they should not be and there
the youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old
this feeling can never occur through the internet
if kids are more careful online and spend more time outside than on the computer there would be less controversy
if you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night
different subjects offend different people
i do not think certain things should be removed from the library
and that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves being endlessly read by consumers
we also go to the library to read the newest book of a series
we are so fortunate today to have even computers in our school because my grandparents would have loved to have something as quick and as simple as a computer
for example science
dear  people use computers more
keeping books away from people is not good for them they would not be able to learn from the things they read
it provides us with many kinds of fish lobsters corals prawn and sea plants
as a student i often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored
kids can get on the and stumble across things that they definitely should not see so does that mean we should ban the 
computers do not help you brain they can make you fat and for a lot of people they cause drama
even though some people not take offense to any type of  you have to think about the parents
the author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories
to watch the geese return
computers bring my family together by we rent movies from on the computer
there are thousands of books on the and many movies as well
with more and more people using computers
he thought he was going to die
this kid was only six years old but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies
what if that person thought it was a little quiet in his or her room
people minds would not be wondering learning or being kept excited
writing is a form of expression
it is what makes the workers to the procrastinators and the fit to the lazy
this memoir can pick the spirits up of any person in poverty that does not like the home they live in or their family
schools also are teaching us about the computer as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more
this is the result of excessive of computer usage our society will become lazy and dependent upon robot slaves and loose brain washed
smooth move buddy
this is things like staying in town with someone far away or editing photos
in conclusion society needs computers in order to look up info as well as talk with friends and co workers
second reason is computers make you smarter
i think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books
so should these types of things be taken out of libraries
i would teach them the subjects with real and deep information
who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone
that person might take offense to these commercials
the biggest one is typing
computers allow people to learn about far away places and people
when i was little i was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language
that is how the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist
they are a connection to the world like places and people
before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it
unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance
parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older they will make the choices on their own
to some this be one of the best books ever written
some of you might think computers have misleading information
libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it
with movies the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else
an ironic twist as he calls it
people are affected by this
these are all things you would not like your children to use see or do
we should control ways of water pollution
with a computer you can send a message from the computer to the persons cellular device
the more advanced computers become the more advanced people are
they have fried their brain from using the computer to much
if you want to know the mother and how to prepare for  just look up and do what you have to
flowers were blooming
it ends confidently and leaves the reader satisfied
its easy and free way to talk to anyone you know whenever you want
the is that people should agree
friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby
therefore people need to move around more instead of sitting in front of the computer
the mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood
healthy grateful and diplomatic we are slowly losing important
dear post i have been thinking about the way computers affect our lives
he mixes mortar and lay bricks to build houses he plasterers the walls and roofs with cement
and censoring somethings will lead to people wanting other things to be censored which will leave nothing
it is their job to show them the right path
just yesterday i found out that the human body can not survive without its liver
you can even watch fights you want
every kid gets bored when its a rainy day
i have never liked the job of physician engineering is greek to me
another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our  we are given the right to express ourselves freely
well i dearly hope your answer benefits the children in 
others feel that sensitive audiences not be comfortable with the text
and he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear
they were always having guests and loved a lot of people and considered them family
soon she will adjust fully to her new home it just takes time
the right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom
the postman’s life is very hard
in the novel   censorship is one of the main themes of the story
fake and dangerous info when we have book
so as you can see computers really are needed
this is important because a child could easily gain access to the offensive material
dear local newspaper i think the effects that computers have on people are bad and should be stopped
some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them
everything we see now a days is run by or has a computer
also the terrain was bad
i think they music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place
now a days mango fruits are very expensive
these books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing
if you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you
the people we have sent to they have a family here and i have heard of them using computers to talk to them because they miss them
if he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine
they sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind
computers do not benefit society today
was put in the story for a reason
now i pose question to you if all was deemed offensive material what would be left
mango is a palatable fruit
if people stopped to think about it they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others
personally i enjoy reading
parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at  and pay attention to them
to explain the offensive and the none offensive books that are out there
you might not like  you might even hate 
they can teach people many things
my hobby has helped me to take great interest in history and geography
not only does a computer teach me about current events it also helps me in my daily life
this sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot
its flat feet do
i am a useful tree among
it has made it simpler to type reports
he was a kind man
have we grown lazy to do such a thing as to get up and look through a book
here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance
not only are computers causing emotional danger but also physical
censorship is a great problem
first reason is computers help learn yoga
of those said use computers daily and not just for work
statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong
profanity nudity and crude humor as well as many other things are all over the media including books
censoring is something that i strongly believe in
it allows them to mature and grow up
but this is not possible without hard work
this is the part that is the parents fault by buying the for the child to listen to
i think yes
but i am here to argue the 
by cycling towards up and down no often it secured his journey
good thing that he is taking water or who knows if he would of survived or not
my second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is technology
in the end he turned out satisfied as the setting seemed more hopeful
these are just a few reasons why the computer is helpful as opposed to bad
a public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in
it is wonderful experience
we have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please just like a computer
if they get on that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offensive by that
it is much better to interact with people in person face to face
i am telling you we need to address this matter
i feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you  just turn it off
should find the good in computers and they could do for there
when the story says that the geese were  almost familiar to her now
for example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot
dear post i know that people are spending way to much time on computers instead of being out side
overall setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life
some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family
the mood of the poem is happy
eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated
my friend was not happy
this will come off offensive to many men and women
the heat made it harder for him to ride his bike and he also drank a lot of his water
one day i want to fly a big airplane
you might be able to see how an household runs
books should never be removed from libraries just because they be found inappropriate
do you want in obesity rates
she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home
i think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them then they are old enough for it
when the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence
what would we do without them
all in all he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him and very lucky to survive it
some books are offensive but there books and a library is there to provide books
they have forget a kind of family feeling among the neighbors
and even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present
the ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part in learning as a student
with these things a person can do research or use for entertainment
they might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature
the effects that computers have on people are really something you should thank god for
cases have been reported of smashing computers doing bad in school killing parents as i said earlier and in some cases suicide
these are some really good effects that computers have on people
we should all therefore work hard to achieve success
sometimes your friends
a couple years ago a was going to have the biggest game of his life
he had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit
when a certain person is on the computer for only an hour they are damaging their eyes tremendously
as he saw no buildings in sight for many miles he began to lose his determination as well as hope
their are many mood set by the author of this memoir
there is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more but to long is not good
i state this because the web has many things to do
soon people will be marrying them
the world would be empty because there is always something that a person sees as offensive
it seems that people are getting fatter every day
the narration states wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt
to keep the viewers entertained
this lack of exercise can lead to obesity
sooner or later five pounds is gained
lastly computers helps you communicate with others
if anything the reader might even like the book and check it out
this is when computers come in handy
have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore
they should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer
he tried the pumps but he explains how a far like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees
the cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with his name written over them
she is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home
they are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time
i had a pleasant dream last night
he used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day
the setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay
also computers can save you time and money now
be smart and safe
i do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people
she said she was ill
but for them there is no learning just accepting
this is not always good
thank you for your time
two if you have a library card you can check out books movies music etc
you can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results
not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over
i believe that people have the right to read listen or watch what ever they want
parents should take responsibility over there kids and watch what theyr doing
some people become beggars due to their bad conduct and behavior
sometimes i wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second
the temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much
that was another example of how this author was happy about his life
computers also help students and adults talk to people
for moment i did got caught up on 
movies are also carried in some library but not every library carries a movie
are you a person who likes to enjoy nature
reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say
books are another good resource if used correctly
in a way we are brain washing them on how to live a destructive live through adult oriented things
the author express gratefulness by saying his grateful for his culture and the sacrifice his parents did  
without computers we would not be able to be as social
the mood created by this memoir is a relaxed caring kind of mood
in almost all of books someone be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else
there is a book out there that you will enjoy
computers help people communicate learn and even provide entertainment
what if i read a book and it talks about my race or religion would i take it offensive
many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts such as the holocaust
it is his pride that makes the readers feel happy for him
i believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons
censorship the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye
should we have censorship in our libraries
they also have web sites you could go on just to play them
instead of writing the word out
we need to find a balance
ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for adaptation
i think this because of three reasons  it allows people to relax and wind down after a long day of work
it is a key item when someone is looking to travel
researchers are going on experimenting life on mars
it is easy to learn while on computer too and you all communicate with people also
she plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol
what we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so
boat ride into the night and it was gone
in some cases such as in the classroom your rights do end where mine begin
advances in technology improve society and the over all way of life around the globe
our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured
most of it has to be for some reason or another
otherwise each one will do so differently and cause a mishap
i belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like
i feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library
this cause him to slow down a little bit
she felt that it was from the devil and pure evil
if i had a library i would sell just about anything i could
past the time
you can save over a year
censorship is a terrible practice masquerading as a boon
i also agree with this
but with the help people are lively and happy including with friend
although children are able to socialize using the computer they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally
then i study for some time
if we need communication we have phones
this is a positive aspect of the computer because currently the has been enduring the economy since the depression in the
have you ever been looking for a book only to find it band from all local stores
libraries can help us in many different ways
have the parents show you their berth certificate
it also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down
in the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident
some parents should at least give an hour a day to say he game
if you had a computer everything would be easy but nor
if they are constantly listening to foul language and what not that is going to just stay into a persons mind
over of have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with
my second reason is kid might have to look important things up
she appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she
there are already all these other banned books out there why ban any more
that is the primary reason why i believe there should not be any censorship
you can make your writing cursive or any other that you would like
with censorship all of these things can be accomplished
in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the features of he setting affect how the author feels
you could get in trouble and it could effect your education
large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics
however everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone
your family is important so you need to spend time with them
the one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication
this suggest to me that she was probably home sick
this shows that if he needed help there was no one around to lend him a hand
i would say we spend more time interacting with our buddies and close ones online then we do in public
he had great memories of the kitchen smelling good
see how much of a different a computer can make
i will give you some advise
firstly computers give entertainment
like everything is going to be alright
some parents are less active with their kids
you see none
then there is the type of animal
when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself
if lawmakers give in to the complaints of a few people it could hinder a students rights and make students believe that they are not trusted
i think them is we the amount of time could be lives
and a lot has to do with the kidnapping
here is one example my older brother is a senior in high school
some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of    and 
this family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one
censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it
this shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each
and there was no shade are place for him to top and get some water
dear local newspaper computers are a waste of time
if we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop
over the past decade the percentage of people using computers has increased by approximately 
very big trees looked very small
now that their in  their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland and how there life used to be

after the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem
first we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before
i remember when i was a little girl  about years old and i always wanted to be on the computer
dear newspaper i firmly believe that computers do have a positive benefits on society
communication is one of the main reasons people use computers
when we reached the airport we got on to a tour bus
i believe computers have a positive effect on people because they can be used to learn communicate and entertain

there a books music movies magazines and etc
she will then take that test again because its a new start for her and a new beginning
the computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily
in conclusion people should learn to give some things a chance
if a parrot is reared in a house no outsiders could get in
secondly going on the computer constantly can cause health problems
there are millions and millions of websites about places and people
then my grandmother came out
have you ever been lost
the author is trying to be positive but its hard because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down
imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want
these boxes can be harmful to their users eyes
it simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting
i myself love to use the computer but i make sure to get off after about an hour
the crisp cool air tickles you skin and breathing it in just makes you smile
they might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like
that is why and the geese return
spending time in nature is that particular persons
you could live in and email someone in 
the internet just does it right on the spot
the section has music which teens listen to
it is a fast and easy way to communicate with someone
to one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new opposite meaning
they should have a section just for that kind of music
and he gets a job
you can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years
the section is there to catch adults eye
or parents censor what you children see hear and read about
as one kept her and culture alive through memories she would continue a successful life and pass her test
for example he describes his parents hardships here in the not with pity for them but with pride
now a days people literally worship the computer like it is a 
you can use the computer for playing games that are related to school
here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves like sex
i personally in my own opinion think that would not be fair
do people have the right to limit self expression
lastly there are always animals that need help
how would a library handle this situation
when someone eats a big mac burger should they go upstairs to play a flash game or go work out at the gym
in my opinion i believe that computers have a negative effect on people
computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther
also i am going to explain how i felt and what i wanted to do when i seen those things in a library that was offensive to me
people need to start spending more time on exercising and less time on their computer due to the facts that more and more states obese percents just keep rising
if these materials are using offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against that race then they should be taken off of the shelves
the features of the setting in the essay do not exceed the posted speed limit affected the cyclist in a negative way
computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates
in the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways
i just think of every movie and book as just a movie and book
in conclusion society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people
she buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden
no reading material should be taken off the shelf
if its cold you need a jacket
there was always one book that i remember the most named a light in the  by 
i am writing this essay to you to tell you
lastly i will talk about how you could do homework
for magazines they should have all types of magazines
yes there should computer are good things and are good help
that same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school
to censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens
using computers is very time consuming
maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time
every where you look people are using computers
i remember when i was about  our phone broke in our house
i think its happy that he can express his feelings to us the reader
i hope one day we can all turn off out computers for good
it is her good luck
true they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous
we have the choice to pick what we read and listen to
this is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries
he serves his country and his fellowmen
leave that choice to 
computers are changing the way everyday people live
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
from my point of view computers don benefit society
they also make it easier and more fun to make new friends
first off computers are an easy way to have a universe of information at your fingertips
but it also allows us to communicate with the people online
on many sites on the internet set up person locators
we have them at home at or at our work
granted some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake
the mood created by the author in the memoir is warm grateful and very palpable to the reader
can be offensive to others
i know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading
his job is very tough
the authors parents invited refugees to stay with them until the got back on their feet
when my mom lost contact with one of new friends regretted not spending so much time with them
there are some things that people need have in a library if they are doing a project that way they have the resources to do it
another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday allowing many things to be done by users
although i have all the right in the world to object to a book that i find inappropriate somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate
in this essay i would like to discuss both views on these censored books and why i believe they should be censored
now before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad i can assure you it was nothing other than stacks of cards
where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around 
the things kids see they soon try out
she is the busiest person in the house
he was also able to send us pictures which helped because we all missed his face
every single book that is made today has a right to be read
also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
children are not old enough to be learning about sex
if she is tempted by something from home she will not take it because it will make her sad
it infringes our rights
who wants to have a damaged brain
come on this is 
when the road get bumpy he gets tired
studies show that of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected mistakes quickly through and 
but people can also contribute at individual level by planting trees and preventing denudation of vegetable cover
the mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring and it shows appreciation to the authors parents
they resemble the earth and are aptly called terrestrial planets
almost familiar to her now
it was also a way to end the story in a good note
it all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library
many books in this section include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children
but if they have a computer they can just google the information
that is what literature is about writing
the author has spent so long cycling through heat his brains starting to shut down
well you email   or of course
not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via or any of the others it is nice to chat
i like to shop online for discounts and sales where i know thing are cheaper than in stores
another place is the 
the setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder
i would say to them that its not the book
computers cause you to isolate yourself
they are also littered with movies books graphic posters along with what i find to be explicit music
please take them into consideration
in order to maintain healthy you have to eat right and good in riding a bike
also many adults use computers for an education too
it was a very good statement
there is happiness because he was just born
quite often by the time their turn come it is time for closing
the author obviously had a purpose to write the novel compose the music or to deliver the movie
these books i agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races
also with computers you can share information as well as receive it
it was difficult to pass the time
more information the better the grade
computers also have different 
i met many of my friends and relatives with whom i exchanged pleasantries and information about the families
while he was biking he had to go up crippling hills
some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say
scary movies can make children have nightmares
writing is a form of expression writers can express their thoughts use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters
i think that it depends how offensive the materials are as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves
these books appear unappealing and offensive
for example the was further route he takes is not only  but also has no place to get water
man has always been interested in technology
i just feel that some magazines should be censored
all kinds of stuff is fun
but with books you should be find with your own choice at the age of 
why should things that bother other people be removed when they are not hurting anything or anybody
this is why i think computers have an positive effect on kids and adults
it gives everyone a chance to learn about things and do them so i believe computers are a great thing to have
these are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful
a student could not go to the country so they went to the second base thing the computer
some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something
pg 
computers have a positive effect on people
and if someone was allowed to censor things what would be included
using a typewriter when they made mistakes which was on they had to start all over
decides that he wants to learn but he does not know how
during the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions
and all the trouble it puts people through
so we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves
also because of the false information
they help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game
he was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback
he performs his duty in the city street railway platforms interstate bus stands and at other places
people make their own choices in life
the setting basically made the story
when it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf
instead of waiting days for a letter in a matter of minutes you can have a message sent to your friends
when you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen
in addition you can listen to music play games and check sports scores
but it teaches adults and kids new things
this shows that he is thankful for his parents
the library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed
you answered yes to at least one of these questions there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime
the internet can also be a time waster
the parents were happy about what they did and who they loved
you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you
their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent
also everyone has a computer
it is a crowded part of the city
the setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die
the internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method
offensive is a relative word
not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there
they can get on the computer and check it out right
it is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water
a person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product
people are on the 
everyone has the right to read any book they want to
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
peon is a very important person in a school
lastly the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe
if one was to go through the library and burn every book they did not like there would be scarcely anything left
what will you do
all the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision
the movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids
flat roads was replaced by short rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
so they are good
through the internet people can learn about places to travel bike and exercise while enjoying nature
she still has hope of passing the drivers test
no one can never make everybody happy
it has been bought to mind that people fight about computers to a doubt i think that computers have a positive on people
also  reading is one of those things that we differ with each other
the world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things
then i will take the test again
but he is not the only person who has become unhealthy because of computers
the rice plant needs a lot of sunshine in the last stages
if you want to learn something new or meet new people then i suggest you stop eating those chips get off that couch and use the computer
dear newspaper company more and more people use computers each day
buying the flower helps her with her troubles
but those books movies and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem
but this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world
his parents put love unity kindness and happiness in their home
the library could get in a lot of trouble
there is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer
computers have a positive effect on people
he talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love
at her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories
 my friend found out her aunt diagnosed last year with cancer
of every period volumes can be written on what man wanted to know and how he learned
how do we get it out
maybe and maybe not
hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people
and that their home was a place you could feel safe and protected
thank you for your time
at first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm and chilled out
also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired
books must be read we must give our consent to their knowledge
the computer being addicting leads to getting enough exercise
“the best day to accomplish something is the day before tomorrow”
in endemic areas people are prepared
you can learn so much more information faster
have a good day
the cyclists lack of water frustrates him and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance
but they can go online and take classes on their free time
books have gotten out of hand as well
another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs
this very colorful book is just screaming for your attention
because the setting was a hot deserted desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist
we did not remove any books pictures or even magazines in that store
please think about what i have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this
many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life
many children and adults too walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention
libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something whether it be a book movie or magazine
if you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights freedom of speech
he was trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state
communication with people around the world is a huge advantage
my dream is to become a pilot
these people need to get a change
another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library
with libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section
i have and while i was on the computer i could have been outside enjoying nature
this mood is a mix of many things
i would describe it as a fun
what we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways
if a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child not the shelves
freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material
however she will get used to it and do her best to do so as shown in the closing paragraph
he was going two
life is too short to sit around all day
the mood of the author in the memoir is that he is very proud in what his parents have done
we should be kind to each other and speak politely
i think we need our computers
i hope you are agree with my ideas
libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone
years ago people would have killed for this power for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to
in our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes
you can clearly see its wonder but can you feel it
he gives his thanks to his parents in paragraph 
censorship is wrong for this very reason
books and other works should not be censored in libraries
when the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again
computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information
if items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left
do you want that
we stayed there all weekend
the man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle he began to get very thirsty
i believe by following these simple steps staying active staying off the computer and spending time with the family
all the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child
the mood in the memoir by is happy loving and upbeat or lively
this hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next
as you can see coordination is essential to sports
they get people fat an lazy because they only want to be on the computer
so no there should absolutely not be any censorship in a library
they might not want to be around you as much
i believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph
she is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time
computers also let people learn new things
also she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud
that choice to look at that magazine read that book or listen to that song should be left up to them not made for them
computer have a positive effect on people because i believe the computer can teach people a lot
censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights
people go on every day uploading videos pictures blogs and just about what ever they want
the computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble
more you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher
we had to find certain books in our school library using this system as an assignment
in the passage do not exceed posted speed limit the deserts feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist
i have seen some great movies but i have also see some bad ones too
writing topics should be open to all people because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose
if you love a show on to and you missed it you can find it on computer
clearly people get mad and upset when reading listening or watching these materials but this is what makes us who we are
advances in cellular device has also kept families farmer  farmer apart
then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move
i recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to 
also the story says
history is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious
everything that happened in that book was real and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things
i think all booksmusicmoviesmagazinesetc
all of these books are educational though some are harsh and they should be used to show what is right and wrong
states shows of the natural disasters computer classified them
now is the time to get on your feet and find something else to do
if i were the principal of my school i would make it a very good school
also if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive what will be left to read watch or listen to
society today has developed a very unhealthy habit and it is always using the computer
then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
a journey boat is always very pleasant
i had never seen an airport before so i was very excited to go with him
without doing anything but sit back and lip sync
i was going to die and the lards would pick me clean
is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong
let me explain why computers can ruin lives
seriously if someone finds the song offensive then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song
yes i mean reading is great but now having the computer is faster and easier
writers and editors of the newspaper please agree with me on this topic
its impossible to type an essay without a computer
everyone will have very good points on either using or not using censorship in the library
are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun
a water pump found just in time but the water is no longer any determination they reach rough roads creating once again a more painful journey
we learn about our history for a reason does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through
that is why the mood for this memoir was appreciation
hopefully my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web
to hide away words from our children is wrong
keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves
total censorship i feel would not allow for people to broaden their minds
i believe that people should enjoy nature more than computes
they live in groups called pods and are very playful by nature
she was a window and her son jim needed a pet
so why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves
as i said before they can help people learn
the technology of computers to learn about the far away places
computers just up all of your time the average kid will spend up to four hours on the computer just falling around with no purpose
without computers everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life
i believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material
those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist
in all the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal
once my class was assigned to do a book project
this shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass
and hours of playing online games i realized i have wasted a lot of time
you have to expect that from kids now a days
or how old it can get
she must be happy with her life here in
being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes
is thankful for that and feels that is lucky to have such a close knit community of friends and family
some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view
another survey done by the magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one
why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school
censorship should be applied to libraries
using these tools cut down an stress and leaves you less frustrated
in paragraphs and  he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to 
everyone knows it and everyone loves it
if you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things well welcome to life
the faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals
parents have the responsibility to monitor their children
if perhaps more books had ratings such as movies do an cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity
if we do not stand up and protect our rights then who will
i never finished that book
the one you love could be messing up because of the that you have in your house
so by secluding the books magazines videos etc
his relationship with others in the family and society give him an identity and provide a psychological satisfaction
one day it was raining hard and i had nothing to do so i went on my computer and played minesweeper
so there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist when they were on there journey
education is very important even for adults and children
i believe that computers have bad effect on people
these are all things adults and kids need a like to do
different regions utilize different systems but that of the  or the for the  compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe
by reading this memoir one almost feels like they are at his house surrounded by his friends and family
to paraphrase  i not agree with what you say but i will fight to the death your right to say it
i would create a good atmosphere in the school
all those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading
for example a nice house or nice clothes most families have problems trying to pay rent and do other bills if only one parent is working
we go to school by bus
maintenance of law is his duty
there is an answer for this books should not be burned they are master pieces
if we are to live in a country where a man has the rights he should have then we cannot censor library books
he can imitate actions of the other actors successfully
they made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated
kids in the world hear bad language see fighting and even see people get shot
all you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard
firstly you loose interaction with family and friends
this form of technology is called the computer
most importantly the use computers is influenced in schools
i would give more importance to cocurricular activities
but exams are needed to test the knowledge
i can stand idle no longer
no the books and etc
the story ends with that line because draws strength from the hibiscus so next time she will not fail the test
the mood created by the memoir is shown by many things
always stick in your gut
i walked into my living room
that shows how much cares about her mother and father and how respectful is towards them
so i do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate
the reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me
yesterday evening i was doing my homework in my room
which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship who should be in charge
if the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children
it all happened in no time
however i feel that more often they negatively impact the general public
their families love turned the house into the home he loves
everyone likes something different so their should be different books
the music nowadays are very explicit and do not need to be in hands of kids
who knows maybe you will get a book that makes you think twice about what information is held in between the bindings
is a place where much business happens for the 
it is also true that some people are not getting enough exercise
text books calculators and even homework are online
the excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own
one reason that i say this is because a computer is a big handy person in reality
these are the reasons why i think using computers is a good thing
children follow in their parents footsteps
the coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth
people are becoming  the environment and losing important life skills
this gives a mood of pride and great triumph
the cyclist was lost in the dessert
the next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature
for me i only go on the computer for like twenty minutes then log and go back online later on in the day
censorship not only effects the learner effects the writer
dear  i think computers have a bad effect on people for three reasons
find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it
it is their right to do so
therefore on one full moon day he abandoned his family
the reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows
did you know out of kids that sit on the computers all day gain at least 
 shows how her attitude changes from cynical to hopeful
the kids what it but there is one book
or say you see books you do not like on the shelve at

it was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking with difficulty and made for an interesting story
then there is stuff that nobody should listen to or for that matter even sing about like almost all music
when the crops grow he harvests the crop and sells them in the market

i do think the books should be removed from the shelves but put somewhere else where a child could find it

those are the reasons why i think the computer has a negative effect on people
some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color
censorship in libraries differ in certain areas
when everyone learns to get along maybe then can this problem be solved
the author created several different moods in this memoir
if we have almost to no children or adults running around outside our world is not flowing too well
they go on the  play games and use it for work
this gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive
the library can be compared to a big computer
hand eye coordination is very important
the electricity that runs computers of this radiation
family and friends are huge parts of our life
let us allow our words to flow freely
in conclusion computers help as with coordination communication and education
not two miles into this next section of the ride i noticed the terrain changing
their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship
this is a big part of teenager life

on computers you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of
if everyone took a book off the shelve than none would be left
two days later they died because they had some disease and no one knew until it was to late
along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats
however there are still people who think that computers do harm
voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now
when he finally arrives at the fish camp he is relieved to be alive  is uplifted
and nobody should ever try to take that away
when the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump he said the water felt somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees
this is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt
the could be years of to enter the room
anyone is capable of possessing them
seriously it only takes that long for a child to be introduced and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there
it is never the parents fault
so it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it
the only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries
i feel that each book movie and magazine has at least one thing that a person can find offensive
you can be on the computer and still listen to music
the mood created by the author is gratefulness
first off i do like censorship laws to an extent

so the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope
this means that we can publish anything no matter the inappropriateness of the matter
well it does in fact when you type
with censorship one can not fully express there self or opinion
intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you
you can choose whether you want that censorship or not
books are alphabetically arranged in these cabinets
the is not always a safe place to be on
and this is only the beginning of what our lives would like without the computer
looking for some place to enjoy nature  it
secondly you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends
you just have to know when enough is enough
people love them and use them all the time
having a computer is great to play games
however some books not be entirely appropriate to certain people
i believe that there should not be censorship in media
it is a great thing to bring some light to their dark world
nobody was a stranger
the biker met the challenges and progressed through them with bravery
in the long run it will pay off especially with the economics problems our country is having now by helping us save money
people that read things and get offended by it should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not
freedom of press is a right not many countries have
a lot of business transactions and presentations are done out on a computer for maximum efficiency
when i was growing up i loved to watch professional wrestling
a doctor’s life is hard

computers can entertain you with games
the bus took a few passengers and moved on
my first reason why i think computers are good thing is because the are a good source to do research on a specific topic
parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children
within a school corporation the environment changes and the rules must be changed as well
the features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons
do you want to spend your time on or computer or do you want to spend your time in the real world
preventing a child from seeing a rated movie or reading a letter to is a separate issue from censorship
my ambition is to become a doctor
most of these offensive items are not placed in libraries because of this problem with people being offended
after the wedding ceremony the food was served
people should be outside jogging or working out and enjoying nature
first the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off
so my point that i would to come across is that use you computer wisely
this statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way
this reminds me of my friend named 
i like the freedom and easiness of a computer
while people enjoy computer nature
our teachers are also quite strict
but remember not to stay on too long
whether or not you playing games or typing articles your eyes strain to keep up with a small font on a website

he goes jogging every morning and takes me along with him on weekends
all i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it
could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students
it is a great art to contact the heart of child and build good character with lasting effect
if we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world
this illustrates the power of computers allowing people to do things that were once impossible
dear  opinion about computers is good
also people use the computer more than they use exercise machines bicycles or scooters
i say we spread the good word about computers and let every one know how awesome they are
he speaks about his house and family
the policeman should be honest polite kind and literate to serve the people
computers play many roles and being used for fun is one
movies are the same way they have ratings
you could use your computer
many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do
because of that computers help us learn keep in contact with people and are our future
then many words would be gone
another student might have loved to read that book
these books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor horror and empathy among many others
why i believe is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways
when really they are the people with more knowledge
people who use computers do not spend too much time on them we need them to live a good life
this shows how grateful he is for his parents to do all this just to give him a better life
because libraries are considered public places their materials are considered public property

people should be able to read whatever they want offensive or not
but whats the problem here
a good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging
they can always be a positive affect on people when they need something
when it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about
you could build a lot
lastly computers can be helpful with homework
therefore i believe no materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places
he makes everything sound really nice with every one crowded in the dinning room to eat
but not only do people become overweight they will end up more and more distant from family and friends
even teacher es lets the teachers communicate with parents so it helps you communicate without everyone being in your conversation on the phone
the be offensive to someone of religion and because of that the would not be able to be sold
just too sit in the house and go to websites
i believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children
censorship is a major subject when dealing with books newspaper articles movies and other literary subjects
he got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth
so the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist
computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me and so many other people keep in touch
if someone wants a good bookmagazine or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get
who knows maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said he would have been fine
he becomes senseless
we both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like
another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well
if you online you can in the computer
he was grateful for his parents giving him all they could
there is not one single thing that proves that
computers as we all know are a limitless source of knowledge
it was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome
when it shows time passing shes grew up more and maybe shell be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is
such as the movie store the mall a gas station a yard sale and even your public library
he should take part in sports and games
you can lose your wife cause the computer because you forgot her birthday her and her because you are on the stupid computer
this was must end now
why can we
you can easily just text her from the computer
so for his birthday he got a portable computer this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature
he soon started to be out of breath more always have a high blood pressure and he started to become overweight
i was in grade school when i fell in love with the show  
as far as many can see this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere everyday
it reflected his own desperate situation all refreshments in the past there was nothing left
playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer
they not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual mental illness people have
i remember when my cousin moved away
for these reasons is why computers do not benefit society
computers are also needed to do research for school projects
we learn to look for and understand deeper meanings
my family also believes that at my age right now i should not watch rated movies
with a computer you can even get your house hold groceries online
everyone is entitles to what they believe and others have to have the maturity to accept that
this denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple our own expression
so stop reading and use a computer
there are ways mentally and physically
computers should be for everyone
they will engage in music magazine enjoy a cup of coffee or simply get on the internet
but overall the mood is sad
this is lost hope
the features of a setting can clearly affect people
when was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone
this is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened and people would not be reading any books in school
computer are a great tool for humans to use for business education and leisure
she still talks to the people in high school but she mostly talks to her older sister
interacting with family and friends
these books should not be removed just because they are offensive to other people
you need a computer if your teacher require you to type things
they should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things
computers are a very important part of my life
they are a magnificent thing
imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters
it can solve a math problems easily with a built in calculator
there were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist
i have a small beautiful garden at my home
i think it should be up to the reader if they can handle a book or not
please agree with me
even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject it is still good for our to learn about what happened
there was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy
education is the growth of human mind
we live off of knowledge
most should be enjoying nature instead of staying on the computer
if they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens people would lose jobs
in a survey out people said they would do anything to save money
computers help us do all of that
many people complain to the when they come in the libraries
use you mouth not your hand
dear  i believe that computers take away from our lives in a negative way
please listen or your child could stay back
you can type learn about historical happenings different places and different cultures as well
people can also learn new things
one of these is the feature of setting
with other materials like books music and magazines there is no way to deny access to people to see or read them
they say they are keeping children inside doing nothing but really they are helping us so much
offensive books do belong in the library just in a completely different area away from the children
this will lower the risk of offending a parent or guardian
in conclusion its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved
so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing
this test meant more to then she just failing
being able to talk to anyone that is far away is good
when he came to a pump it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid
dear newspaper readers this
it is a harsh scream that could frighten you in the jungle
computers can also improve your hand eye coordination when you type
the fact that i can read about other peoples life and their everyday struggle is astounding to me
with all the things to do in the world we could all be doing something helpful fun or productive
i am for computers because you can talk to friends online learn stuff and play video games
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills so he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster
they cost a lot of money
the author of the passage ends the story with this statements to creates curiosity
they were an immigrants
war books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be
a library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want
there come a point when things just become too much
computers give easy to the internet which has so much information it is
some content not be suitable to younger kids
buy things without having to go to the store
most people would agree that when you have a computer you can just book a hotel online of going all the way to the hotel
like on paragraph 
clearly this is a great benefit
that could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not
families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends
instead of spending countless hours on the computer you could be playing a sport or activity
scientist say computers have positive effect on people
so many people are gaming now that if your not you are missing out on an amazing experience
then as easily as rounding a bend my troubles thirst and fear were all behind me
the river is even described as rushing instead of maybe violent
or modern day without taking a step out of your house
censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own
the cause stress and unnecessary drama
another time the author is grateful is in paragraph 
i think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with
so that why computers help out so much in this lifetime
taking books out of the libraries will not change anything
which adds to his dehydration
it is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading
i agree that this benefits society
websites such as and are also causes of this
computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips
three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people
this is because most teens sit inside watching or going on the internet instead of being active
should they or should they 
the way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move
he respects the rights of others
once when i was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that i grew up in
they have a nice home nice friends and a good and caring family
lastly i think the mood set by the author was happiness because had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them
i hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about
my first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers is the health issue
secondly people spend too much time on the computer at home
should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive
there are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are
this piece makes me think about and appreciate my family and my home
dear local newspaper computers have become a major part of peoples lives
also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more
with that said magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content
the setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways
you could have a picnic take a hike or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer
lastly humans health is being affected drastically by the use or computers
he was looking at a magazine out of library
the press is allowed to print anything and we the people read it
she was bright but shy and used books as her friends
but i was unable to get over my fear
he was wearing a worn out chappal and had a red scarf round his neck
also you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you in the moment
my first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick
keeping in mind that not everybody likes to read books they just find reading magazines and watching movies interesting
i think that it is safe to admit that we don need this
teach your children whats out there let them know the truth about the world
please read on to finish reading my letter
but the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance
it is a pointless task to do
if you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family
it is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise
there are some magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for children to read
in the world there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to
they can by tickets
do not get me wrong these websites are fun and cool
people yell at first
one thing in a book not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else
statistics show that people who are using computers excessively tend to have drop in their grades
the reason for this is because if your writing an email then you should know the keys that your fingers touch
he also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture
to a cyclist the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair
with a cellphone you have to buy the phone and pay the bill every month
another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them
opinion is computers are bad
we should just keep them out of the libraries
so instead buying newspapers or magazines most people go online to research current events
same thing with trains
once they put something out there they cannot take it away
different people have different hobbies
they teach us life long lessons
the race was nearing its end
his parents often welcome neighbors and relatives to join the dining
please think of what i have said and buy a computer
its effecting them
the way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it
realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending
this past i was in  and i had to stay with this family
not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on
my first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world
parents should not have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate pictures or text
you get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity
your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone
in conclusion the three reasons  the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer
the story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings
therefore the cyclist went through some though times
her parents always kept their arms and their door open
doing so will not only help libraries but also society
these are major benefits to society and everybody should embrace computers
all you have to do is go to a news website
they are harmless and can be seen everywhere
i went to my friends houses and listed to explicit music and watched rated movies
my first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school
does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad
this quote says it all if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive
i was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me
the spring season will come and new life will be provided to all
books are always important  even though i do not like to read that often i still like to read books that interest me
he could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion
it is the parents job to regulate the reading of their children not the contents of the bookshelf
just because certain books movies and magazines are deemed offensive to some does not mean they should be banned for all
it saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them
when my father went to bathroom for a shower bath i took my bicycle and rushed out
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
and for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world
this makes television seem obsolete as well
man has invented his god and prayer to get psychic energy when he is in despair
i think everything should be there
what do you do
even if you find it offensive someone else might not
i would also never ever watch a bloody gory and really graphic movie in front of her either
others find some books music magazines and movies offensive because of the terms people use
you can spread your imagination with the games you can play
also the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story
i person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like
next point shows that people are not enjoying nature
next time feel the urge to update your status with something like  got home call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead
at a campground in  the setting is calming and relaxing
we should make a thorough study before starting a business
remembers how there was always someone at the dinner table and usually someone staying with them until they could get back on their feet
she is all alone making her feel small and helpless
i am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries
when i have a project i always use the computer to find important information about the topic
this shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking
computers have been a huge convenience in a persons life by allowing all the information that was once in books to be contained throughout the internet
the next morning we went to the famous spot chail
all of paragraph is about how grateful he is to his parents
their mother keeps on shouting with them
but should they be removed if they are found offensive
you need to do healthy things to help your body
the computer also negatively effects people with interacting with family and friends
you do not need to get rid of them because somebody else want to check them out
if you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created
this story shows the love they have for each other and that even though they might go through some hard times
computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one
i have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive
that would be a terrible thing
movies for kids to check out should be educational fun and most importantly appropriate
i know when i read this line i realized all that my parents have done for me
everyone has their own opinions but i am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries
its fun on a cruise ship captains dinner and meet people and sights
we respect the teachers because they make us what we want to become in life
my many local in the town of 
 like most  has quests with varying difficulties
everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others
not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book magazine movies music etc
the mood created by the author is a heartwarming mood
the kids need to step up for a change
i once read that even classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read the of 
i heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop
first i feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive
were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity
so limit yourself time you spend on the computer
a life lesson of courage
there are a lot of other kids that do this as well it really is very helpful
about of our daily
why limit themselves to typing to people when they can talk to them
if you already have a computer then your fine
even little things like if your going to your friends house then take a jog there instead of your bike
i can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time
many parents or young adults believe that movies being are a good thing
my reason is you never know what could happen on the computer
this unbearable heat coupled with the crippling hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration
not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers
i once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the series because of the use of sorcery
something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that
that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again
the materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest
playing sports can also help you get stronger
many people believe that computers are positive towards our society
even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress in fact have a stress issue due to computers
you can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go
if so i am sure your not alone
first we need to take into consideration that every person is different and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library
at a young age i selected a book i had thought was a ghost story
next computer can help set up activities
censorship has taken a turn in public libraries but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries
books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them
lastly i believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on
these examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist
your children will see it if they truly want to
i enjoy reading
there are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen
the hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants
he had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration
the most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people
censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy
i traveled by train with my mother
even though the setting got worse through the story  stuck it out  made it to the end
so instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do
research communication act
that sentence indicates how much he loved his parents for doing that
in conclusion i think computers have not benefited society
i never could type but i caught on because if you are having fun while you it will be easy to turn
i hope you consider this
cell phones provide calling usage of course but they also allow you to text someone
this quote explains that the character cyclist was confused
my point is these games are teaching the kids nothing
my third reason i think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids
no a child should probably not in my opinion be reading about adult things such as sex
computers are a menace to society
studies show that out of people say that computers answered their question better than any library book did
the computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich ones life
computers are very helpful for communication along with 
with computer you can now send a letter faster then before
there in the bushes i could see a herd of deer
different websites can expose the wrong thing and get you into trouble
also in paragraph it talks about the wondrous joining of the different cultures in the neighborhood
this was because it was very ironic were he was
however when you think about it if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive there would eventually be no more books
well yes because they are not getting exercise
this memoir sounds almost cozy in some ways
later on they feel guilty
the internet is a good way to find out about a place
this shows the author is probably very hot
in our spare time we all enjoy to read  and the things that let us do so
the mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful
our country has hit an economical low and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously
we are teenagers and you were once a teenager
this be dangerous for younger people so be careful
if the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that then it could benefit both sides
computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage to sit around instead of doing standard minutes a day of exercise
parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read
in the story the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed
dear newspaper  you like it if your children stay on the computer all the time
in the desert his water tasted like the flavor of battery acid
without the no one would know of the wonderful things that our above has done for us and what he is doing for us now
your should be or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad
the setting affected the cyclists mood in a negative way
that to make a hopeful home 
bring out on the beach hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most
obviously there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature
this child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it
i believe books music movies magazines and etc
everyone is different everyone has their own story just like these books do
with what little energy he had last he had passed an abandoned well be grape juice factory which probably tested his patience and sanity
the speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a heatstroke which could slow him down
just a few days ago i was playing a game where you had seconds to type as many words as you can as fast as you can
teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it or someone killing another person
not many pay attention to nature and instead of talking to friends in the internet why not meet them at the park
adults mostly use them for business
same thing with movies and magazines
like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long
people need to within families because it decrease interaction with
increase tolerance people are
if you like to play video games
with computers being so popular people are less involved with nature
it shows the mood of how he loves his house
websites and search engines help you a lot
i disagree that most books are offensive to readers i believe that they just help the writers get their points across
observation when i look at kids in community playing is that they follow one another 
if a kid picks up a book about sex which i highly doubt would be on a library shelf what would they say to their parents
we must not tease or laugh at others especially when they have done something foolish or embarrassing
people depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know
and there are three of them theft cyberbully addition
you can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is
is there really one person who could make a such a choice for everyone
because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt anger and determination later on during the day
is this the way you wish our world to be
are you supposed to explain to your boss in time
so they can talk to their friends
so i hope that while you read through this letter you take some of this information into consideration
so while everyone is fit you eventually will be fat
it had basically described that the family did not have much but made the best of what they did have
during the you can go to the beach with your friends
so take a joy eat a healthy snack and limit your time on the computer
communication every where is fast and easy with the computer
see love can be found out on computers and a lot of fun too
the crowd was looking anxiously with gasps of surprise
for example i have younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids
another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others
some ways that they handle this problem can get a little extreme
they have become more popular than the library and text books combined
despite limiting exercise they encourage learning and the exercise of the brain
i use to keep in touch with family on the 
we enjoyed the fair and returned home
it has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone
another big problem is education
books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror
when the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills it reflects the turmoil in his head
we have to watch what we let our kids watch listen to and read
it really showed what he called home and what he called a family
many critic and saying not many people interact with family and friends
an example of this would be the society in the book   by 
well if you let me just sum it up for you
from this you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement
that is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with
so once she checked it out she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie
he graduates top of the class goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate
she became very lazy
a library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it
this is has the computer helps the world
computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
and other people should not get offended by what other like
spending too much time on computers can cause to loose time and money
reading it is a joy to some and a pain to others
in several ways one feature would be the sun beginning to heat down as that made the cyclist hot and thirsty
that paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end
instead of being on a computer for or hours or maybe even all day getting fat
also you can talk to them even if their in a different state
punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs
this is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation but free of charge
the last reason i think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures videos document and contacts on your hard time
why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways
after my father leaves i have to dress up for school
yes i think that some books should be taken out of all libraries
they get sucked in stressed out and stalked
a religion a person might be it might offend you
people have trouble looking at things in different perspectives and because of it they can cause trouble
if all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this
but you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so
not everyone has the same views and morals what be considered appropriate for some people  be viewed differently by other cultures or religions
this is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor
authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process
the society in   proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways
the road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through hoping to get water
our four fathers more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the of the 
for this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library
in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
people think that computers know everything but the truth is that their are vary little things you can experience on a computer
that make her sad
many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points offend each other
here this winter hibiscus
a mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life
they can cause many problems in your life
i strongly believe that material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it can not see it
i live in melbourne and basketball is a very popular game in australia
therefore the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation which in turn drives him to continue pedaling
for starters the newspaper companies use computers to write the paper
also when the cyclist went through a terrain change
for instance when i was younger i watched the movie 
these people can offend you
dear of the   a majority of the population will use any type of computer at least once a day
this can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work
dear local newspaper are several reason how computers have effect on people
throughout the computer there is many ways to communicate with others which is an amazing thing
people say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying
however not all individuals support censorship because of their children
she soon realizes that she is home for things have come familiar to her such as the v formation of the geese
but people would kill for these games
people will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is so why is censorship such a big deal
the rolling hills poisonous snake and the conditions of the road worried her
have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer
its a good way to make an online friends
as a result this is why the author ended the story with that
the former quote was found in paragraph described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived
certain books movies magazines and music should not be accessed by everyone
it reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish
thus the order becomes a habit
his water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die
sending and receiving letters can take days or weeks on the other hand instant messaging takes only a few seconds
which i find really weird because things like that are going to happen in life
the author is constantly talking about and remembering what her home was like when she was growing up
allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library
it makes things that would other wise take lots of time very quick giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside
also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that
dear local newspaper i think that computers effect people in a positive way
computers have opened up so many opportunities the world needs to lake
computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them
both of these diseases are lethal
when it blooms she will have a true piece of home with her and will be able to take the test again
finally computers take away family but also schoolwork and works
computers are great writing tools
we need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn
those four hours could be spent with their families
but last sunday was different
though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school
the most important thing i think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph 
have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive
a whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful
they should not have to think that way going to a library
my mom keeps the books and managers many things for a company
sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf
this prosperity has been possible using hard work
as you reading you will find out my second reason fro being to much in the computer
the library has a section for adults
the answer is that they can
computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends
this is how the mood was happy and made me thankful
people were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the 
another reason is the computer can help you study a place too
her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared
lastly the author creates a mood bravery and caring
do you think people spend to much time on the computer do
see what happens
so if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it we would have nothing left in this world today
along with the internet there are programs such as  and  which help people to learn a new language or write on the computer
i was recently assigned a project by my social studies teacher where we got to choose my topic of community service and research it
in addition to limiting diet and exercise computers are also the source of yet another act
i believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them
do you want a bad grades
that many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative
she is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge
i think people should get their schoolwork done and get off

this author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work be recognized
magazines about how we sex and kill each other
the middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home
what started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride
because you are not doing nothing just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat
make us feel like we have to go out and try it
i also think it good research to browse people
if they wish to talk about dragons and princesses so be it
this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels
they should not be removed from the shelves
in the story it says i toiled on
everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read listen to or watch
they help us in find  medical research and to tell weather or not you have cancer
i do we could also send much other pictures music and lot more
people have the freedom of speech
all living things need water to survive
i hope you go out and buy a computer after reading this
we were walking down street when a bolt of lighting struck through the trees
the author of winter hibiscus ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes
the constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character
these views are based on what most people of a time frame believed
also you can interact with friends and family members by email etc
she feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus
the mood of this memoir is grateful and content
statistics show that out of people say tennis have actually made them more confident
authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about
by sending a letter it can take a while
there is hardly any disease
he keeps a small stick in his hand
the only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button
that is why computers are needed
as i mentioned computers bring about online communications
i like my house very much
therefore the features of the setting affect the cyclist
selfishness also leads to evil
secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes
at many schools students are asked to write research papers
have no fear the online textbook is here
people is a function that and does where you order your online and they drop it off
the creates a mood of happiness in the 
about the other films
he said sometimes life can be so cruel
for example your computer breaks or has virus you can just figure out the problem by yourself
this made the cyclist tired and weary
when you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot you should really just visit that place
he also showed me the rich dresses and ornaments of kings and queens
i makes them blind to enjoy nature
people in schools industries and in homes use it all the time
everyone in the neighborhood is so welcoming he tells us how his mother always leaves the door open for those who welcome her in
you should have a section for children in libraries
there is nothing but nude women in there
we ate apples and sweets
it is tone of love because he explains that his parents taught him many great things
the author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible something will be the to lift your spirits
stamps collecting is still one of the world’s most popular indoor hobbies
that is his or her own personal opinion and what i believe should not keep him or her from learning about the things they would like to
people are afraid that they are limiting themselves from interacting to  and spending time enjoying nature
for instance the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink
for example in the story he says id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate
not only do computer help out educationally they are probably the must well known information centers
i am ready to study and work hard to fulfill my dream of flying high among the stars
at last my brother came home and i was happy
this quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing
i am against any material that are offensive to someone or something else
after a few times of using a computer you get and better it
thanks to the computer i got accurate information
that can cause failure in school or getting fired at work
is also great way to meet new people
have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching
a few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is
in a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on
if everyone found it offensive no one would buy or read it and because of that it would no longer be produced
therefore you know where you want to book your next visit
he is an architect and runs his own company
this meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated
the second problem is stealing music getting it for free
the government should raise his salary and lighten his work
besides everybody likes having fun
there are three reason on to here more
we were outside every single day even if we were just staring into the clouds
these cases being music or movies
due to the fact they never left their porches
many kids do not do any type of athletic sport
she would keep trying till she got it right
these are the authors mood in the memoir
if you do not cuss and say you go watch   you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word
the author ends the story this way for a few reasons
her mother then comes and shares the moment with her
if we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant
the fact that the author is running out of water makes continuing on a very stressful
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
you can study different foods and cultures around the world
in my opinion censorship in libraries whether by government or other civilians should be allowed
they let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes
if they believe the material is too mature for their child they could restrict them
when the rough road affect sign appeared the travel then become more difficult
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways
people work from home all the time
studies show that in the  out of people were overweight
could mean she realizes what happens happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want
so why should those things be
you can avoid things you find offensive
you have your own choice when it comes to what your children read watch and listen to
dear  i strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
she takes it home and put it in the garden
on this homework
in my opinion you should just read what interests you watch what you like and listen to the songs you usually listen to
in the book  firemen would burn any book seen within a home
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
so you should go to the library but no one can take you
but on the other feel that the if he can make their decisions in what is right
also you can spent your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book flight ticket for vacation
some factories release waste material into waterways
if a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelve at his or her own will
they also put the news on there website
there are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends
personally i think computers have a good influence on people
adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers
the next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again
i had to go to the to get it
people choose how community they exercise on the computers
as the cyclist prepares to retire for the day he takes particular note of the serenity of an early summer evening and ends the day feeling calm
we began video taping a posting
at the moment she is just homesick even if her home is the now
i could go on for hours listing at the different types
they refresh themselves for the remaining periods
birdie and i have become real good friends
students use the for many reasons
he did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town
finally computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you
some comedy and action movies are viewed as offensive or inappropriate to some people but many others enjoy the movie
another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting
respect what other cultures and ways of life do and stay away from what offends you
if you think books should be censored then think about this
parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so
you can even find out how much an average family pays  every year
it is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants
computers can teach children by showing them new words colors shapes and sizes
their attention is more on the watch than what the teacher is trying to teach
why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun
libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in 
when the flat terrain turned to rolling hills the man was entirely exhausted
another example is that overtime the strain build up and up to the where even with glasses you can hardly see
there was a sign that posted a max speed limit
these things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also
without them there would be no books for anybody to read
in order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself
the first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the or the of your state
of my family also live far away
if we were not introduced to it so early we would not be going behind our parents backs trying to do it
that law still exists and has been used many times to defend people arguing to keep their work their words and their ideas out in the world
they are on the computers when they should be exercising
i would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world
experts you do not need to worry
banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons
computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world
therefore libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf
she complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them
computers are often helpful to those with special needs
he was having heaps of books on all sides of his table and in shelves
this also gives people the chance to socialize with people from all over the world
everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do
they allow people to learn many new skills get important work done and even socialize
some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that will past the test
are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road
the web site listed above can really make you forget about reality
they also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation
more people make a website that allows us to easily keep up with our distant family
dear  name is and i am here to give you opinions about computers
i have a cousin who is and he plays games on it all the time he even knows how to search something on the computer
those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication
computers have a negative effect on people
all sort of people can be seen at a bus stop
business and commercial line is just the thing which i hate
i hope you too heed to my advice
he thinks of the nation first and of himself later
flicks like and use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago
if it were not for the library having the on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her
i believe that there should be censorship in public libraries
you can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from
so as can be seen
do you want that for our youth
so he had no energy because of dehydration
most everyone owns a computer and almost everyone needs one
our teacher also encourage us to use computers
he was given to his parents by the scouts
with the quote in the introduction paragraph or the one in the question it was written as a sign of symbolism
people need to know the true meaning of what is being said
they can not censor things just because some people find them offensive
this leads into eating unhealthy foods
just like from the picture of the hibiscus flower next to the highway
different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things
but its gets to you
also people should be able to speak their minds
you the parents are heading to work while your child goes to and enters into the wonderful learning center computers
the author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written not the way you would like to see it
no one is forcing you to read it or look at it
if we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here then we begin to lose ourselves
on my last birthday my father gifted me a toy plane
they are what i understand from the story newcomers to a country
magazines could just be in a library for people to read and relax and learn something new in the world
the author thanks his parents several times
it traveled at a good speed although there was a lot of traffic on the way
we all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like 
the last thing we need in our society is fighting
another reason why a computer is not needed is many people neglect pure nature
the most important use for computers is learning
without computers would not know the important news when needed to or information needed for a specific moment
as i stated earlier libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills
i have read many books that have inappropriate words in them
a lot of people use a computer for fun
some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas
this effected my life a lot i stopped going out on weekends with my friends i always wanted to stay home when my family wont out
second the road was getting harder to travel
many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page
she thinks she can pass it next time
in this memoir of the author creates a clear mood
now imagine this your sitting in front of a computer in a hot stuffy room
you can email instead of using letters
of obesity is caused by the use of computers
this means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in  and they might not get the pay they deserve
we are just taking away something that is really big to us  and without those books there is no history for us to study
these computers help the students complete research papers typed assignments and other teacher requirement papers
one year i found out the my great grandmother died of cancer
books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas
take it down
i think that there should be a time limit for everyone on the computer
offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens
people always saying kids should read more
loved him and they elected him as their president
this is the mood expressed in the memoir
computers just make you break away from your family and friends because your worrying whats happening on the internet
as you can see the internet is a valuable learning tool
i have also experienced censorship in local library
take twitter as a example
do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible
there are better entertainment active and will keep us healthy and exercising
so computer help the community
on the news you hear about obesity
the significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the budding
many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer but is that really such a good thing
a few months ago i was at the local library searching for the perfect book
there are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question
what are you to do
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
these websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research
the second reason is the computer help you in your house for example you have the big problem with your car or something like that
the plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad
or go to a store that sells books and is a little more censored
people of different races and cultures have another opinion on the situation of censorship
they do not stop playing it because someone having different feelings about the movie
to make everyone happy the person could just not listen it
this is why i think computers have a positive affect on people
everyone should have a computer because you can chat with people
fewer people went out to admire its beauty
according to a study done by the  the largest cause obesity is actually computers
well my time is up here
many kids who there homework on computers are very easily distracted
this is the same for the books that are on library shelves
if people are wasting away staring at their computer screen and not getting any sort or exercise in the number will get bigger
thick smoke was coming out of the house
if people want to see about a restaurant store or product they can do that online
there is an adult section for adults not children people need to realize that
computers give you more resources than a book
reason one you loose interaction with people
i started crying with fear
there are two books that i read called the and 
when computer first came out people bought them to see what they will be like
computers have caused damage to people
the internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet
children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher
this is why most endings are meaningful like this
this gives a loving and caring feeling
those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer
personally i have never found a book song or movie to be offensive to me
one affect was the lack of water in the area he was in which was a dessert
first of all i would like to talk about how computer can help us with anything
the desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow
it could be on the radio on the internet on the and what can you do delete all of that
not only the people blood related to your is your family but also friends and anyone close to you
should we censor books in libraries
do you always think about vulgar inappropriate pictures and illegal images
our eyes are looking while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard
also those been who suicide because they were bulled on the 
everyone has a favorite book
he could not get any water or any directions
being tired from no water the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike
some people think that computers take up too much time for the important things
have you gain weight just from staying on the computer for too long
these are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives
she teaches me how to plant and take care of them
this is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials
this helps because it also saves time
in conclusion i hope i have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly
that has been taken out of your local library
so pride  happiness are the mood
they are the one how allow us to read it watch it listen to it or even play it
that is where my opinion will start and tell why it is that way
at this point the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals
i cannot think of a life without her
some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends
our earth is one of them
when you just want to see someone il costs you money to get on a phone 
first he author talks about how her parents give up what ever they had for them
then it was a waste of money to make the building purchase the books for people and hire librarians
i think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did to show that you can always change
not just some people
it is like they are part of our daily vocabulary now
in the memoir the authors tone is loving
people all over the world use computers for something important in case of emergency and much more
as the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water
different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive
having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library
dear local newspaper
i read an article on the web page and on paragraph sec
i hope that my kid whats to be something that he likes to do when he grows up
this is happening all around the world and it need to 
they had to find new jobs and give their child a happy life
it was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times
being with your family can make your bond between each other stronger and you can get along with each other better
although i am lucky that my mother cares about what i read some parents are not
and thank you for having time to read this
if one finds a book offensive look in a different section
now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then yes by all means remove them
if advances continue that number will increase and other problems arise from it
the mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family
online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with
everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore there should not be censorship in libraries
the rice plant belongs to the grass family
why do you think the obesity is so high these days
last all the hard 
to whom it concern computers can be a great asset to our society but they are an even bigger hindrance
the butterfly starts it’s life in an egg
i was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online
but if people got off the computers and traveled and enjoyed nature they would be able to live it not just see a picture
race and origin are another problem with some people
this shows how the author is very proud
everyone knows computers addictive
compare a person with a laptop to one without
luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well
without this coordination people would not survive
another reason why i believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books we would never learn from terrible mistakes
although i see why some people oppose to computer i completely and utterly disagree
before computers you learned about things from books and many of those books could not teach you as well as a computer does
you work out your arms  your legs
a library wont immediately buy new books about it
computers also benefit our society because they are like big cellphones with a huge keyboard
that is about all i have to say on the topic
there are many reasons to support this but here are three
thanks to computers there is a great chance students receive a passing grade
how could anyone expect us to see our family in friends if there is no webcam
some of us swam and dived in the cold water
i thought everyone was treated by equal rights
henceforth i believe that computers serve a positive advancement in technology and its effect on people are rather great
the first reasons is when in your school you have homework work project or something like that the computer help you a lot
they give him determination because each horizon he sees gives him hope
well that brings me to my next point
he helps my mother with household chores
i understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy loving content mood
everyone had their own right to get and see the things they want
some were sitting on the benches
the author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this
one incident of my childhood is indelibly printed in my mind
this technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public
you can even a computer so you can video chat and not have to wait to get your reply
dear you know becoming reaching not only are computers are very helpful machines
closer families also help children in school get better grades
almost everyone has a movie they would like to see or a book they would like to read
he keeps the school notice board uptodate
lastly this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways
and each of those people that removed a book most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive
you could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog and or play over a friends house
lots of people like to make a big deal out of nothing
certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public
there are many things people see hear and read about that be offensive
then you would need to trace around everywhere to find a book
kids today need to spend more time outside then playing games on the computer
same way with the media
all of these are easily accessible by children of all ages
they are all happy because they can be together and have a grate time
what is offensive to you
to the story and goo continue ties reads
another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book they want to try and experiment with drugs themselves
you can send them all emails in under a few minutes
the computer are the best system for go online every body use computer
you can chat with them pictures of how there doing
i agree with and say that computers are good use in society today
if the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade he would have been fine
when i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it
by playing games  we can use what we learn in real life
a way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf
have you looked outside lately
finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated
did you know that information on the internet is wrong
well some libraries want to take that concept away
for me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book
they can change all they want but in the end it still happened
all my friends were also invited
the conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up
she fails her drivers test and is very upset
the books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday
it is a place filled with knowledge and information
censorship given by the parents or guardians is the best way to view censorship
as my teacher read us this book everyday we all sat and listened taciturnly
i go to school daily by bicycle
even though they first came to the 
the feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist
i think that computers teach you more than they disable you
to begin when someone is talking to another on a computer they never know who is at the other end of it
computers have a positive influence on people
those are my reasons now let me explain them
children spend most of their time on games than studying
should materials that are offensive be taken off shelvesshould movies you loved and use to watch when you were a kid be gone in a instant
he is the captain of our cricket team
music should stay on the radio or in stores not in libraries
getting rid of material is not the answer
have you ever heard of a email
missing a dictionary
i believe that this technology is a great help to society today
this is why the mood of the story is happy
there always controversy in our society and almost everyone loves it
the library is a place for everyone and not just one type of people
as my mother had said i remembered everything
and so your friends notice wonder
how do you determine what should be censored
if it was to happen to one business then it should happen to every business and in my perspective
do you like going on the computer
i say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless
the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist
we have a live chat on or even 
frequently during conversations without a computer nearby the mind is focused on something from earlier that day
a different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story
in addition books help you get more accurate facts
what is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another
most people in the have at least one and the number grows still
why a laptop of course
if they find material they do not want their children to read then they should censor in the home
some material be appropriate for children but they also are all inappropriate
people that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record
pleases near my reasons and give me a fighting chance
the line is that computers are very helpful
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
the materials be controversial but they still are pieces of literature that deserve to be read and studied by the people of the 
dear newspaper computers today have a negative effect on people
finally computers teach balance
the main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water
you use your computer to anything like this
do you think that books music movies magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored
did you know that of electricity in goes to computer
by doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person
some computers cost a lot money like  or and even more than  or it depend witch one they get
a few months ago i spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours
if children watch a scary movie then nightmares seem to occur more often
trees are very useful to man
the author says almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar
i believe computers are very useful to everyone
students usually have to do projects on places in the world and the computer is the main source of intelligence
in the morning when he began his trip he was eager and determined to get to his destination
as the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts
the computer helps the world
the mood of this story is very weird
such items can include music books and movies but i am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue
i think library censorship is not a good idea
how great is that
one can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language
some people abuse these rights and people get in trouble
lastly to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me
could you imagine life without computers
as she was having tea with him the kids came crowding in
this is where censorship comes into play
people lived in the middle ages without computers but with books
they never can do anything like going outside and doing sports
i get so engrossed in the book that i often to eat
the kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour
some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing
my dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him
while there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure
in my opinion they should not censor books
while some of it is not appropriate other parts of it guide us
computers play a major part in destroying our health
in all honesty yes let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting
the time to start limiting computer usage is now or we will have many great problems
a lot of teenagers and adults have because it gets
in conclusion those were the reasons why i think computers has a positive effect on people
make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely
therefore i urge you to not use computers
no one can stop them
no one puts a gun to our head and says  this book or you will die
it was here where i learned the real definition of family meaning his mood was he felt loved by his family
there is so much to learn on a computer
many of the parents do not want there kids to be seeing bad pictures or to check out bad movies or books
quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures you race down the hallway to a different section
so in conclusion i believe that computers are good use
we teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs
she was really upset
our views be different but we have similar needs
she wanted to make the best of things with what she had
get new friends from anywhere in the world
do you still support these computers
what would be put in there places
dear local news paper computers are powerful machines in our world
this means that years from now the world addiction to computers could be at or greater
when you are out of energy your ride is over
i read about the delicious food and rich culture
no they not use computers more
if he had some water he would not have thought this
computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages
take a stand and censor those books
there are many different programmes every day on television
taking there hard work off the shelves because some little thing offends someone is not fair to them
to talk to our friends or even to talk to other people in the world
the created by the author of the memoir is warm and inviting
i believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want books are made to be read and looked at
the author is explaining how their house was always open to anyone that ever needed all wanted to come which is a very welcoming feeling
when people come and search for a book to read they search for what they think they will enjoy
but when you stop all of a sudden you played for hours
when we saw each other at school we found hard to carry a conversation and took some getting used to talking face to face again
so whatever a kid reads or watches will probably be the same
that is the top secret of the happy life of my home
rated stands for sexual act language and blood
censorship in libraries is good in some ways
censorship should be allowed to an extent
dear  people these days rely too much on technology
she then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood
if he would have been bitten he would have died
so what do they do
i was typing like a pro
in conclusion i think that books should be censored by parents and that is it
we need to preserve through every problem we go through in life
whose to judge right and wrong for anyone
for instance the man drank so much water he almost ran out the water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave
now i am going to tell you how everyone has computers
we live in a place with the freedom of speech but yet that right seems to be fading away
i love him a lot and he is my greatest strength
in the article do not exceed the posted speed limit the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways
another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers
go and talk to them in real life
the of has been known as a classic since it was written
and i truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across has something to do with it all
one reason why i agree is because sometimes theirs teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they cant contact them in any other way
since you are sitting not doing anything else you start to eat a lot of snacks
this article deeply offended me but i am glad i read it and saw a different point of view
in conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist
so society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not
in this writing my goal was accomplished i wanted to let everyone know that the whole thing is getting a little out of hand
i get so frustrated that i hardly take bath or eat breakfast
plus websites and some applications are dangerous
this language is damaging how kids read and write
dear newspaper has an essay due on plants for science tomorrow
no one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read
i can see those anytime around town
this extends your friend ships with people
the next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other
some middle school through college  the rest of you life need to use computers
so the time has come to make a let your kid be lazy on the computer and get into or go have fun with them
last up can talk online
when you live as a computer vegetable your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be
my father had some urgent business at jaipur
protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parents concerns
poisonous snakes mirages rolling hills and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all
this website lets people upload videos
she ends with that paragraph because it starts over
they would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books
she is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower
in the essay it states wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke
the world cannot afford to censor
introducing computers could mess up that fact even more
with censorship we eliminate such problems
he also misbehaves in school constantly
how can you determine if something is offensive
lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults
the world is just a click away
every wants to get their extra weight off but they can because the want to check website or talk to their friends
i think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us
depending on the person some books be offensive to some but not all
the computers tell us how the war is and about what the president is doing
the first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump  old shed
we never all like the same thing
it is a very bad thing to have at a public place and that should not be aloud
one might argue the fact that it uses an offensive n word more than a few times
but now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad
i think computers have a positive effect on people
without computers students would have it a lot worse
this explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around because there was nothing out there to at
there are many which includes religious beliefs having independence and experimenting
then parents could be happy if there little boy or girl could only read certain books because of how old they are
also he is in the middle of the desert  where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way
some might not be appropriate for young children to read
if you plan to go to the movies tonight the internet will surely give you movie times directions and how long the movie will be
what things are found in libraries
they just need to be move to a shelf were only bigger kids can get to
should not be changed is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio
if you need to know state capitals you can find it in no time
information in libraries should not be censored even if the information is considered offensive
also you can shop its a birth day of you can get gifts for a very low price ever 
is very important to have interactions with people
the only thing would be is to keep an eye out for any offensive books music and etc
 i would like to tell you computers are very helpful in our society today
is this good or bad
that is the mood of the memoir throughout the whole passage
even if they are offensive they can teach young teenagers about their past
the lack of water really affected the cyclist
finally my last reason for why offensive material should not be removed is because who is to say whether or not something is offensive
although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be
even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year
as much as i would like to just to prevent others from reading it i cannot
but i thought it was great how he never gave up 
computers are helpful to us by doing work that has to be done neatly
we can also use computers
to end this story my reason was yo can find stuff online my second reason was you can have fun
spring is a symbol of fresh start
not two miles into the next section of the ride i noticed the terrain changing reveals the cyclist
i think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad
the plant and the geese represent symbols to her
there are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject
i believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf
now your not bored anymore
but mostly the author was grateful
should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive
she had bought hibiscus as a comfort to herself
if so then maybe we should something
thank you for deeply considering all the arguments that i have to offer
computers teaches kids new things
thank you for your time
people have there own choice on what they want to read  watchor listen to
they want a change so you can enjoy life again
email is something that there are so many new ides
they had left their whole family behind
so instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in
some restrict their child from such material but i would call that depriving a child of there freedom
there is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line
i know i said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this
libraries who have offensive books are not trying to offend anyone in anyway they are on the shelves for the education of the reader or viewer
explain things to them when they ask you a question
if someone is making a project at a school
depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events which you cannot find books at the library
plus computers give children enjoyment and make them happy instead of being sometimes
you could even play hide and seek with your friends even tag
earlier in the story she says that she failed the test because she did not impress her mom
then the girl went missing for about weeks
memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test
and because he was in the desert there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type
while at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended
dear  i am expressing my concern to you about the side effect new technologies such as computers have an humans
the cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men
i think that because people should be having fun socializing with people and living there life
on the other hand the computer does have cons
our school library is having books which i like very much
all these things can be helpful and all you have to do is take in it and take advantage of free information that is given to you
if we take action rashly or foolishly it may ruin us
all of this teaches me to be more careful about what i am doing and where i am doing it at
online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give 
in the wide open desert the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles
i personally have never been to a library and saw a book magazine movie song that was offensive to me or my family
my class teacher is very nice and polite
many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives
if the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances
the features of a setting could be a number of different things
you could look it up and find out what the park has to offer
i can say i am in to abnormal stories
it is also important to that they can keep in touch with friends after school hours
we check news on computers some people even use their computers a and watch important shows
when i am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion i would be concerned
in our library we have this section
people believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about
this number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer
this is how the setting affected the rider
they bring us information at amazing speeds
if people did not have a library they not be able to research a paper or something else that they need to get finished
of people say they learn social on the computer
our body gets ultraviolet and infrared treatment from sunlight
she had taken the test and failed living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her
i could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin or another kid from a different country
you can even buy the game systems
i know that i enjoy downloading music too so why should it be any different for other people
computers have been used for decades and i think they will be used for many many more
by censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author right to speak
they are required by some to enjoy a good book
who knows what you can learn
computer helps the world in many ways
nature is very important and can be extremely fun so this is a shame
get on a computer and do some research about it
for kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy
the text says no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
our country  say that everyone has the right to free speech
these types of things i think should be taken off the shelves everywhere
so take them off the radio
we do have books here that are kept behind the librarians desk that if you really wanted to read that book its behind her desk
they need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books
based on the memoir the mood created by the author in the memoir was filled with lots of love and satisfaction
you get offended and complain
computers stop us from exercising interacting with nature and being with our families
if everyone was to ban one book they found offensive the world would be without any books and become quite dull
for example i learned how to type rapidly on a keyboard from a computer on a game called type to learn
what is censorship
plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty
the answer is no just let it be
the last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight
some people might even find this paper offensive
people are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market
i will help any kid as much as i can with there dreams
lets say you have a history report the tomorrow you forgot your history book at school and you know nothing about the report
or how they see the actors in the movie and they curse and they think is cool cause there doing it as well
so thing can happen if you do the wrong stuff
we are indebted to our soldiers for their noble servicewe must always respect our soldiers and encourage them
if you think it might be offensive to you then set it back on the shelf
the cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water but also the scorching heat of the desert
the internet also is a valuable research tool
most of these victims do not return or are found
he begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him
families now a days are being broken up due to computers
the first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to
when we walk along the road we meet many of them
if it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it my dad would have had a little chat with that library
one person look upon a certain subject as offensive while others not have the same point of view
everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight
it gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there
to learn about these ideas you usually read about or see them somewhere
next computers allow easy access to the news and online textbooks
plus you could get at places for working with computers you could make programs and anything you would want
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
first of all i think that computers benefit our society because lets people in contract with family and friends in other states
one of them is 
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
thank god he had a computer because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends
when you sit in front of a computer your eyes are on the screen
this effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy
lastly the school will not have enough money for materials
you can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding
if someone steadily talks about you or on a daily basis offends you people can get depressed
without any of these enjoyments what would people do with their free time
now a days friends aim video chat or text each other instead of going and doing something with them
my last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home
i will be talking about how computers give people good typing skills how they give information to people and how they allow us to socialize
in this case the authors message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things
first off online websites have many different ways to contact people chat rooms blogs email etc
he never used a computer
thank you for taking your time to ready what i really think about removing articles from libraries
an enormous part who your child become  the values they hold is a product what they were exposed to a young age
magazines have certain articles that are racist and certain articles that are very offensive to certain religions
turns out i was fine
music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored
computers are not having a negative affect on society
the author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph 
therefore the nature of where his bike passed and the things he saw affected his choices and ability
then no one should
computers make interacting with other people in person a lot more difficult
so you do
books music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone
talking to family and friends without spending money
he is a very nice man
the censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything they just sat at home and watched the television all day
she plans on passing her driving test come spring no matter what
computers cost a lot of many but it is worth it
this can be a serious problem
no one should be aloud to take something away that is important to other people even if it is offensive
i would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere but it could educate people on what and what not to do
i feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer
another thing is the lifestyle
computers have a amount of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things
the person should just not read the book
dear  computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people
high school student
said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it
in we practice freedom of speech
no individual can say that material is not suited for the public because they are not the public
did you know that four out of five households have a computer
there are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed
at times of war they are the first ones to come forward and fight for the country
they either put a person down and be completely negative towards them or they are positive and say nothing but good about them
they just think think my way is the right way and the only way
my thirdly reason is how to search on google or the 
plus people need family
times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids you can start a pick of game of baseball
we then had our dinner
would it be amazing if you could just find a recipe go to
it helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on
i go to my page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as i send to my friend in 
the real world is not censored so books should not be either
dear  more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
that is in my opinion the beauty of human nature
i love mommy
did you know that of homes in own at least one computer
dear newspaper  people in our community use computers for positive ideas
people need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not
a big question i ask is why
in conclusion libraries should have respect not only for people but for the materials they have
the of this story is that happiness can be created and kept in one place
i know i do
humans have different taste in food music movies and books
think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored
because it is true
you can to other people that are or you can just on some websites such as   and tons more
computers are just amazing
perfect democracy can be achieved by educating all people in a country
it usually does it in the morning when the first rays of the sun appear
therefore i encourage you to support computers because they are so useful and valuable
the cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak
computers help people know news traffic weather directly interact with people and learn new things
the pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst
and who knows they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak
ultimately libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society
i believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only
most of our daily homework is on the computer
what do you do
then she enquired about the reason
right off the bat i can think of many offensive or inappropriate books movies songs and magazines
if everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left
i know this from personal experience
very soon he anger goes with the wind and sprang up to her usual kindness
but what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world
you should always think things out before you take action just to be safe
i have a friend name  and she is a computer addict
now music and movies etc
throughout the entire year i video chat with her through computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there
and then there is the content of what you are viewing
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
computers do benefit society
woman and are the same no matter what people say
in that part i can tell that she is already starting to change
i agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things from all libraries
speech is still a freedom though and if we cut out freedom we would be in a bad spot
at night he sleeps in the stable with other horses
one way is we can find closest gyms on the internet
i like fiction stories then nonfiction
i know a lot of people who love it though
when people take these things harmful they are not getting the true meaning that the author had in mind when the wrote them
this can bring you closer to the people you love and help them get to know you a little better
when you research online the information literally comes to you
it made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through
the conditions of the road made it harder first he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill
image is the key to how people view society today
second of all computers people to talk to other people around the world
it wouldn be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way i am
a third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online
many lazy people like to put things on hold
plus websites are filled with viruses and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project
a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
my last and strongest reason that technology can help you find anything in everyday life
if it is rated then i know that i see some blood gory scenes and nudity
we want to good guys to win
it was hard for them but they got by and did a great job
the world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone
my answer to you is to not just throw everything out that be offensive or that you might not want your child to see
for instance when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out
are many different types of books and music out and censoring these would greatly limit the variety
spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising
my last reason is because on a computer you pretty much look for anything
it also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often
throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents
after all i am the parent right
the reader then might want to read her next piece of work
i do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library
he used to be a student
first i will be talking about how people use computer too much
also they taught him to be selfless
i still get my exercise though because i go out and play basketball then play on my computer
what is your vision on computers today
as more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair
libraries have books that spark interest in a reader
magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out
the winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home
which leads to eventually promote death
they might be paying a bill by the computer
there are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship
an ideal student should have many qualities
dear  you know that out of students in grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family
do you ever find it easier to talk to someone on the computer than it is in person
and he appreciates that more than anything
censoring or removing on the other hand is permitted to the distributor
but this does not mean that that work should be banned
then maybe the library should consider removing the item
after several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it they finally had him talked into it
they want all the guys to stair
even the bird seasons would be back like always
the author concludes the story with that like to leave the reader guessing
also attraction to literature would seize
libraries should have music that encourage you to go out and be something in life
these are my three reasons on why i think computers have a positive effect on people
getting rid of the material is not what should be done
anything else should be open to all ages
but they all did also agree on the fact that they really do not have the right to remove them from the shelves
reason three your health is in jeopardy
even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay
are you hearing this from your children than usual
every work would be remove because at least one person is offended every work of the sort
around the cyclist was deserts and more empty towns
he was pulled into our boat
authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like
because or she finds it offensive
some kids have their education online or to teach others
dear of my local newspaper more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
i believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back
the mood is a very happy one
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
but really if you think about it its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about
the mood created by the author is happy and grateful towards his parents
i think this because if you put into context the word test it could mean many things
libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change
what you a room notebooks that you buy of or a single computer with tons of space and back up
so when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward
so then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so i could talk to her
the author is thanking his parents for the numerous amount of things they have done for him he is grateful
it should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it
instead of sitting on the computer for an hour you could be getting your hour of exercise
every minute you are on the computer you can learn something new
should be removed from the shelves
therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in
do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over 
for a school project or just for fun
the more time we spend using these items the more we oppose the idea of being active
each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in
now its your turn to jump on out of virtual world and put your head back in reality
because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers
going on the computer is much easier
with computers you store all and files neatly
this idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home
the invention computers has made it easier to catch up with family
she knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant that she will pass the test
when i walk into a library to look for a book i would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books movies or magazines
take i for an example
all of us began repeating it
to begin with the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems
another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long
being one that reads a lot i know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book
there is a great rush at the doors of the compartments
out of people work out home
lastly the use of computer puts a strains on social skills between friends and family
keep or remove
the story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her home where she no longer lived
if some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them
in the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water
any question including personal anything can be answered
the mood that is created by this story is admiration
the world would be a much different place without computers
dear editor of the 
taking advice from a group of old men he headed to his first stop
in my opinion i say that  computers do have and effect on us but a good reason
not to mention you can go with a family friend of even be tutored
from personal experience i can back this statement up with books i have read going through my school career
you can be alone on the computer in a dark room
i think these should be a limit on a computer so people spend less time on the computer and more exercising
in the every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to
away computers helping our economy is instead of people driving to go pay there bills they could pay online
there are some materials in a library though that could be offensive
in the computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations
making the choice to go into a library is an individuals decision
if anything i am trying to help me and my fellow citizens
this is something you can not change
the social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social
they can have devastating influence no supremacy what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort
he praises the good work done very by them
people should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries
i feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off
one thing that i find very useful on computers is an online textbook
most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader
with different personalities comes different writers
i am a really smart kid
as an using as well in school
having a computer is mandatory for school
the listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves
most of the time when people go to a library they go to get books
many people might say we could all just write it out
in the end my father agreed
if you miss someone or you just want to talk there is websites that let you do that
do you man out of people have 
i know this because of the sign that he saw that said rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed 
another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online
many things about the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist
from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles
computer change not only the body but mind
everybody has their on opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want
this shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that
i think the only real people that can remove a book for the shelves is the managers or manager if they agree with the patron
do it to learn it sit at a computer website to hire someone
must be getting offended much more easily these days because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been
what do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet
every year thousands of new books are introduced to the public
the child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem
in the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life
many times i have learned new things from books that not have been appropriate for my age but it taught me a valuable lesson
if there is snow on the ground and people are unable to get their newspaper they can read it online
computer are also great because you can video chat with friends and family
you should be able to have freedom without removing anything from anyone
people getting caught up on the  or people not having enough money to explore the world so they just be on the 
i am going to tell you what i think about the books movies and magazines
he is agitated by this makes a significant dent in his water supply and unfortunately continues
this is the mood created by the author in the memoir
like computers sometimes keep kids out of the street so they wont get in trouble
a can cost anywhere from to even that is a ton money
i was missing out on a lot of things
he respects all his elders
if your ever trouble on something you could always look up information about it
short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain
we learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed
i think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again
another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story
the word conformism means to all become one to conform
finally i would like to tell you about the cruise ships you can go far away like    and many more
of use their computers to talk with others online
most my extended family lives in 
people will spend less time exercising less time outdoors enjoying nature and less time interacting with family and friends
along with the hibiscus it also shows that the geese and the melting of the snow represent a fresh start and a new beginning 
the author created a mood of immense gratefulness
so many people are addicted to it
there are many others
this advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue is that really bad
he weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
in addition a big factor of and is music
computers can do more harm than good
this paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the united states instead of her home
for many families though the series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world
so many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong
another thing is the land
by doing this they try and get it to be published and put in stores so people can buy it
the author explains were he lived as a child very vividly
the author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir
the paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent
this way people can know what to expect if they read 
today the world works by  as grow
the firemen fought the flames bravely
i took a tally and out of every kids use the internet at least once a day
the reason why i think computers are good is because people like to do their work or children likes the games on the computers
the author is very grateful for all that his parents did for him
dear  people are using too much their time on the computer
i know this because talks about his family and friends and his 
what would this world be with no computers
my second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other
the features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder
day was in the library with the rest his class assigned to researching his topic in a book
that is why i say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist
and also the home bringing the family closer together
now days people can get offended over anything
censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass
from the authors tone it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist
depending on where you are the restrictions be more or less harsh
i tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color
an artist or songwriter will write rap and sing songs about what they want
he wears a simple life

not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history
in conclusion libraries are a good source of information
we can enjoy food work hard to have sound sleep and can find happiness in our life
maybe some others do like them and like to read them

that being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework
no is not true just listen to the reasons why in a computer you can find people that your looking for
i think that the books movies magazines etc
i think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up
there are other types of library items in the library that could be censored
when you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late
so he had to be really hot
parents are advice and to be acknowledge what their kids are seeing

another reason why computers are a big help because you can stay in touch with friends and family
i have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight
the most well behaved neat and punctual student is awarded a prize at the annual day function
but as mentioned earlier censorship should only be to a certain degree
removing material from the shelves make some people happy but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable
since computers are used daily especially by young adolescents it is likely for that child to become obese
they love to eat sugarcanes
books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library
second the material can speak of the race as if was bad

without those books in that library i would have never been able to research those topics
the classrooms are large
in society no matter what the topic is there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it
some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink
we live in a very diverse world they are going to be different outlooks on the world
the computer is an easy convenient way to get information
then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about
this also could show that it is hot because he thinks its a mirage and people usually see them in the desert where it is hot
i not have children but i do have younger cousins
so i think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or who ever do
a library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted
the conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him
this is show when he says
these books should be kept far away from are children
finally computers are great to communicate with people far away
so whats the point
talking with others by computers makes the world go round
first off one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact
this quote shows that he is happy
it holds tons of great information
after that website you could go out and get the you will need
removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people solutions to problems

you go to a library to read books music and magazines but soon you find out that there are very offensive books
what can be done about this problem
some people need computers
there is a variety of materials available to the public that be offensive to some especially to their little children
books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published
when he says the sun was beating on me this shows it was hot
later these children will be able to chose for themselves they think is acceptable and the censorship can end
it could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more
they should stay away from computer for a time
finally they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship
that way friendships are never really lost
i do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and find different types of work offensive
next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery
in the story rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist
does your neighborhood seem to be locking children
i know that of the population of the  prefer computer sources over book sources because computers are so much easier when it comes to finding specific information
first and foremost computers allow people to talk to friends and family
so unless you want all those things happening to you i suggest you spend less those on the computer
the house was decorated with streamers and balloons
the settings effect the cyclist tremendously
i also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new technology
the features of the setting or environment in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him
the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated but the man is alone in the desert
the mood created by the author is happy
ordering clothes books movies tickets for trips and more all can be done online
the reasons why i agree with computers have benefits is that
music is a different story however
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills this characteristic is a setting like the others negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder
a library is a public library just like the internet is public too
family members always around visiting frequently for dinner
this can later help you in sports when you get out and exercise
these are only some things i can do on my computer
why should it change now
if they start taking out big parts of history it will be long lost and forgotten
you can go on the internet play games and even talk with people
but with new computers they strive to meet every goal
listen to the music you like watch the movies you like and read the books and magazines you enjoy
most of the students take their lunch boxes and sit in the playground
should there be computers in are society
cultures come in a variety we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home
some people say that computers enable internet conversations between friends and computers pass off information about faraway places and people
computers keep lots of kids of the streets instead of being out and causing trouble
she opened her laptop and found where her kid was
my three reasons are to look up information homework and talking online to friends and family
whether it be in writing singing or pictures you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate
allowing that music or movie or book to be made and then take it away is ridiculous
the elephant saluted the people with its trunk
also books pertaining to racism such as to a and books about slaves be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book
with the social networking sites everyone is receiving tons of about one another

a couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days
nothing at all
this would be useful for a school project on a country
in the the people are given many rights that are often taken for granted
that is what computers were made for
it informed people of what was going on
next there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast
i even became friends with them
censorship or the ability to control what is seen or heard is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next
lastly the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them
the railway station presents an interesting scene
this is why all items need to be available to the public
some people want to read or watch something with such content
a library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose
to prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it
i encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life
the government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in 
but now with a computer all that can change
many people including parents have used the computer to look and read into about other countries
then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were
have you ever heard of 
so now think would you want to be lonely overweight and deprived of nature
setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone
we need to go outside and exercise
i prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative
although some computers be fairly easy to use companies are constantly trying to increase the difficulty of computers
this makes the author need more water than he normally would

no matter who believes what or who supports who everyone will always have a difference in voice
they wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life
books should be removed only if they are found a certain degree of offensive
i agree with the censorship in libraries today
however on the way there he had to cross through a desert like terrain
since the is a public place and people can not just throw away a book because that is offensive
for example is an author who has been challenged throughout her entire career
libraries contain many helpful and entertaining materials for people of all ages
books are always there for us when we are bored lonely or just want to escape reality
materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive
will a parent let a year old read a smut novel
but they did not think of the fatigue or hot sun
he works hard and loves his work
in libraries is censorship truly needed

by doing this he expects a better
this words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself almost familiar to her now

not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions however that is what makes our world so individualized
what do   and all have in common
he teaches many classes
certain books provide an escape for some teens and even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives
in this environment everything looks the same for miles
the water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more
are many different views on censorship which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries
this quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all
in my opinion books that seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf
in this case the author wanted to express joy in her writing
i am writing you because i am concerned with the health of the town
a curse word a bit of skin a controversial idea
how would you do it
they where also lucky that they where going to have a better life
so being on the computer does not make you smarter
the economy is bad enough the way it is
we should do thorough calculations and also we should do a thorough survey

with five kids and one laptop who would want to be happy
for example some adult books etc
just as they are today in our local library
i believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends

according to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist
the computer teaches you things for life
so authors have freedom to write what they would like to
also everyone today listens to music
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important
computers are just plain bad
sure they can mail it out but that would take forever for people to find out about it and learn about it
it makes them feel good
computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work
but i still exercise daily
we should be able to get the books that we like from libraries
trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
once i actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this i thought that it was a good idea
although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale but censorship is censorship
meanwhile whether or not i prefer or differ readings of all types i despise of any negative books
for example they show things about mythology for making a pat
they are good because you can learn things educational
that is the family love i am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family
the authors gave the decision to choice between books or items
in the memoir there is more the one mood but this is the main one
the cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town
this essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone
for example in paragraph  he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child
if the parent chooses to limit access then they should be active in the process of selection
for example and that rich sweet scent that was familiar ton
this proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him
the reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands
it has a very grand and imposing building
dear newspaper  even though there are good effects of computers on people there are also many bad effects
this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them
this greatly affects his family
the movie industry for example
two new websites have been made and people want to see how works

it allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves
removing books magazines and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful empty library
we could only assume
the possibility of heatstroke came to mind
another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen
if books are being taken of shelves based on a few people opinions then their rights are being infringed upon by the people who deemed it inappropriate
the quotation  all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
some good effects some harsh effects
in every book you pick up today you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it
and without a computer all that would be very challenging
we should never give up
there are many forms of music

maybe because of some important information they might need for an assignment from a teacher

i do think in some cases then they should have to say why they want that certain material just to determine it is for all the right reasons
overall computers are that make life that much more stressful
knowledge no matter the content is valuable
i bet that if computers were taken away for year then the changes in health would be drastic
no buildings are around the cyclist
typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs
computers are an amazing way to meat new pol online
the author also writes
nowadays computers have a major chance to do that to you
all right so computers are one of the most important tools of this world that we live in today

i disagree with that opinion

everyone who goes to a library should have everything to there needs
their home was almost a sanctuary
most people use these web pages to research for papers trips or even just to find out random information
one of my good friends is years old has two jobs her own apartment with her boyfriend and is not supported by either of her parents
books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by parents

the first reason is that what maybe offensive to you not be to someone else
the mood of this memoir is happiness
that could be a hobby for adults that does not have something to do could have a good time

they help with school work provide east communication and provide safe educational activities you can see computers are a great addition to our world
the charges are not very high
not everything is decided by me
you ask yourself the answer is simply that the is too expansive and distracting
imagine the impact if the had locked away every copy of the because it brought about change and controversy
computers effect a lot of people
why take the risk when you can just use a phone
not at all
not only is a computer good for communication but you can also play fun and entertaining games

my response is that you just could email it to a teach friend or any body else
if some people get offended or think they get offended by something they would try to removed whatever it was from the nations stores
this is why i think that people are spending ton much time on computers
i believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this
a bad part about the internet is chat rooms if you talk to the wrong people then you can be in trouble
so we can prove that computers are good for motor skills school work and even social networking

you have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear see and or do
it just depends how sensitive people are
another example is that in school kids have a choice of what electives the want to take

if you like to read then check online these be a book you enjoy free of charge to read
time limits can fix this problem
you can chat with them
the mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one
they promote learning coordination and even general welfare
it is a good way for people to get to know you
same with the magazines movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library
she is reminded of her home by these flowers and she has with this she can retake it and do it rite
i believe that the mood created by the author is happy and loving
every man has own likes and dislikes
if you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems
these are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong
one reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated
government has to keep an eye on the unemployed and to keep their numbers down
i feel as we are letting kids these days do as they feel and do what ever they want
religion is one thing that history books can really raise offense to people because it could have some of the facts wrong about that type of religion
there are many reasons why offensive materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries stores and everywhere else
some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other
the fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce
children learn about drugs in movies books and can hear about them in music
using computers people can learn about new places and things whenever they want
for example if a child go to library they see a movie that contains sexual activity and decided to check the movie out
dear local newspaper computers have a lot of affects on people
more computer means lack of exercise and social interaction you can easily be addicted and you can lose your sense of realness
no one wants to be ignorant right
she takes us to school and brings back from the school
what i think offensive when something removed off shelves
should certain materials be removed from shelves
as i mentioned before the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa
through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones
another way you could too a is from online classes
this profession is for those who have the perception to resolve the problem of any situation
some people find the books offensive while others not
i mean his house was a peaceful and a safe place
my second reason why is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want
everything is for educational purposes
because of the lack of water not only might be die but he begins to see mirages
a sense of relief came to him like that shop was his safe haven
everyone cannot be the same it just would not work
the most beautiful part of its body is the long tail
i firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer without knowing how long has gone by
the author is grateful for the things parents did for him so he could get a better life
i think if you are reading or watching it then it is at your own fault if you are offended by it
there were great hustle and bustle in the markets
he needs to use more energy to get over the hills
she wants to try again her test
so many are kidnapped because online chatting
all those statements help backup why the author might leave such powerful paragraph for last
they hit the ball hard from their side to the side of the rivals
the plants are losing there leaves
he began to ride again
they give you access to an amazing amount of information
if the books were meant to be read that way then so be it
in the memoir he grew up in a kitchen full of people who taught him to love cooking
these are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book magazine or even a song
my dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music
that is why i think that computer can answer your questions
i personally think that if people could do that they would but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you
the music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular
when he see the first comp he is overwhelmed with relief and the terrain flattens out again
it is time for our society to stop being nurtured by the government and start doing our own dirty laundry
but i still think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say
that of people benefit from using the computer
when in the desert one must keep cool or perish
 and other magazines like it needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible
obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself
here the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both form the backdrop to life in a warm home
the library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker
the first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert
they also search for addressed and phone number
how cool would that be
i think we should have more time outside
because they are all ways to express ourselves
of the human population spends up to an average of two hours on a computer each day
they even miss out on just going outside and talking a walk the reason is because they are inside their house with their fare glued to the computer
this illustrates that computers must have an positive effect on people if most people own them
example even grandma have and she talks online with her family members
but every one is created the same so treat people the way you wont to be treated
however thank you for reading
not only are there websites
also when you learn about something
other material that could be offensive could not only be to children it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well
so you imagine a world controlled by computers
in my opinion the citizens of would want to keep it more clean and be more about their
the author further emphasizes the mood by using words like aromas passionate
when children go to a library usually they will not do so alone
and throughout the memoir there is a constant mood which is happiness
in our hamlet things are quite different
third reason every could be offense to somebody
three examples show that family is the most important thing
is time flying you by
i rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face
for family who live far away and online is the only way to socialize online interaction is a great thing to have
first and most importantly he is affected by the people who live there

students like myself of often use computers for many reasons
local libraries are a very nice place to go for books movies and information
inappropriate magazines in the reach of children

it is our duty to cooperate with him
getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with samples
you can run a business from your very own living room
also explains about his community and the diversity there
do not censor what libraries put out such as books music movies and magazines
computers encourage kids not to study or do homework
can you imagine how difficult life would be without a computer
the content of what goes into a book is up to the author
there was a large crowd of people outside the gate
you can find your favorite song for your cellphone
every book that has ever been written has effect someone either in a good way or a bad way
hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball
being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the to write
my friend likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts
my brother’s name is oliver
the government has given people freedoms
the persons health their the users well being
the internet can quickly and directly answer your questions
also the mood of this story is very loving
dear  some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time
i can and will say i experimented with life
the unity that the neighborhood has formed
this not seem like much but on the battle field it can make the difference between life on death
their are good and bad books but that all depends on the opinion of the reader
there is no way to get those back either
magazines could be offensive by the words used such as slang words cursing words and violent words
i went by bus
others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer and not exercising
all however betray a sense of fear in their content and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization
a conducting experiment that are rigged
for me i like to learn a bout crocodiles in 
in paragraph  the author says how he will always be grateful for his parents and the life that they gave him
outside it was warm and sunny
dear newspaper i thought that i should express my concern
these are real time
is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries
computers are a great way to keep connected
another reason is because of communication
so can we come to an agreement life
it used to be that traveled very slowly  we can know about it only a few minutes after it happened thanks to computers
then the library has a bad image which is a big problem
the answer is computers
materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole
no one wants their library to be closed so libraries should not be censored
the whole range of knowledge is based on orderliness around us
she is willing to give the test another try and is sure to pass it
this is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest
he says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water
we need water for our daily activities like bathing cooking washing etc
how could you become physically fit
with a computer typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition
this allows you to type and sent emails faster
some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career
a obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go
with some computers you can even see and talk to any person you wish
they could be apart for months or even years
in fact religion might be the most important issue
typing to long or to much can cause your fingers to lock up and it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain
even i was done reading this it i thanked the lord for computer it helps us so much
all major corporations use computers to invest sell products and store information
i want my library to be what was made to be a mixture of cultures and backgrounds
that way more time can be spent outside in the open and less inside staring at the screen all day
instead of that people should be playing outside or going for a walk in the park
well they do
that line was from the last page of the story
and lastly they are the future of our world
for one the helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them
if they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them
but would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy
education is very important especially in our economy today
in fact they have done quite the opposite
owners can now have businesses all over the world
also think back to that baseball player
they have friends on but no friends in real life
it because of the pines that caused the road and the cool feel of the river
the influences one encounters can be either positive or negative
this shows that she really missed her home and she had nothing to give her confidence
finally in paragraph the author explains how he learned the true definition of family
like i am into all kind of sex books
well i would like to state my opinion if that is good with you
it is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason
the mood for his story is bittersweet
the geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same
the snow always melts when the seasons change
there can be men who say there and really be 
in conclusion all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended
simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun
lastly it can have you have a higher position at your job
do kids check these out
also i think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting
i remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now
he had once read that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate
security jobs bills school contacting games everything
people learn too much on it
you and i both know that every one needs a 
they also give the ability to learn about far away places
she is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test
every person has an opinion which is allowed to have by freedom
they can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to
from the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips
if you want to talk to your friends why not call them or more modernly text them
the computer lets us as students to broaden our horizon
that can usually take up a lot of peoples time
yes i agree with the concern that expert have
computers a topic if you ask me
musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people
as i stated in the first paragraph everyone has there own opinions
i think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the build for our children to read
this should be censored in libraries
some street hawkers carry their wares on a cycle or a handcart
computers are a quick and easy way to look up information for a school project or paper
on the internet you can connect and chat with friends
imagine that a person comes up to you and says  is that you are reading there
home interesting was it
well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier
he seemed unsure and a little nervous
many things talked about in the books are the same things talked about in the school hallways what is the difference
most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads watches or listens to be found offensive or crude to someone else
to we them because of that addicting computer
also shows things about your personal info
there are people that think there kids seeing bad things will make them want to do it
you can also learn how to type when you know how to type you can type faster and faster
he tells us plainly that he thanks his parents and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child
that be true but also remember what its doing for society
the computer can also be very dangerous in many ways
after reading rough road ahead do not exceed speed limit i noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator
computers are a great help for reports vacations chatting information to help you study for a test
so in a way the human race depends on technology actually we do depend on technology
the features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink
the parent in shock could sue the library for having such an offensive book
i have 
it is hot dry and deserted this out effects the main character and journey
this is why it is set too a sadly love mood
all of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff and its not a good thing
adults can eliminate it
for example the war in  or more recently the and earthquakes
now i will talk about some of the things that computers help out with in life
i find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book then someone from another country could read it
there are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever
however in the case of a school library all the books of course should be age appropriate
the mood of this memoir is nothing but good
suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf
going outside is better for you to
she would most likely need to go to the internet 
therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries
computers and almost everyday
even very little kids can play games
computers affect people in a positive way
the features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist
in basketball you should dribble and look ahead
here is another reason why the computer is great for society
everyone has opinions what would be left without books
there are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun
you have to type them too
libraries do you go to libraries
first the heat made the cyclist overheated
your honor i have my proof right here
she vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again
the scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned
this is just one reason why i think offensive distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the 
many a time she helps us in locating and selecting books
not everyone agrees with that
music is not just something you listen to but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book
also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that
because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world
say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you
you need to think of everybody not just yourself
he ran out of water not to for into his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in
this shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water
i remember one time long ago the only way to communicate was by letters or you would have to walk
this also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship the mood that the author set during the story was love
dear local newspaper i think computers are used way to much in this society
said  who destroys a good book kills reason itself
first reason for agreeing is because some books music movies magazines and etc
what will happen
they choose what child wears where they live and where they attend school
i know that most people in was spend all the time with there family
censorship in the world is getting worse everyday
kids are let onto computers every day and they wonder to the websites that the internet has to offer
the mood created in the memoir is grateful
i remember going to the library all the time when i was younger
they shoot you
do you have a computer
furthermore people can interact with friends over the computer
my second reason is because you can learn about far away places
they also have small teeth inside the mouth
censoring hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever
this means that even though there was segregation around them their neighborhood was still friendly
my last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive is originally from a computer
however yes i do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored
all big and small companies depend upon these agencies to catch the market for their products
also children do a lot of school work on the computer
or how about a new hat for your friend
the libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age
people should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day
if you have messy handwriting and its getting harder and harder for your teacher to read then you can just learn how to type it up on the computer
when the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope
she also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of home
managing a household is a big responsibility
it is our life
in conclusion computers have a very positive effect on people
for example here we learn and 
the author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home
camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends
then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding
with them when ever i want to
so for those reasons i think computers have a positive effect on people
there is also some videos that are rated    etc
also many more jobs want people with computer skills
to me computers are just a trouble in our lives
he thought i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
a major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors
kids should get off the computer and worry about school
mutual cooperation in students and sports and games raises the standard of a boarder
an example of the vastness of the park was when he quote about forty miles into the pedal i arrived at the first town
his parents left behind friends family and their good jobs to start anew in  also that he would live a better life than they
now that you have read my reasons i hope you like them
i understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future
chatting become something that almost of the uses
also content that is inappropriate for children be fine for adults to read
censorship is based off of offensiveness
well the internet does
you should always be thankful to you parents
libraries should or should not have books music magazines that are found offensive
the shelves would be bare
the features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time
he does grate in school too
and could have even died
finally is the structure first there was the ghost town with the battery acid tasting water
so just as she vows to take the test again shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong just as her winter hibiscus
throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others
you can playing games with people from ground the world
why should your opinion speak for everyone else
wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day
my first reason i believe computers are good to have around is
computers can give organize
online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others
some people prefer to write than type but other people prefer to type than write
my third reason was you can meet people
i really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like
yes due to the fact that some books are a little above others age of reading
the technology abilities help us with tasks every day
we have even reached the moon and left our 
sometimes you need a brake you cant stay on the computer all the time
if there was though they should just make an alternative section for books music movies and magazines that some people think should be put there
furthermore computers help people with work and school
but i think as much i did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall
the conditions for the cyclist in the story do not exceed posted speed limit are pretty dangerous
if it is music movies or magazines then it should be dealt with the same way
the main problem is water or lack there of
i know that some say that there is less time spent humanly interacting but on the computer it is still interacting
lots of people come to the library to check out books music  movies  and other things for entertainment
the mood the author created in the memoir is grateful
movies are a large portion of this problem but they are there do to entertainment reasons
the other day though i started thinking about it
computers are used world wide everyday and most of the time is used for a good reason
first off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means
lastly computers make life less stressful
the author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article
now a days nobody cares if materials are offensive just as long as they sell
did you agree
in the memoir he say that he would never forget how his parent turned his simple house into a home
only because the computer were going to crash and lose all the data that we have ever recorded
example on you find what ever street you want
i think most people would agree i say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same
time is a very important factor for us
there were also no people around to help him or give him water
setting standards on computers can improve this problems and help exercising
the rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist
i believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past
how will you keep up with your email or type of the articles for this very newspaper
some people are so obsessed they might even break down and have a fit
when she accomplishes this she is growing just like the hibiscus
whether we are learning about criminals racism or wars there is always going to be one person who is against it all
throughout my own experience i have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge
so i think next time shell do great
 studies have been conducted over the past few years and they show that people of all ages spend of their free time on the computers
soon the fire engine came
people who use the computer all day every day end becoming very lazy because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer
why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses
we must respect him
for her culinary love of food family and parent sacrifices will be forever grateful
after they had first moved to the they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play
in conclusion the mood to wards the article i think happens to be grateful
a life with out computers is a lot harder to do things that we cant make simpler with computers
you use a webcam and talk to anyone you want
secondly the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest
i did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs
when you are driving you need to be able to look up and still be able to steer the car
shows that loves his families cooking and his own
these ideas are the ones that keep society going making us think and helping to formulate our opinions
so watch what you put online there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted
the conditions affected the cyclist
also if i got kicked out of the library i would just go to another one
final reason is online dating
we need to inform our state about this problem
because i use them myself
we develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings
it all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in
since students rely on their computers so much then always on them
since global warming is a problem we can learn how o preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet
it just be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion
dear local newspaper technology is a ever evolving thing and more and more people are using it
you know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well
the setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story
also all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake  the rough road
this number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities lack of interest in education and lack of resources in the 
much can be done as regards prevention protection immunisation etc
dear local newspaper have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer
the text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies
do not let the world come to that
but is really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write
last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work
i would be two because sometimes a whole chapter could be bad or in music a whole lyric could be bad
in conclusion the water being bad the terrain change
 in and a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book
a computer also new friends from other towns
last sunday there was an accident near india gate
so he had to move around it
in conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful
some parents not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying
the reason i feel this way is a computer has google to make finding things easier
thirdly i believe computer is a positive effects far away relative
the setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much
then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information
in the text the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist
the ending also gave the most meaning
in fact out of people have been scammed some time in their life i can clearly remember when someone
the most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information
but there will always be someone who is unhappy
it can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere
of kids are overweight and that is unhealthy
i still feel frightened when i remember the accident
computers give exercise in a way it makes your fingers move faster
it is a gift of the nature
there is a great rush at the booking windows
and in his eyes his whole community was one big family
does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive then an item should be taken off shelves
that alone says how much love there was in the house
this affected the cyclist by making him tired
being able to contact people has never been easier
one mood in the memoir was peaceful
how are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp
be you have been trying to lose some extra pounds
dear newspaper you see owning a computer can effect you
some call him  some call him the man and others call him the government
men women and children were playing there
this entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting
and i am right
my mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time
books are used to entertain and even teach readers in certain aspects of life
i alighted with a prayer that god may give him good sense
the features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him
now that computers are so common people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher
you can cut and paste pictures for a project you might have due
authority teaches us as children
it get harder and harder to continue his ride
parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages
i would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others
i believe that this is definitely true because i remember that the same happened to my sister
a lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat
as this paragraph shows internet and computers open more then ever before
so think about it next time you walk into a library and you see something that you not think is right
finally computers help use get information
they would be stuck reading books where they do not learn anything
but i also think the should put them book up in a part were they have adult things and book at
we all wore nice party dresses
it would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor or cigarettes to a minor
several times in the story the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke
no one really goes for walks any more either
learning about their language and habits comes from books
this is a terrifying effect on people because now these computers are brain washing us
a lot of books especially ones on history use language and actions that were used during that time
if they do not like it then they should have never taken it home in the first place
luckily with the help of police they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to 
these magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation
the girl wants to be a whole new person for when the test comes up again
the next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents
but as of right now i do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries
there have been a couple of times where i have walked in a library where i found a couple of books that was offensive towards me
a good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention
this quote i think shows very well that the author is creating a happy mood in his memoir
i know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community
like how happy dose that makes that person that reads the books
the parents on the other hand might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age
in conclusion computers help in all different ways
there you here hundreds even thousands of entries about the 
so get up grab the kids and get going on your new and energized pain free life
go their and hangout with friends interact with them
we have been told that some people think were spending too much time on the computer
using computers billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before
instead looking up what a book was about just read it
so with the sun comes more heat
in conclusion computers are an easier way to get information
but you cant stop everything
therefore i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
it also says that they learned the real definition of family
and that is bad enough
all you will have to type one time or another
after he came to the first town and there was no water he rode on
well you can
burn the average person between the ages of and spend more then hours on a computer
i  computers help you learn about all kinds of things
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful
it does them no good and it could make your community look bad
also if you are talking to someone that has a name of someone you know
that is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library
some materials are very offensive but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries
in the day described
go outside and play with them sit down and play games
ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then
every book should be in the library
in conclusion books movies or anything of that matter should not be took off the shelf because it offended someone
kids like me always have homework on the computer
it was the first time that i had visited such a nice place
together the plant the hibiscus
the mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful
the quote show the loving caring and gratefulness expressed in the memoir by the author
he has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination
keep it on the shelf
and how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information
in this period they do not eat at the day time
from one reader to another taking the on what we read is the real solution
lastly he is grateful to have grown up in a really good home
too but learning about nature is more nature
the city had no idea that this was going to happen they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday
making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material
today however people use technology to find this information
students learning how to type and 
first it started off with the large hills he had to ride up making him work harder and tire himself out quickly
there are lots of books that are at libraries around the world
the new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over
fortunately my friend’s prediction came true
also computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome
memories are being stolen by the awful device that computer
third of all pop up
the freedom of speech is one
was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house
email of course
another way is that of water from severe heat
books fill our minds with noble thoughts
for example for one quest you have to kill a demon but for another just find a missing cat
even though to say people who are on the computer often are shy in person
they will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship
the setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist
he goes from door to door to distribute the letter and moneyorders
but computers are being used for other things
he weighs pounds due to being on the computer all the time
secondly if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer
kids will be kids as well adults will be adults
 you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels
instead of making a really big poster board for project i made a power point instead that was so much easier
one raise the question of these books possibly invoking violence
the speed limit was 
then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist
instead of leaving home they can be cooking doing yoga or speaking a new language all from their computer at home
there was no water either
the subject of so many debates over the years from lawyers against judges to parents against children
you ask yourself why
the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting
so thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this
calling someone or sending a letter costs money but sending on email to someone does not
not only have computers helped kid but they also help adults
the best way to take care of those things nature
this is similar to the way a parent has their children eat healthy food instead of junk as they are growing up
if you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for
adding to his weakness and the extreme heat he also ran out of water causing him to become dehydrated
i had mentioned how computers hold us back the more time we spend the more daylight we burn to do other things
the cyclist had to go on for miles seeing anyone or anything
you could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel
also think of the handwriting factor
computer benefit society greatly
also in the text when over one long crippling hill a building came into view hope was replenished into the cyclist
i believe that it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons
secondly there is the fact that a computer can transport somebody in there mind
he feels happy in this area
even though literary might be offensive some people like reading books like this
i can see where some things in the library are very offensive and where somethings are not offensive
if someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored the author of the book would be even more offended
not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone
they can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble
the paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story
so overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist
at school we use computers all the time
it was really wonderful
is a reliable website to get directions
students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines movies music and books someday in their lifetime
i agree and disagree with the prompt
everyone wants to get in first
secondly i want you to close your eyes
some people enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive
but many people are abusing the and not when to get off
if it is a major issue that highly offends many people it should not be in a public library
i myself have friend who lives in that i miss very much
too much time on your computer means that everyone suffers
the cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers
use a computers and your life will be changed for the better
the cyclist gets very excited when he sees this and gets a great feeling of hope
to look at and use would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive
to this off it would be nice for people to take care of themselves and not stay on the internet for so long
for example when i was in grade in i had to write about 
sometimes internet is not good for children
that effected me because when i heard it i went around people who were positive in my life saying it to them
items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered
for example when it snows
the author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as tumbleweed snakes and lack of water
in addition my third reason i would like you to read is enjoying nature
am i right
the only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable
there are meth labs all over for meth
you also have friends page to see how you are doing
i enjoy the morning walk very much
that was the mood created by the author in the memoir
people find different things offensive that others do not
in my experience i know that when i was to young to understand the happenings of  my parents intercepted the stories from me
books could be a way people escape the real world
it does not solve any problem
you can save anything on a computer
to this day i have not lost the weight i put on from using the computer and i am sure others are to
so computers are not a waste
riding his bike in the hilly dry hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty
computers are bad in someways but good in others
they might not want to get away from the computer
i used to think that talking with someone
it is very hot as the cyclist is riding
the author is happy that had a real family
how would i study
i as a student a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book should be allowed in any library
parents should also care about what there child hears or reads if there young
to conclude i implore you not to try and change the habits of others
the invention of  and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing but it sure did turn into one
dear  is your opinion on computers
when he finally reached the store he was excited and relived
people are not less active
more people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone
also the mood seems to be very thankful
they live on the other side of the 
instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it
libraries could collect viewer comments allowing people who had checked out an item to write what they thought about it
every time her friends asks her about email she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject
secondly computers are informational
no one person has the same thought that the next person does it is impossible
why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to
by downloading from the internet like lime wire
do you like encouragement
authors put language sexual content and violence in books movies and magazines to entertain certain crowds
sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood
the people inside the buses too got wet
the most popular and common of a computer now is communication
that book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past
the flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring
what is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper include information that is not suitable for all groups of people
they do not have any worries
also libraries can do many things so that certain contents not be near others
in conclusion experience with computers can benefit any one person and entire society all together
on the computer it is possible to type out words and not have to get out on eraser for an spelling mistakes
certain television shows books and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many are opposed to
the terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts
with the most common themes of sex drugs and money it seem offensive to some citizens but others just shrug it off as a normalcy
other opinions wont matter
another example is you can use it for projects get all your information and be prepare for a great project
this to me is the way it should be in all libraries
i believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional  the creation of gray areas and the depletion of classic literature
when it comes to books music movies or magazines i believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol
those are the reasons that point to the mood of this excerpt being grateful or gratefulness
you can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by
there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk
censorship is one of them
libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information
is the computer getting in your way
the quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly
most people found at that it was not the person they thought they were
second when he ran out of water
i really consider leaving computers to what they do best helping humans
here are three reasons why first would be that with advances in tech
a third mood in the memoir is love
if they want to play that game or read that book they should be allowed
books are just one thing there are also movies music magazines and etc
it is possible for anything to offend anyone
i think high schools to put these books into the libraries because it might help some kids grow up and become more mature
no matter the case with work a computer always helps
when the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her drivers test
so write an article regarding the need for the use of computers and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them
they allow people to talk online
how does the computer effect people
it gives people a chance to understand how the real world 
there are few areas of the earth where no rain falls for
literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture
it should be held in a separate area if people do not wish to view this material they simply do not go in that area
you wont to have a real good laugh
they should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries
that is why i think the mood is love
passionate music witch he adores today
show or you can watch music videos
there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library
there are always going to be negatives and positives but libraries tend to stick with the positive side
the gypsies use donkeys to carry
the condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike they might have not be so dehydrated
in the old days if you did not about something or someone like a movie you never find any info about them
they think people spend to much time on the computer and are getting less exercise
flat road is much easier to bike on then hills
kids will still fight and rough house
the creates a mood that makes you think about your self and your family
so if we keep all our book then more students and people would go and read
if you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read
first computers are not good for your eyes
people gets bullied and it has on effect on your schoolwork
magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people
this feeling of graciousness tells about the love and sacrifice he feels his parents went through for him
our bodies need to stay healthy and fit
this is a good thing about computers but also a bad thing
in my opinion the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society
ten minutes becomes one hour in a snap
dear the  your resources your entertainment even your communication with people might be fading
when a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like
when we cut down trees we are harming our environment
it ruins their social lives and other bad things
in my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days
do you have out of state family you wish to talk to
far from the reach where kids and children are able to access
this is my third school yet on the day i joined it was very nervous
secondly libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public
we do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them
do not exceed posted speed limit
the memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories
some novels more than others have a lot more graphic content such as 
people love entertainment
my two uncles live in 
the desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function
then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride the roads went from flat sheet to short rolling hills
every year more and more books of significance to literature are being taken off of the shelves in our local libraries and classrooms
before the computer people had lose success in writing quickly
computers are slowly making people less educated
for example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better
censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society
many people take this as a serious thing
she gains determination through the reminder of this
people believe in different things
there are books movies magazines and computers that anyone that want to get on can do so
so yes computers are good for people
lastly if children become addicted they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework
that make me desire to read it even more than before
this also leads to higher crime rate believe it or not
you name it they got it
furthermore computers are great for all kinds of research and directions
they are a key to growing learning and discovering
so a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat the computer will write the project neatly
as you can see computers have a lot of great uses
why spend hundreds or on a tool that is not even necessary
if the was never invented how would you talk to people from around the world
why would you choose the computer
you finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again
if you are choosing the computer over other important thing then i think we have a problem
although kids should start going outside computers teaches kids new things and is useful
no parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means
however some experts believe that people spend to much time on computers and that people are not as active or healthy because of it and
it is a part of history
the growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others
that also can help make projects
because everything has some kind of purpose to it and has some kind of message in it for each and every person to discover
it was a sunday evening
poor directions heat and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story
many people hear that sentence more than once everyday
there is a majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or 
dear newspaper my name is 
but also you can play a lot of different games and also type on an notepad
computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion
he should wear clean clothes
the internet also opens up the doors to video games
computers educate people about places all over the world
other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or shows
what with all the fun stuff you can do who can blame them
the text states a young pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
he plays different games with me and also helps me with my homework
at eight o’clock we have dinner
that is why the author concludes with that
last winter our family went to simla a famous hill station
finally my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be
we need them
this means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills
we all decided to stay inside the house
they should just get rid of it
there are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place
because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature
another example would be the series
after this the road was replaced by short rolling hills
also the weeds and snakes frightened him
my mother  brother and myself visited the library one evening
the author writes about how this small simple home was very special home to him and also how much it meant to him
he felt grateful and thankful for his parents love and sacrifice
whats not to like
there are so many helpful things to use it for
she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries
led him to listening to a metal band called  
so if you take away the thing we like what will we have to do after school when we go to the 
but i saw in the afternoon that only my father was coming jump to home
in my opinion i think that the author sets a loving mood
the lack of water also mad it difficult for him
if it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section
libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs
she says that she will try again
the mood created by the author is both and love
then you have magazines
he was running out of water the sun was beginning to beat down and he was probably tired of pedaling
i believe that there are certain movies music and other things that are bothering parents
my mother gave prizes to the winners
that would be a waste of time and money
not at all
magazines are good for a couple of different nice things
today are seeing going outside
she will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring
so lastly join me and help the world know that computers are good
many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show
it can also help learn a lot of things
also people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer
one day we were all sitting near the pool after the day’s session
i try to complete my work then go to the computer before dance
let alone not even be there to begin with
my father bought me few picture postcards and my mother also shopped a bit
the cyclist in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to national park
guess is terrible
people like different movies and some movies can be offensive
there are a lot of advantages to computers
you race back to the library only to find out that it is closed
everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them
in the story the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life
some of the literature and other material you find in libraries however are not intended for certain people such as young children
this is where some kids go because they are addicted to the computer
some people might not agree with me
i know this because in the story he states that it feels around degrees
an ideal teacher is never angry with his students
but you have to make sure you get a good computer
dear editor of local newspaper you know that the average person spends three or more hours each day on the computer
take time out of you day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside
the eldest son is a spoilt child
weather it be a different culture or even schoolwork a computer is helpful
it also can help children with school homework
the heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist
they can go find a different one
for example the lack of water was the biggest thing
a while later the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings
from my point of view yes because libraries are public which means they are open to any and everyone
ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk and felt great
however because of this invention computers have allowed us to do incredible things
it would not have something little children would want
she described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes
in addition computers give us the power to learn about faraway places
i and my youngest sister remain at home some fear
generally once a year
you could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes
he took her one day to hospital to get treatment for her aliment
i will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game come along
there so many different ways you can do it to
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
gyms are way better than computers
every morning i hear its chirping
although the is a government run facility many people will go elsewhere to find the materials wanted to view the censored media
nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose
in books music movies and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better then something fun
there will always be something in the world you do not like
although the invention of chat online was meant as quick easy communication it became a horror crime in most cases
i have been in a library a few times in my life
their was no way i could find out way the was killing the people over in that town
no little kid should be looking at or reading those books or movies
i hope that you will take these reasons to heart
it revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming
the idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless
lastly when you learn how to type you have a good shot at getting a good job because you no hot to type and work a computer
people have learning talking and advances in technology with one click of a mouse
do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them
they can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime
teaches me how to type
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because there are no cars building water or people in sight
this is why computers are bad
then the main level or area should be teen books
offensive material can also grief
what one set of parents want to limit their child from reading vary from another set of parents
i was surprised to see the activities people throughout the day
of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help
books that teachers would like to give to there class to read
children at young ages still have their innocence
she works for three houses so she learned to type really fast
government service according to me is meant for the mediocre
eventually they got to talking about his journey and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut
people should have the option to read or watch what they wish
hot you need water
i have seen many offensive books
yes we do live in a world where everyone is judged by how they 
such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants
in this quote the cyclist realizes his isolation and begins to become more determined to reach his destination
it all depends on how you look at it and what type of person you are
not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues but it is also a great way to contact people
the man is badly dehydrated but in his determination he moves on
books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader some even find the books relatable
this is how setting affects cyclists
the sections in a library range from mystery to romance so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them
during this season it is neither too cold nor too hot
the computers a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies
when the narrator finally finds a building it turns out to be abandoned
did you know that the positive effects computers have on people the negative
friends actually affect you health
childhood is very impressionable age
eventually if continues to drop at this the will have a world that went
you would want your seven year old child seeing inappropriate or offensive material right
if you have family or friends that live far away or in another country then you can communicate them by computers
another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer
computers provide an excellent variety education in our society
when the eight grade did reports their information
first of all more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should
in the end i think computers benefit people around the world
i know that computers help me with research all the time when i do projects or write papers for school
that is why they have sections for the books but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose
the first girl asked
when i went to the library as a kid i went with my parents
my final reason why computers are good is that they serve instant pleasure
it has a high hump
people will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases
so that is my view on the situation people should enjoy whatever material they like
another thing is children taken books off shelves
people become overweight also
some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it if they did not like the book movie music or magazine
although somethings we need to see the things that people have in heads
dear local newspaper i feel that computers are very beneficial to our society
the other things you can figure it out on your own
dear  do you think is the best technology made so far
i think computers definitely have a positive effect on people
and the growing realization that i would die of heatstroke
she asked my sister to switch off the transistor
first of all the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism
i do feel that some books should be monitored and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age
morning walk gives me health and happiness
the mood in this memoir was it had a nice feeling and it was a motivating story
the author does this for several reasons
censorship is effectively unconstitutional
there is the fact that you can talk to theme 
also written in our of  we are given the right to say what we want and nobody can control that
to whom it concern many hours a day do you spend on the computer
i think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a room just for grown ups
read the following to know just how important computers really are
these are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society
but when i get on a computer it gets to be much better
they are one of the most growing technologies in our world
therefore the setting was affecting to the cyclist
why would something that yes is offensive to some but would grab promote and keep some within it
technology can teach people things that they do not even know they could do
besides practically unlimited information you can stay in touch with your family using 
from my personal experience i always do spring cleaning because i want to begin fresh
they could also find interesting things to see in that country
please speak up and explain i would love to hear it
people wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over
in conclusion i was asked to write a paper to you seeing if i would like to keep computers or not
with electronic devices such as the player and so on most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly
my reason why you ask
secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways
looking at places far away is always an option
well there you have it computers are good  bad we just have to be 
computers it the more advanced technology so its the people is using it
you understand why books are placed on shelves for in the first place no its not for the money
my second reason that i believe computers are good to have around is
people are different and believe in different things
spring is the time when animals come out of their winter holes when trees blossom and when the snow melts
there was a big garden
and to that i agree entirely
although it made me very frightened it taught me a very good lesson
everything that was on was not as bad in my opinion
 in ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly
the author show that no matter if your rich or poor you can still have a closely knit family
looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book
everything started out fine until he reached the second town
teaching you parents how to use is a great responsibility for your actions
i was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age
it took her a lot to move to but was glad did
the lorries buses cars and other vehicles passed on the way
are many different web sites to go on and talk to friends and family
the effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to
instead of going to the same place every vacation you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting
then i will take that test again
and happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends
i specially grow in the coastal part
so for just reasons i would already rethink
if someone is walking into a library they have to be responsible
i agree with the latter statement
then the bottom level should be the children level
the author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why
as he came to the first town he describes it as a ghost town having no water and no human contact for some time
i have heard of people who have gotten mad because there was a nude picture in an art book
many people will answer this question differently
do you see our future now
everyone has their rights and if writing music and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access
they use their tail for swimming
is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive
last but not least watching tv take a lot of time and it makes us lazy
how can you consider what is offensive and what is not
and last the service
books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain
it is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate
this is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society
suggest that certain material not only be impacting children and teens but adults are highly affected as well
either way your learning
people have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books magazines  etc
also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination
not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around
in our modern day people spend to time on computers
most media is viewed because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows books and music
but you stay home to webcam with your aunt
do your rights end where mine begin
the library had historical movies but i ended up watching that by myself
music is offensive but like i said only found in the adult area
being on the computer too much can harm your brain also
i was eleven years old
i know someone who has a and after school all they do is talk to people
since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water the dry long hills seem to make him more weak and tired
they blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see
and probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town
others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us
reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before
my conclusion is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit
young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds
is right we can also be aware of the environment
yup trees are killed for them
they just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside
people have opinions and that is one hundred percent okay
i am here to say that that is a terrible accusation
in conclusion people can communicate with friends and relatives
he ends up getting lost
first and foremost there are lots of things to do
there are games on websites
people all over the world by laptops to travel to one place to another
the hibiscus was the thing to make her happy
and did i say it was against the law because it is
have you ever been offended by a movie book song or magazine
second reason for this is that anything and every thing you can get on the you can get from books
you can look into going there for vacation or doing a report
she realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail
my first reason was that if you don know something you could look it up
a person who not have children might say  one little joke can hurt
online poker could be dangerous
in my mind we should all have computers because there fun and you can learn about everything you could think of so we should all have them
if the cause is if its offensive then all books should be gone
my mother is a secretary down town at the low form called 
the final reason is parents can limit what their own children read
first when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends
the author was grateful thankful and never forgot his home
older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack
it is impossible to please everyone so what should be done
there are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people
they should not be banned though they should only be moved
ho are doing
have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on 
they help us in a lot of way and they also help us find new friends and new updates
this empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty
songs movies books and magazines could provide that for their child
now with computers people can instant message or email anyone anywhere in the world
each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy
in conclusion computers are hurting our society clearly they are unhealthy for our bodies
she is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful
another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people
dear  i think that computer are a waste of time but they also help you in many ways
magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child
in conclusion i believe that computers affect on people
some books say sexual things in them that offend a race of some type or a gender
maybe kids of all ages should have identification
furthermore to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder
the fact that if he stops at all ever then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it
reading these books and listening to this kind of music and watching these kinds of movies takes a whole different point of view
finally drug use should not be issued in books to kids
these are the kids that are likely to get bad cramps
these computers help with everyday life
i would also say knowing some things are good but be careful of knowing too much
this is so offensive
without a computer people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong
social networks only just make this even worse
in conclusion internet these days are very good for people
i have no idea why any person would want to take booksmusicmovies and magazines away from us
for example if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write on email
can only learn so much from a world history textbook
there are health problems created by computers but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily
to fail and try again shows great inner strength
i hope i will at least be half a perfectionist as he is
he tells us stories when we do not have a class
as you can see time is a valuable thing which computers can help save
if someone to a country that they have they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture
secondly the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool
she will take the test a second time and pass
computers is one of the technology that helps people
another great thing about talking online is that i can talk to all my friends not just the one i am playing with
did you know that a computer teacher in life say if you need to use a computer in your will one already
libraries should not have those kind of books music movies magazines etc
why waste your time
yes i do think computers are awesome idea
so i emailed him and how i get a response and i fixed my laptop
the more we all get used to it  the less many people will actually run into items that offend them
also if you are in the army and have a baby you can watch as they take their first steps or say their
when you talk on the phone to someone it costs you money
books will take a few days and you only have days to research create and organize your project and data
once he passed a couple of troubling sights because they were abandoned and no one was around he began to worry
once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public
and how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad
because she saying when the grow back she will be to take the test again
so now you can see why i believe that such things like books music movies magazines etc
some say that computers are bad for you but they can really benefit society
movies music and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths
because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have
when you think of computers what comes to mind
if certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now have never have been read
you could do what my aunt does
perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many but select few will still value the media for what is
in my opinion i think that computers have a good affect on people
in the text
it is a really irritating agent which get people danger up
children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future
you can play mindless video games
the author chose to end the story this way for several reasons
this is why libraries should have more than one copy
many people that do not have computers depend on the library
the last i have is spending more time with family than on the computer
everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers
for example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket
so get of the computer and go 
many schools call these books magazines and movies 
people drink camels’ milk
without computers people would be less educated about the people cultures and the world we live in 
lastly my final reason is the most simplest enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside
with all the entertainment a computer can produce who could hate it
some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and hanging with your friends and family
they also help us connect with no another and help us excel in school
they were gone
when something goes against too many of those things people get upset
teenagers should be aloud to watch kid movies and teen movies
sometimes we she take a break from them and enjoy nature
it part of life though
first the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling and an inability to refill his water bottle
pink are my favorite
we have today the great epics in the form of scriptures and literature
i for one agree computers are helpful because they help you learn about new things talk to people around the world and try new things
i have never seen movie and listening to my friends talk about it i do not want to
in addition the geese returning symbolizes a new beginning
i think computers are great
not looking at a computer screen
so my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit
part this is due to spending too much time on the computer
the world today in the is hardly free
a grope juice factory taunts him mocks him but he continues on with a steady pace
no one is to make people to get people offline
the setting of this passage played a key role in the story
you have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person
people who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that effects them negatively
one example is when they talk about all being a family and letting people stay
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country
some of the material be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them
computers are the building blocks of our medical world
this is very convenient
i do believe so
and are websites where you can chat with friends and see peoples pictures
being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely
a censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice
people eventually will not be able to use libraries
i feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods
there are many reasons why computers can sometimes not be safe for your children or teens
even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds
but people experience less the outside world when they surround themselves with technology
and it was times better and free and better
they do not cover their eatables from dust and flies
times are tough money is tight and electronics are expensive
there were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water
when a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer
when you are given a book in school for a class assignment they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you
in any case a more effective solution must exist today
the man started becoming very unsure
the material is not serious enough
libraries have sections for all ages
it also was very hot during his journey
computers have a of knowledge and more is added everyday
i once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the religion
there are many reasons and examples that support this
new friends can be made everyday
hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers
the main issues that most people have with books are foul language sex and difference in opinion
i at once rushed outside
dear readers some of you might think people exercise computers
when they had no children of their own the suffering of homeless children invoked sympathy in their hearts
it also can start serious issues with feuding religious groups or persons of different ideas
she is determined to pass the test when spring arrives and blossom again
children today are exposed to more explicit topics but i doubt they would want to read a book about them
public libraries are a far different story
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
in my years of reading i have read a few books that were questionable
libraries should never remove any material just because it be found offensive
can tell that the author wants to also feel grateful
the setting in the short story rough road ahead do not exceed speed limit greatly affects the cyclist
of people in would floor
 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers
but also i think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it
my first reason is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life
by spending all day on the computer you will get fat lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life
people have their own opinions and views on materials
computers can do more harm then good in a house hold
many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow
but it is quite different from the mother planet
if we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries
i feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not
computers are a great way to explore
the mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood
everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care not hatred
there are a lot of examples that make me think that
the concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story
that reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites
we can not talk to my family or friends
it gives them time to grow up themselves
being on the computer is not a bad thing sometimes
my whole family lives in and it costs us twice as much to make a call there
movies books magazines newspapers music and much more flash and sell more than they should
to one it seem like all they do is seat themselves in a pull a few levers and push a few buttons
i think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend
one setting feature is the rolling of steep hills
he is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners and kiss them
long distance phone calls cost a lot
i once read a book that i found in our school library that was about slavery
do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have
he plastered him on his ribs
he was profusely bleeding
computers are very environmental friendly and so are people today
one theme of the story is to never give up
literature is an escape for many people it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading
what organizational tool could help me in this situation
however although computer can be such a good thing it can be bad as well
all types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that
now a days material that is offensive to some is all around
to me that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home
this is my take on the whole situation
all in all the setting seems to have the intention of king him
rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
even though there are factors like age beliefs and knowing what you are going into i think these materials are just bad for everyone
they are leaving behind and would do anything to give them better lives
putting violent books in an area that is blocked to under the age of is an effective way to restrict children
for example an explicit music album
it eases your mind to be absorbed in something
books can help a child overcome poverty mental challenges and violence everyday
the human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates
take away computers and people will die alone and sad
for example i was going on a band trip with all the other band students and on the way there we put on a movie
most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope  the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong
inside we boarded a small train which took us around the park
on the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more
in the follow paragraphs i will continue to support more of my answer
people all have their own opinions all media can be learned from and our freedom should not be restricted
people use computers for work
in elementary school libraries i think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought and used in the library
the theme of this story could be seen things discourage you
i will explain these reasons below but before i begin i would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear
it gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply
he loves the 
we should not
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways
for example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam
after the first couple town he starts to ride on short rolling hills
for all those lovers out there the computer is an alternative
what is your choice in these actions
do you want to lose a friend or family member
lastly computers help us stay close to our family and friends
one person deem inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person
you have seen my views and what i believe
i know that when i have time to go on the computer i am not looking up things to learn
many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information
surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes
instead of removing the books others love to read what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music
here is evidence from the article
typing is also another advantage
dear local newspaper i think computers are great sources
people who use computers for many hours are just sitting still
a mother of a student in 
also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on 
how can one take that freedom away from another
by living in  one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please
we have the obligation to keep the that we have created alive
in my opinion people should use the computers but not a lot
there are baby books kids sections teenage and adults sections as well
a and  and colon
as a result the computer should be used wisely
i cant even remember the last time i went a day without a computer
also from different types of reading censorship has definitely become a serious issue but it should be abolished
i knew i have
was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again
having things censored ruins a lot of things the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way
to of children who use the internet are most likely so succeed in college because they know what websites to go to and how to get there
eventually there would be no books left
 people need to interact with real people
sports  just a true story that has happen to someone an etc
using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand
which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united
there are millions of people in the world
in the evening i go to play with my friends
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder
now lot of
some people on the other side of the river heard our voices and they jumped into the river
computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers
just like the author is going back to drivers ed
computers are damaging peoples health  should be something done about it
the author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir
just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place
to catch up with friends or to talk something with another
for children who are old enough to use  work a computer they be inside on that nice day
people can also be any one they want online
every player cooperates with other player in defeating the other side
he lives in a small cottage near the market
some people think that a man who has many sons and daughters is a lucky person
we will no longer have a respected society
the mother would be taking away what i like to read and watch
that shows her important computers are and how convenient
the librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line
as you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information
but as i got into the books the more mature they got
yet look at all of the advantages to a computer
it helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through
the power of man resides in his mind
the features of the setting in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way
i am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good
when kids see or even hear things like this they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try
then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water
they provide us wood for fuel
also there are games on the computer that can help you with math
people should stop doing this you forget to exercise nature and to spend time with you friends and family
books magazines movies and music are created with a huge diversity
magazines are in some ways just as useful as books
my second reason is if you have a computer you can look up questions that you would have
i going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life
so many teens read that book and found it interesting
once again i do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive
a synonym for solidarity is unity so here the author is even saying how his neighborhood all united into one big happy neighborhood
life has gotten easier for everyone
another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things
this made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people
first we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back
i agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers as well as most things in the world we live in
i do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading
all they worry about is winning the game
it has made our long distance friendship easier and closer
the music should only be something children are suppose too listen too things that are in their age group
nothing ask yourself that
without computers we could not be where we are today
why make the company lose investment over something that could be easily taken care of simply taking it back where you got it from
also when he passed the grape juice factory it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty
this would happen we banned computers
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it expresses the meaning of the story
he shows that in growing up in such a wonderful family and home that he felt that the experience he had in his home was just exceptional
he knows how to act in an emergency
computers can have benefit society
this solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them
the main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight books and personal creativity
some people go to the library just to see them kind of books
children are easily affected in behavior maybe they just saw a movie of and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him
he was bummed out because he could never get outside
sometimes he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
i believe if they put the books movies and other stuff on the shelf than it should be able to be read by children and others
children not understand right now what is wrong with the economy but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much
expressing what you think about a certain topic
the next day we went on a city tour
if there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty
we need to show them that we care
first off if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle
they are good at students too
most of it is very helpful information
i think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what
lets throw an other aspect here about money
also in  he describes how his neighborhood was like a family
all terms of offense are based on an opinion
later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply
how does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves
i think people spend to much time on computers especially teenagers
ambition has the top priority in the life of every man
that is why computers are so positive
knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling
another reason why i believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this
its amazing you can be anywhere talking to anyone you want
i think that there should be an age policy for libraries
computers can be fun and interesting but people are spending to much time on the computer
your screen fills with choices of information sites
there are many types of materials in the library to entertain you
but if your newspaper were written out by hand then that would take a lot of time people paper  money
just remember that social sites video sites and make life better
explicit or eighteen or older books movies magazines or music be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library
if all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past
websites that are selling stolen merchandise
 out of people surveyed in  agree that the use of computers benefits society
social networks like allow your to keep your friends posted on what you are doing
she wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain
not only that but they also have exercise plans
he probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way
on the other hand the computer can come with much use
or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to
now does some of those books seem a little better now
the library is for everyone not just you specifically
all guys love cars
when they ended the story i thought to myself how nice it ended
some people do not have a computer home
there are many hills and the terrain changes a few times
i am pretty sure if it never got checked out they would get rid of it
i think the mood the author set is loving
in fact out of jobs require a computer
our society is just going downhill from here
censorship in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can stumble upon it is the best choice
use but you would need and it
i also have many friends
but he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay
everyone is entitled to their own opinion but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch
the community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck
they turn people into low life scums and criminals
also if you do have one than reading this persuade you into getting one
if the reader does not like the book they are able to close it
if everyone else starts taking books off the shelf we have no books left
what are they going to be reading
my last reason is you can make friends
nature has its own scheme of colours for sustenance and renewal of its rhythm and cycle
lastly interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer
hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients
the use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives
i typed in nature parks on a search engine and sister is back to traveling all over 
in this book  the main character and eventually the protagonist a firefighter that cause fires instead of putting them out
should not be censored
they try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths
but the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word
they are my family too
using the computers can help us learn about other places in the world
this is why i believe the author ended the story this way
but in many different ways
i tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book
then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch
she missed every ball thrown to her
the question is do computers have a negative or positive effect on people
we should be grateful for friendships
the people who are of proper age will be able to get the material however
internet is great for communication
so why should your point of view affect another person
well in conclusion i agree with the fact that because of the fact that people have computers makes them lazy and do not interact with their family
these are all websites that have chats where people can communicate
this is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by  
they do not have limbs
a lot of times in families instead of spending time together
so what do you think about them
these types of snakes are found in african forests
and those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you
obviously computers are beneficial
using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones even if you are communicating with them on the computer
this is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves
the day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert made it worse
we are the and parents
it is a body of rock and moon dust
newton made many other discoveries
the author was speaking very proudly and happy about her parents
i think almost every movie might offend someone in some way so if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead
for movies they tell you things like   and other things like that
what is your choice to this difficult question
almost of parents feel that same way
the outside world
this special area should be clearly marked with a sign that says  content and should only be able to be viewed by adults
computers can be used just for fun too
music has the power to say things and communicate with and make statements that could only be made by music
the removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come
if a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things
dark clouds were coming down and covering the blue sky
materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content
when the road began the change the speakers determination did too flat road were replaced by short hills
libraries should not take certain books movies and magazines away that some people find offensive
now think to yourself would you risk taking away someones favorite book
it would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything
in one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down
the material we read music we listen to and the movies we watch should be our decision to make
whenever i see them i wish if i were a bird and i could also fly like them
offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on
i remember going on and seeing something pop up about my favorite band breaking up
another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows
it is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone
even in school kids use internet on their cell phones
people are having less and less human interactions as computers become more popular
i check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes
the hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life
this is very bad for your health and body
computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources
my mom says computers are one the most hardiest tools in the world
the cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him

some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life
they can always hide them in the rooms in a desk draw for child safety
for example their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers
dear  you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things
books provide facts and more reliable information than what you can hear from people
mainly they seem very helpful but others can have different opinions
people could also see animals other people the environments and anything else they want to learn about
my friends blew on whistles when i cut the cake
people choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves and with those come their personal opinions
it is impossible
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
the last thing that i am going to talk about is how i feel on censorship in libraries
as soon as i return home it wags its tail to welcome me
the last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life
this is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling
some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people
sure of course the computer has a couple downsides
you can find your information and make something out of it
she would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home
computers can help with that
she misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers
so at the end of the story she said i will take that test again
but technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people
you can also keep in touch with friends
obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common and its because young people are glued to their computer screens
what if some one found your favorite book offensive
going on a picnic will give you time to get to know new people
as he started to head out the scenery changed
where ever you go there is always some sort of 
no later than a day when was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her
i urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet
some books be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book
if not properly exposed to something there is absolutely no way to be prepared to encounter it in the future
if one person found my favorite book offensive i would not want it taken off the shelves completely
this shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water
people are concerned that too many people are spending too much time on their computers
the plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring
also you can put clothes and other store products an hold
so she just looks up the definitions on the computer instead of taking the time to find them in the dictionary
now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart and make things better for everyone
how happy i was
they try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be
that is another feature that will affect him
computers help people so much in schools work places and at home

please keep reading to hear my ideas

while the cyclist was riding along the sun was beginning to beat down on him

in his spare time he entered
because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service my dad could not call using his cell phone
or why is he not touching her
he had a positive attitude as it states with strong legs and a smile on my face
in other words computers are pleasurable
libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted
any concerned person technologically challenged would agree the countless ones on the computer are no good for the health of our country
will never forget the house because it is where learned the real definition of family
plus act would be completely unconstitutional

it allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them

even now they have somethings where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer
if made her hopeful 
computers can be great things
they should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem the lack of education
all websites that can stay in contact with your best friends
to censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities destroy our profitable media and be unconstitutional
i hope you will trust me that the computer has a positive effect on society
it is wise to set censors in the libraries for students
this could not work in our society today
they can help with homework interacting with people and even help us with exercising
that was a quote from paragraph 
i believe that having computers are a very good thing
but how do you keep a young child from checking out a book movie or magazine about inappropriate adult material
he can be seen riding a bicycle
the place was full of people from different countries
libraries are there for us to learn and enjoy ourselves
but its not
also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy
computers are ruining us they deter our social skills damage our health and cause us to be lazy
the water was icy cold and made my fingers numb
the subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times
the mood that the author has is and happy
if content in a library is considered offensive should still remain on the shelf regardless
soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid
it says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home
and children need to get away from their computers
this is why i think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across
should be censored to protect the younger generations
there are many benefits to having a computer
when you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about
i think computer will help us learn and do things faster
dear local newspaper people think that computers educate people for the future but i think that they actually harm children and adults as well
libraries are for all kinds of people
thanks for taking the time to read this
and there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures
dear local newspaper opinion is yes people are on the computer to much
for example why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing to them
who is to blame for opening the book and reading it
going outside is very important to your health
the author concludes the story with the paragraph she did to tell people never to give up
this shows how special the house was to him
books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them
do yo think censorship is a good thing
as she reaches home she is greeted by her mother
did you know that at least an hour exercise is needed everyday
my last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper
well i think that it has a positive effect
so go go go have yourself some fun
this is inevitable
the fresh air in the park refreshes my mind and body
this is what my family did on our vacation to and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online
when i say this i mean like you have a computer connect with them on the computer
not every child learns the same way nor are they interested in the same things
as you can see the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society
i have people that be able to have computer addiction
i believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons
why should the views of some hinder all others
usually after that they are done with the magazine
a parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this
i have had my experience with books who are offensive to me
these allow you to send someone a message faster and easier
for example the libraries have information on the history
i strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all
it could be a website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future
the mood in this memoir is caring and loving
if this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything
this quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination
there is this book we read this year called  are 
looking out for what are children see is a large matter the other side though is the thought of people getting ideas from reading more intense books
the library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something
the computer is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends
a school cannot function smoothly without discipline
there are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them
many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial
also you probably will need a computer in college
one positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate
it is also used for generating electricity and building houses
it did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods
so when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place
in conclusion computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us
no matter how offensive they might be there are many other ways to solve this problem
in the story there are many reasons to suspect shy she ended the story with that paragraph
it is amazing technology because even someone is in a different country you can communicate with them in the click of a button
that when i have issues seeing where they think they have the right
the internet was not just created for the heck of it
the setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in
this problem is similar to others around the world
recently my grandmother moved down to and i can only talk to her on the phone
what the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work
computers give us a way to communicate with long distance friends and family
if a child becomes use to the ease of searching an item on a computer he will expect all things to be equally simple
next time you are picking out a book and you find it offensive think about how other people might want to read it
your loved ones they are always there for you when you need them
computers is the big thing because we need to look up a lot of things online we need computers to test on
computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle
the offensive part out of the book helped myself relives a new understanding
everything has a base in nature even ourselves
so when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out
many trees get uprooted
as you can see i feel strongly that the computer has positive effects on people
they are very mysterious when it comes to that
there might be a certain speed that a person types and to pass the class and the teacher could assign practice on your own home computer
people should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are
this is needed especially in school
heat hills and ghost towns all are features of setting that affect the cyclist
if a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit they should not be allowed to have the book
lastly i think that computers provide us with fun activities entertainment and a to relax
as like movies though they are there to provide entertainment
for someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom
in these websites people share their information
but what about the other people
that is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far
people hear cuss words probably everyday whether its at school or home
libraries in i am going to write a persuasive essay about what i think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book
if they work on computers during a long period of the day head home to spend more time on the computer whats that doing to your body
the water was very hot and tasted very nasty
but if we did no have this book we would be sure to expect another on our hands
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
players have to look at an incoming ball and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball
i believe is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion
after all when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left
without the internet this would almost be impossible
you just might make a new friend along the way
then she would say well was the one who watched the movie
they can tell you a lot by just the touch of keypad and the click of a mouse
they should feel safe letting their children look through all the books at the library
computers allowed more jobs to be made and replaced
the features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story
a cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them
another reason why i think is if your friend is explaining something to you that your
these are just a few reasons why i think the effects of computers is good and i hope the local newspaper agrees too
have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us
although the cyclist chuckles about it this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him
it also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine
there are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff and people who want your personal info
people want to move forward but can we not make a compromise
as simple as it is you do it or do not
a soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a of a company
i think we need to reform this problem soon
go to the gym and loose some of that extra body weight
before you know it will have to know how to work a computer
actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town
computer usage will keep you in the 
it is now in the hands of the  whether our kids grow up to be the future of  or the joke of 
if one person thinks an art piece looks unique another not see any true beauty
the setting led to her deteriorating health
he was grateful for his parents caring and selflessness
my third reason is that interacting with friends an family
this are my three ideas to the news paper article
everyone needs to look at both sides of the story
some say that offensive things should be censored
if he runs out of water he will die
they also help you to get ready and not be stock in your house on that nice day in 
my reason for using this is because my work is important to me
movies tell you what it is rated
so why have censorship in libraries
censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept
do citizens have the right to remove books magazines and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content
they sit there like lumps
then that one special book you wanted to read is now off limits
the things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored
that is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment
as the memoir continues the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents
in addition computers help you learn more about people places and cultures
instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family there is also video chat
do people have the right to limit freedom
however the cycle is a good source of the body
in conclusion computers have an effect on people
why not let them challenge themselves in a good book that they got to pick out
one reason he helps you with your hand eye coordination for example teach you how you look while typing
an idle person depends too much on chance
the most important function of the computer is education
in all these ways computers help people everywhere and
let media be free so men women and children from all over the globe can be unique and wonderful
books are the same way as movies and music
those are two examples of how the mood is loving
you then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard
just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school believe it or not
is very cruel to animals
this is how i spent my recreation and leisure
in this memoir the author touches upon serious facts while giving the memoir a fun and happy mood
these are the reasons i chose both and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt
by waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to
lastly computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience
people are spending way to much time on computers because there addicted to them over weight and not getting any exercise
it would solve a lot of problems
instead of calling a number why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer
i was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean
being on the computer does no good for the body
these hills reduced his stamina greatly
my last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends
another reasons i would like you to hear is less time exercising
there are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting
too which leads to lack or exercise
dear  i believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it
the more time spent on a computer the more you damage your vision
this leads to a downward spiral of our society
in the final paragraph she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds
this is why we have public libraries
they will also provide information and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea
this absolutely benefits society
i believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure
most websites give the ability for anyone to do so
the players feel a sensation of joy
now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely but that is not how it works in many cases
some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it
i just think that certain books music and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them
the world would be forced to be silent
i think that they should throw this book away
the wardboys were also equally careless
i support computers and their advancement
censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book song movie or magazine is found offensive in any way
i have the morals and the mind to choose for myself is good or bad
what would we do without them
there were people from different states and different areas of the train
he is very tall and the most beautiful one in the stable
computers are also help young children to old adults learn new things
overall computers have a bad effect on people
that clearly shows one of the things we need computers for
second you can make online job applications
computers put a positive effect of people
the first reason being if you found something offensive it not be to someone else
to conclude computers have a positive effect on people
the first reason why is that most spend their time social networking
i walked outside to get the mail and newspaper
like movies there are ratings such as which means that you should be or older to view it
in most cases no
this stampcollecting hobby refreshes my mind
we as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the 
besides there are more important issues at the moment
the only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back
also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others
we need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through
even now there be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one individual editor
now the content of some books are not always appropriate
another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason
typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor
computers also can teach you how to speak a language
now more than ever people use where they talk to friends
by keeping the harsh language i feel as if people realize how much harder times were
dear newspaper   more and more people in our proud and courageous country of have been
the first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies
when people need help they read a book or look it up
it is happy but slightly sad
children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to but sometimes we can not stop that
it is always good to discuss with others before we do anything
no matter who you are you probably have some favorite band music artist or genre of music that you prefer
is it something that creates negative attention
or do you think they could be useful in many ways
obtain an email address type a message and click send
i think books or movies or music that have curse words a part of life because most adults curse
you can talk to your friend on there so they on being social
although this information be in a local library
she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she will take it again
we need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids
you can live without then very easily and without them the world would be a better place
the features of the setting really affected the cyclist
it is also unknown that what is offensive to one person might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background
the computer is a very valuable too
think of it this way it has magnetic forces that pull people to it and keep them for hours
mr david is a wealthy businessman
social skills are the difference between success and failure
our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence so we think it is okay to do
but worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures
the author was running out of water throughout the whole story
her mother will be proud of her
education has never been so easy thanks to our advanced network and computers
as humans we are given certain freedoms and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press
reading is my last hobby and i have collected a lot of titles during the past threefour years
lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world
there are many books movies magazines etc
family planning should be adopted to control the birth of children
if the libraries removed everything that could offend someone they would have no materials left
besides the telephone computers do have some bad things about them too
i fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading
some were discussing politics
it also goes on to say that it was a test for my inner spirit
i say influence because studies and personal views have shown that teens and even young children are often influenced by explicit views portrayed by media
people who things and world famous people from back then compared to famous people now
people can connect with others from all over the world
whenever you open your magazine you find different topics but they all deal with either sex drugs or violence
the classrooms would be wellfurnished
censorship or not
when parents get movies they try and keep those scenes hidden from their children
the setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way
thanks for reading bye
in this situation it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this
there were many moods set by the in the memoir
no matter how hard the task is we should keep trying until we succeed
books even be inappropriate for little kids
they also provide learning experiences with many resources at your finger tips
computers give people a place to interact with others
make the smart choice
the younger you are you can learn more about the stuff
it holds information and has website when the internet they
then there was a ladder show
you would have to go all the way to the library find the right book and read it
because the fancy technology will be here till years too come
he calls his home a warm home
he pedaled on but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well he found the water to be inedible and continued
having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework is just plain wrong
you could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do
if someone just moved from another town or state this will help them meet new people
instead they sit and play games on a computer
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
teachers parents children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit
computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you have missed as if you was absent
third it helps with school and work
it is eat to talk to other people forums chats websites and email
first reason of why i think computers have a positive affect on people is that they teach hand eye coordination
then the biker listened and he went on down the road
that is why the internet is very helpful
the one you love good past u way and you did not even spend time with he or she
you can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book
final reason is because the interact influences violence
to me computers are positive
censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for
dear local newspaper i think spending to much time on a computer is bad
just sitting there on the computer will get you
they can express their feelings in a way that is amazing
i read an article the other day about computer usage in 
not only are there books that i have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines movies and music
this shows a happy because they are welcoming people into there family
there is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to
libraries are a great resource for information all around the world
the author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings
search engines like or yahoo provide answers in less than one second
there is no reason to have a whole community ignore an authors work just because a large group of people do not agree with what it says
having cereals every day would keep us away from many illnesses
this game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world
whenever you need it
he or she could then use the computer to listen to music
this just shows how much the them and how thankful he is
the mood created in the memoir could be of happiness gratefulness and love
and that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word
kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects
censorship could take away your favorite series of books of the public library because of group of people thought it was offensive
where he is riding there is up and down hills also the road is very rough
this is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries
you make that decision
plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software
some always offend people for many reasons
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
the route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water
in all that i hope that i made a good point and hope you feel the same way
but i have and i also use to read them
after helping her find the  she ask  is this book so important to people
could there really be too much information
movies and books are different in many ways
they are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary
i believe computers are good thing but only if they are used properly
some say that you should just use a phone but you could use video chat on the internet
the heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast
do you look at your computer differently 
so get right up and decide
i do not believe that books regardless if one person deems them offensive should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on
the movie makes fun of the bad guys
personally i prefer horror movies but not gory because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next
my second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie
they could even have stuff that the young minds should not read
last and furthermore is movies where would we be without movies
so take a stand and end this reign for good stop the use of computers before it is too late
the heat because it drains your energy quick
friends always find something fresh to admire and appreciate each other
also having a nice family time is a good way to help be with your family
she also said in paragraph she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home
what will become of the uncertain future
she talks about how things should be taken of the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it
there are plenty of reasons someone want to do this
we swapped numbers and addresses
she is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring
those are my details to support my reason
it was time for school
it will benefit both sides of this argument
he says the old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road
he cares less for his books and more for his clothes and hairstyle
because moving was a very hard for her
lastly it is a great way to communicate with friends and family
another example would be the time i went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems
when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently
staying on all day sitting down rating
without the internet probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good
as you know forest are being chopped down and pollution is destroying our world
the setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake
because some people like stuff other people find offensive
computers are like little robots that control your mind and body it sucks the life cut of you
being able to chat with friends is one of the best
this would help you because at age people are dependent on computers
those are fun and great way to interact with your family
it was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty
computers help in a positive way
heed my advice  allow your kids the freedom of internet
when the ball goes right out of the parts
the ending almost repeats this line
do you think books magazines or movies that are offensive should be removed from the shelves stores and libraries
what can the general public do about this
so if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems
any of these websites can ford photos to their mobile device
she fastened me in and off we went back to the library
so here i am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society
they should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies video games and other things
this should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well
using the computer to go on multiple websites is actually easier
a library however is not just intended for adults teenagers or young children
even just typing is interesting for younger kids
i suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it
this goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored
the author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme
however when he realizes its old juice factory he grows bitter
a good half an hour later dad comes through the door with close behind
another reason is because there is some history on some websites
in my mind everything could possibly be offensive to someone
far as the music i agree with music at libraries because many people listen to different type of music
it really is magical
people need them to have an enjoyable life
one example from the book would be when they kill some of the children
we need to get up walk hang out with friends do sports
he had to go on thirsty a very risky thing to do while cycling because it had the flavor of battery acid
no need to worry you can just type that paper up on the computer
a person believe in something very strongly and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some way
this quote shows that she misses her own culture  cannot adapt to the one that she lives in now
they might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing
in conclusion it is a good idea to keep computers to use
without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade which is not as presentable
the cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted
therefore starting a fight
but instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun
these are all things that save lives
so to boost her confidence she decides to plant it
and i hope you like what i wrote
without the  the is just like any other country and has no direction
like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book its like taking away a good book from a reader
this is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way
for little kids i think that they should have things censored because there young
it helps me think what i am going and calms me down
are you going to let your child read that book
my third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising
i can relate this to my brother with his dis
what is offensive to one person be informative to another
throughout this memoir a very important mood is portrayed and that is thankfulness
these are just some of the great effects computers have on people
if this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt
everything is made with the help of machines
but when they read a book about a kid there age getting kidnapped they understand more clearly on the whys in life
i got up end did it too
when major things happen such as the earthquake in it was all over the internet before the news
other ways lived you could as
with computers it makes going green more possible
students should have the right to make choose what they want to read yet some people want to take that right away from students
could you imagine writing a newspaper a 
the computer enables people to stay entertained and relaxed when needed
do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers
the features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly
each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not so to censor books be to censor all individual mentality
i hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things
i hate arrogance also
in this show there is warning label stating only be seen to children and older
i believe that the books music movies magazines should be removed if they are really offensive
due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors
do they let everybody read it once
shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults
but there is a good side as well
if you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her
i strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves
its almost as though its taken this plant to show her to get back up and pass the test
he is in school from to pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer
they also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet
those are the noises of pinball on my computer
some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf
millions of spend countless hours with their eyes glued to  and monitor screens
but why keep them from the real world
therefore i support her sentiment
i understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help
and by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful
every mind that is among the world is extremely different just as every book is
many people are interested in these movies
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things i learned there about how to love
the world needs its materials
movies are located at libraries as well
censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing
we are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say
the library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for
it also has many games that and learn our vocab words
also could not think for themselves because the censored everything you could think of
but most importantly it is very unhealthy
an other reason why is educational is because you can type your paper on so your teacher can actually read your handwriting
an example might be religion
i noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others
and when many whites started to find out they begin to question the young man about how he dress and why
his family realized that buying him that computer was of the best ideas
people can speak believe and read what they want without the government interfering
also it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material
when i was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library
dear newspaper  there should be censorship in libraries but people should be a certain age just to check the book out
it even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library
then came along and made me a somebody
i wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess
people are spending too much time on computers
that means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be
for example  say you have a research project and you need to look someone up you go on the computer and you got him
if you have never played this before when you sign in it does some tests and determines the age of your body
on computers there are lots of games to play that are free
she had no control over it
as small children we should always obey elders and also respect each other
once it is gone it will be forgotten
so i want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it
it is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents
the people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others
this is why the hibiscus is so important to the story
so instead of you always watching the news or reading newspaper
it reminded her of how things were different
the reason for essay was to show why the process needs to be stop
computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation
a rich man without good health can not enjoy a good sleep
you can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away
while you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time
then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him
is the key to their future
and how much she loves them
you can ask people question
my second reason why has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying
first there are many families who have at least one member who lives in a different place
she is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus
first computers take time away from hobbies and friends
in addition parents have the responsibility to watch over their children
think about the situation that you might come across and can be offensive to you
this means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to
there are movies made for adults but how many adults let their kids watch them to
there are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime
the going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing
whenever your out to eat or shopping you can hear offensive comments or images all around you
it is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers
not spending time with your family and friends is an awful thing to do
soon many ladies came out of their houses and surrounded them
that is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues such as books on race or religion
do i believe that certain materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive
another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person
in some cases some media should be destroyed and hidden from public
the mood conveyed in the memoir is love
television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer
have you ever been one of those students who write their papers but get bad grades because their handwriting was messy
so all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them
i believe that book should be kept in order of age
the cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling
but a lot of people use computers almost everyday
this also with focus and people with better focus excel in school work and their social lives
aside from communication computer also greatly improve and learning in many ways
webcams hooked up to the computer let people talk face to face with someone else they might not have seen in months
i understand that some teenagers can be offended to drugs or killings in magazines or books but some people like reading about that kind of stuff
he had a very simple
this crushed her
so therefore it should not be any reason that the materials should be removed from the shelves
like not letting us dive are cars for stuff
make tomorrow be a better place than today
i personally think as a person who attends the library often that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways
there are many people in the world who like all different types of books
the mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house
words like ramshackle and rusty
a library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books
there going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway
so people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do there best work online
is cool because the computer help you in everything
freedom to chose is something every person can have such as what type of clothes you wear
you can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home
all these features of the setting affect him
i believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing
when he sees the sign it read rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
he talks about how his parents taught him how to cook
it eats small snakes lizards insects and seeds
the flower represents her and her driving test
throughout the world there are thousands of people with various opinions
she maintains the library very well
do you really want that happening to everyone
lastly mostly everybody has on the internet and would live to and with them while
i was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal
i have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference
secondly computers let you search the web
besides all of the good things computers do have bad qualities too
unfortunately it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world
the author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival
at that time i feel to embrace her
i have grown many kinds of flower plants in it
the rooms are wellventilated and wellfurnished
does censorship solve any problems
thank you for taking your time to read my opinion and i hope i helped
if people could limit their at risk for diabetes
if the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business
i personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to
this was my first experience of traveling by air
this way information is never censored completely
the features of the setting effected the cyclist very much
this creates hate inside of their hearts all because censorship was not used
the author says there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
if you take those away its like your trying to hold people back from education and knowledge that they have in books
they allow you to see places
the slave trade is a major part in history that helped shape the country it is today
computers have become a part our everyday life
this is said 
then they invite you to do activities and
i find  in the  to be dangerously inappropriate
thank you for reading my opinion
even schools use computers
most recent information i would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact
i think computers definitely have a positive affect on people in many ways
music or movies could be put in there own sections also
computers have been rapidly changing too
the computer is a major help
if he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water
computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world
soon the fire brigade arrived
these are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone
by its leg could even harm a horse or a man
lastly for a teenager or older they are more social than little children
the tumble weeds show a distinct desert look
form what i have seen someone want for example a book about taken off the shelf because they are and might not support their religious ways
so people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down
when the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth
also just to have everyone united as one and be thankful for my culture and it kind of makes me want to explore my culture and express it more
the driver of a car lost his balance at a turn
i am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem but there are some movies musicand magazines
that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
this means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not
it all really depends on the reader
our country based on a freedom of press and speech to deny that to deny our livelihood as a country
the people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive
learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted
the truth is we can not stop them their is so much of the pornography and bad music out in this world that your can get it anywhere
long distance friends can view photos information videos and chat from far away
also it is in the desert in the west so there is a very warm climate already
maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf
sure they might be on hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school meals and activities
there are also lot of different in what people want
the birds sing happily
most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe
there is always a smile on his face
this implies nature comforts her
while others don see a problem with it
however some people myself included have checked out or bought books and then realized what exactly was portrayed in those books
dear  i do believe that computers can be positive
one for  child family activity romance etc
this is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads
when a song artist comes up with a song there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs
try to make a difference
in the end he did make it and all it was worth it
some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen there is even something to prevent that
people go to the library because they want to either get away or just to be free and grab a nice book
so often today do we hear of books magazines and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views
you can also use webcam where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you
books are books and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf
those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
secondly the most concern parents have computers are the many dangers which is another negative effect it has on people
i sure would
they can help us learn new things we all can meet new people
then if i like it i start singing it
positive effects computers have  are that they are quick and reliable and they are fun to use
this is why computers are beneficial to the society
computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another
they have poisonous liquid is entered to the wound of it’s victim
computers also waste space
secondly why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner
in past years censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports
dear newspaper  has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society
i hope you agree with me on this
people build their character through their reactions of how people treat them
an instant message which can be used on any of the sites mentioned can also be achieved
the temperature caused the cyclist to sweat
he becomes delusional when he said that if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat
they are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others
most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways
now that information is only a few clicks away
it is found in our homegardens
books are for any reader that decides they want to go to that world
they work their tails off to produce new things for us
would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view
this can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right as well let them be aware of what life is about
plus the more people buy and use computers the more company are going to want to invent new ones
then the jokers came
of are employed as of  and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs or even keep their businesses open
thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs and 
i think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library
she was on it all day and all night
you thought that way you thought wrong
with all these hours wasted in the virtual world people are lacking in exercise leading to many problems
see now you heard it from the expert as well
there is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone
the physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story
but with computers they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors
if a person cannot think for themselves they cannot draw their own conclusions on things
birdie is light brown in colour
she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply
people gamble through online poker
there is a certain extant for movies and magazines
they are having a positive effect on people
that knowledge i had obtain then had helped me later on my 
computer very helpful when social life
if the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to removed asap
all you need in life is a little imagination and a lot a help and love
that type of book however should not be found in the library
i was one of the worst book that i have ever seen we left the library and never came back
dear local newspaper i think computers have a positive effect on people
these are simple and save lots of time
this is unfair for any student because this novel is inspiring and life changing so they are definitely missing out
i think is a positive effect on people
develops a grateful comforting caring mood
and discipline among the members of the society is of the greatest value
he had to save as much water as possible
then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her
then they all get very depressed
which i can understand why someone would want to escape
the setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going
dear  i have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often
they can also rent hotels movies and games
should be removed from the shelves
i found myself obsessed with it
books music movies and magazines are sold for this purpose
the music poses a problem though
computer time is fine in moderation you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it
we use search engines for everything everyday
there are lots of books about freedom fighters warriors kings etc
actually was a very good book
this is why using the internet will help you be the successful person that you want to be in life
lets make these profanities go away on their own
life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of
everyone can choose their own opinions
if you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me your wrong
dear news computers are a great machine to use
these people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls
of course anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it
the author created a mood in the memoir
this is my first reason
my first reason is computer teach you hand eye coordination
too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive
is there a place out there that you really want to know more about that you hope to someday visit
one thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it
in conclusion i strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf
until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts no matter what those thoughts were in any form of media
they were all proud and happy with everyone coming together as a family
on the news there has been reports about children being influenced to have a gun and hang themselves etc
they watch inappropriate movies when they should be watching something educational
different types of books explain different types of things
i believe that the is the most important book in the world
have you seen protests arouse before you
family is very important to most families now a days
when up got picture typed up paper saved our was empty
lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet
that is why i believe computers have a positive effect on people
i even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady
i think that computers are perfect and can help you build skills
all of these tiresome commercials
so with the computer computer
my opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time
computers help tech you things entertain you
another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water
the journey to shimla was very pleasant
censorship should not take part in any library
most not happen but there is a good chance that some of it will happen to someone in the world
i waited and waited for the dog to go but it remained there
i say happy because they had family to be with and other friends to help them if anything
think about it how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact
    or 
because its hot and hes tired he begins to see mirages that affect him
i think the computer is a great of learning
different people have different ambitions
it shows that she is persistent determined and strong willed
magazines are also used for different things such as comics housework as for ladies makeup perfume etc
people will start eating too much and so they will become lazy
children specially the younger ones like her very much
computers help students with homework and projects and they help communicate with other people
certain words help to better express people and their views
one reason is that we know she wont give up
it is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place
the books and magazines can give people some ideas of what they say or do and they can believe anything of what they say
children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did
it is still an open debate but in opinion censorship should not be done
if you like sports you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports
it helps with a lot of tasks these days
but if the reader is not reading for interest then there is a problem there
there was no one in sight not a building car or structures of any kind
my views on censorship are strong
anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it
that means that so many people need to resourced foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it
thank you for your time
easy as that
since are than our cable provider we were able to look up
he has thanked them many times
computers present job opportunities educational opportunities and a way to communicate with others
most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends
a sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat
this a whole lot of fun
i believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives
well on the computer you can talk online to your friends
lastly the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover after affects his performance
dear  in my own opinion computers do not have a positive effect on people
police are shown as stupid and slow and civil characters shine by contrast
the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affected the cyclist in the story
according to a recent study of citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet
his record company refused to produce his music under his name because of the scandalous lyrics
i think that computers are not as good as some people think
they can also talk about if they want to go some fun
to bring magic in you include carrot onions garlic and plenty of leafy vegetables in your diet
for example said i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary
the internet is for searching up all types of things
they are renewed in a symbolic sense
i would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read
people love movies
those are what i think are his moods and the reason for them
the mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house
one more good thing their is is that you learn things online about anything
in summary the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting
my second reason is you can stay fit while being on the computer
you can get a lot of good information on the internet but you can also get a lot of bad information
on search engines they have websites pictures movies maps and more
the author writes to tell people a story whether good or bad he or she wanted to get that story out there to inform people
for example elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries
the last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about love loyalty and friendship
less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day
for example the commercials for gum with that woman some people might consider that offensive
book censorship limits knowledge
were both online one day and i searched his name to see if he had an account
the slim margin of people who dislike what those people enjoy can just avoid reading watching or listening to it
also saying that she will wait till the spring means she is going to try again and not give up
if people want to read a certain magazine or book that offends a large sum of people then they should go somewhere besides a library to find it
i myself am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things i say
they also save important files and precious pictures
you can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet
we had a lot in common and i was glad to have made a friendship with 
once they lose hope they wont try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength
the principal read out the annual report
the first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders
so please make sure you try to spend time with your family
i believe that libraries should not have censorship
for example i know of many online colleges
also sometimes friends move away and you always want to keep in touch
thank you for listening to my reasons
he ends up drinking all of the water he has and needing to stop for some more
here is how the setting affected his mood
so why not have it in the books and movies
dear local newspaper 
he tells of the courage his mother and father had of coming to the country without any knowledge of the language or culture
but encounters a snake
right from the very early stages a dog is perhaps the only animal who has helped mankind the most
this can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way
first of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places people and the weather
in my opinion i think computers have a positive effect on people
i believe computers positive effect in people
when we read a classic we are in communication with a great mind and get a moral contentment
censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created
would you want your kid to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw
those advances have shaped our lives and made everything much easier
a certain amount of time can be plugged in
its there people want to read it
when trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from
why try to block out negative things when there all around you
lastly everyone reads on the internet about warming but why do we not take action
he opens the rooms
dear local newspaper back a couple decades ago before computers existed
the reason i know the mood was happy is because she had wonderful people in her life
so i would go with both sides
computers are a great way to do reports talk to friends  family  also to research things you have needed to know
in conclusion i state no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library
it is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age
for communication entertainment and school projects
it was a place from where we could see the entire valley
these are the reasons how the computer effects education your heath and your time
did you know that out of homes have at least computer in their home
first reason is that computers help people educate others
people that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children
whatever you do just get off your computer and go outside or the gym for exercise
if it has a good message to send to you will think about it
if something is that offensive to that many people they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like
remember how we used to have to read the newspaper to find out about breaking news and important things
all of the flowers reminded her home country
he makes sketches of big buildings
this reminds me of my cousin 
if libraries were censored more people would be upset
movies are also the same making it harder for younger children to see certain movies
she wants to go take the test again when she is stronger
i think that all libraries should carry the same content in them
it is quicker easier and that is why of finish their taxes online
censorship should not be allowed in libraries
most movies magazines music and books are considered offensive to at least one person in this world
i know not spending time exercising is bad but learning about new things cant be that bad
that way a person could go to a specific section and know what to expect from there
furthermore the author of the memoir expressed this by saying that his family turned this simple house into a home
also a computer can help unemployed people find a job
the features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclists anger
finally computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle
 the people agree with what stated
at first is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughters actions and feelings
they increase responsibility by giving you many choices
they can video chat talk look at peoples pitchers and keep updated with them on the computer
call me and we will talk this through
i love my classroom as well as my teachers
also the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things
so parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library
if we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything
in conclusion the setting clearly affects the cyclists journey in a negative way
my father explained to me that the sound was due to the landing and takeoff of the airplanes
such as political cartoon
whether those reasons are for education or for recreation the libraries have reasons for them
it would allow people to learn about places all over the world
there is however one other element at play here protection of youth and innocence
the first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills
now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with fiends and family
the situation is different for each person
they believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity which is where i stand on the situation
therefore kids act up in homes and at school
this memoir did however express a lot of feelings though
also it is important for children to get fresh air
with censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book
the choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents
also it is the best information database known to and is probably the most used
the author of this memoir created a mood about family
example with something possibly about someone being racist
shows so much love  thanks to his family  friends  his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph
the older sister is to busy looking for her own book
the created by the is happy was happy that got to live in and be raised in 
there are online college and online high school
if the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects
if you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures foods and more
we live in a generation where computers have become a necessity instead pleasure
last year we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster
stuff like that should not even be published in a public area
to me i honestly find computers useful because i can talk online to my family in 
the mood of the is happy
that report was done when they were fixed
there are a few reasons for this
as the story goes on there was no one in sight not a building a car or structure of any land
his troubles thirst  fear were all behind him when he saw that sign
they either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible
the computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away
i go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax
if parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children they should read the fine print
all it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more
kids fifteen and and older would understand
the world would be better off without computers
no i do not think they should take anything off the shelf
then take a mouthful of water face the sun and blow the water out as fine spray
after receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions
in the beginning of the essay the cyclist rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on his face
this would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land
sometimes good friends who wants to together loss touch or if one friend people can find online and take
i cursed my fate
other articles that have no reason for being offensive should be taken off shelves
secondly i think that computers are important is because they help with learning even online schooling
there is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed
definitely read on to see what computers can too
a short film with a crop story and colouful atmosphere creates the desired effect without much words
another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch
as the effect of that the cyclist had to drink a lot of water
so people who publish the newspaper i think and i hope you think to this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer
they become fat
the messages are all the same in each type of media sex drugs and violence
my three reason why you should have a computer is you can talk online with your friend or do homework or project and fine out things out
for example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also
let it go and stick to what you know and like
the book i am reading now is about a murder of a young girl
the fact that something could be banned for something so trivial is a frightening thought
if we decided to allow this would there even be books movies music or even magazines for us
also gives me about a college that i would and like to attend to
the next type 
the cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town
children will see and hear offensive things anyways
the law of censorship is usually broken in libraries
well we can do something about that
a third reason people should not use computer is because they stop interacting with real people
as i anxiously started reading my book i found language drug abuse and sexual content
as you can see there are many ways to learn from having computer
in conclusion computer have helped a lot to people because you can shop online communicate and learn  overall computer have really changed lives for most citizen
because the girl is willing to try again and to not give up no matter what
no i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive
that was what i thought about when i was tempted to actually remove them
but why so many
if we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking books off the self
is grateful that he had the parents he did
flying high i can enjoy the fresh breeze and watch the beautiful sunset from the top
first off computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you
people can meet new people learn about new places and talk to friends
however none or which help these people get or stay healthy and in shape
it can be done with the help of the mortar and pestle
why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids
for some students the holidays mean more work
if the parents are scared of there children being able to rent these things they need to put some sort of block on them
with the positive aspects there is always a negative
i think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world
however these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries
with a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep
of all he explains how much his house meant to him
the fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips
we live in  which since founded has been all about freedom
those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful
i look at this like its a little deal
is a good place to get computers so is t
i believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online
everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it
word is not acceptable today and therefore people take offense to his work
some argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf but i beg to differ
and how thing change when you go to different place
the features of the setting including vast emptiness hills heat and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in do not exceed posted speed limit
this law was enacted in the of and is still in effect today
everything is useful and everything has at least some sort of positive effect coming out or it
this book is one of my top five favorite books and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned
when people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not 
libraries are for children and adults of all ages
the pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves
so computers are very popular in many areas computers are helpful in news communication and entertainment
internet helps people in meany ways
for example in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is
did you know that adults learn their knowledge about the environment politics and other basic information from the computer
one important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is it takes away our freedom of speech
that the parents fault
did you know that the human body has only one liver
lastly they save us money everyday
finally computers allow people to talk online
the only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that
he even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water
he will need water in all to move and get through his journey
take for example a book about 
computers also broadcast news
my uncle is one of those people
computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives
having many different kinds of people sharing this material the libraries must try to have material to please everyone
it has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today
then they would get in trouble
for instance say you wanted to talk to a friend in  all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them
then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day
in the results of them not reading anymore
the rest room toilets parcel room and the canteen are few
also i learned to type with type to learn 
thank you very much
if a material offends one person is that sufficient enough to exclude it or do you need a larger group
i personally prefer to type than write but that is just me
censorship in libraries the library presents to the community many different things for entertainment
offensive books 
dear newspaper i think that computers have a good effect on peoples lives
when he saw the fish bate shop though he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved
censorship is greatly inferior to proper life lessons about morality equality peace and respect
it could also let them communicate
i hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them
many people claim that certain books should be allowed on shelves
my grandfather has great knowledge about history
when it comes to libraries there are very few materials that should be banned
the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh 
my first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project
computers make this a whole lot easier on us
the last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh
the setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker
life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products
now i can see how books are an excellent resource in society and how they provide for amazing information however it takes years to publish books
one section for kids one section for teenagers one section for adults and one section for middle aged people
if you think about it they can actually help you learn with all those different programs they have
if everyone would throw away books that were offensive there would be no books left
instead of typing away we should explore the world and learn important things
there are brown patches on its body
your body needs fresh air so start enjoying your life a little more people
the desert environment is very unforgiving
she was still too shaky to say at home she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up
i hope you take my advice and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort
he ended up getting a on the test because he used a computer
she can climb the treesshe likes to play in my bed
books music and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet
there is and like i said before you can even chat on social networking sites
if the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such that could mean things
the cyclist just thought his life got a little easier
it helps people think of new ideas
both parties in case are still able to say and express their own opinions
in the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist

if he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration he was pretty thirsty
also is a family come up you could your family members instead of calling them because they would talk to you forever
if they had a computer and playing games or talking to friends they would be like they are
there is no bad effect of computers
help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others
there are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people
this would not be fair to those who enjoy these kind of materials
that is normal thing that will up on computers they can give you viruses and people can get your personal information
computers are killing us as a nation
another thing you can do is learn about recent events
a library has books on nearly all subjects
both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike
there are many great activities you can do such as reading a book
computers help other people learn about far away places
also chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch
other experts disagree
for example how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems
she loved her old home but she realized it was time to move on
in the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think
some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place

so school went by the bell rang it was time to go
many different people have different views of different kinds of books
i love talking to friends
kids are failing in school because they fail to do their home work after school
in the  there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information
music is music and it is there to be listened too
there is beautiful nature outside
leave the libraries books on the shelves no matter what is in them
these are reasons why i think they should be able to censor books music movies and also magazines
in other peoples eyes you find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences
they make us lazy
computers also help us to send emergency messages across the world in 
i would give due place to cocurricular activities
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain
kids watch movies in class all the time
keeping all the materials like books music movies etc is a way to appeal for everyone
the sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point
not all people are the same and not all books or magazines are the same
i tell him to pick a book and come on
the features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist
playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better well keep you busy
what you can find online still amazes me
computers are a great source of information
in a normal society learning leads to questioning
a complete citizens and drives them from family and friends
many books movies and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children
another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational
so the more information we take off of the shelves the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems
it really makes one look back and see how much their parents have done for them
also no one has time to enjoy nature
the way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible
they are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in
you take it as it is being independent
school work is a very important thing in teenagers lives and i feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities
should there be censorship in libraries
this means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused
you can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper
if they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves
computers are advancing and so are their uses computers are great and they are not our thought process or went to run around outside and play sports
the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip
there is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store
also he had to keep dehydrate
my mother goes there on some occasions like to get information from a book or a computer
some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water
parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not
for example playing sports or even a simple task like throwing something in the trash
with all this new  quicker stuff you can talk to friend when ever you want
they should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends
she have thought if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing than she can make it through the test
if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life
it is so much easier to do that then look for books that has all the facts you need
to begin computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise
he not only makes local calls but also trunk calls and does not think necessary to pay for them
in the end libraries should consider censoring their books or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints take it off the shelves completely
until finally he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom
there should not be a certain kinds of books in the library
why not talk to real people
overall the things that we read watch and listen to not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it
where would we be without a computer to help
average people like me and you need to know the weather global issues and many other important topics
i believe that books music movies magazines or anything else should not be removed if they are found offensive to anybody
the library is where they get the books from
the public suffers and their own work also suffers
a lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard
computers are great for people of all ages
the mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be i believe love
religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves
last computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics
just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups
without this technology where would we be
the author states gaining elevation while loosing hope
first people have different views on what they find offensive
it also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need
in a way books are both bad and good
another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area
it is understandable to have a little tone in the with some knowledge within the eyes in a book
this bad of help can male school projects easier make students be even smaller and give opportunity to help in need
dear local newspaper the years computers has been a great invention
it makes viewing more interesting and exciting
among those effects are ease of communication ease of gathering information and ease of find entertainment
all my friends were also invitedi was very happy to see them
or if you wanted to know when died
computers can expand on many peoples opportunities for education
to solve the problem everything should not be censored
computers also do the same thing for music
they make fun of them because they are not like others and they can take that very offensive
the setting in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit is used as an important for character development
after an hour’s drive we reached the zoo
he starts off describing his life so far and family
well first of all why do we even want to watch see or listen to things that are not right
i have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online
the kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away
the can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know
i believe that the hibiscus and the drivers test are relevant like the blooming of a flower
a safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the or people claim them to be
i could never make anything to his satisfaction
the setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help
see the world through their own eyes
with not them the parents should their child to and from the library and the time
is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the language
this is why people should agree that advance in technology
however that some of the websites are fake which is easy to great research to use for school projects
think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of other
a couple years ago i can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head
they could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong
the gurus of ancient era are now addressed by ‘sir’ or the last name
people can learn bout things places even their own family
everyone has their own opinion as do i and i believe it should be allowed
a lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate especially rap music
computers can give many chances for exploring education
you should look at your own life and think about what you find offensive
how do you graph linear equations
he then faced his next problem
so if the parent buys the child that that is bad it is the parents fault
lastly computers are doing more then good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy
some people believe that in some instances it is perfectly fine but others disagree
many people can be smeared on the internet as well
she is setting a real goal for herself
its take it to even an different level with to male gender 
people who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants
last customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make
farmers need water for cultivation
you know that most adults use an online dictionary to find the definition to a word
was a musician composer writer public speaker and human activist
its to do school work and talk to family
as we have the choice to read what we want to authors have a choice on what they want to write about
there are people that love writing about violence gore and segregation
my last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could effect your education
so i think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again
i believe censorship should be illegal not required
is the censorship in libraries really necessary
i do hope that in the future we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over reaction to something offensive
i know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time
but i think that is wrong
the considered everyone family even though the times were not the greatest for everyone also his parents gave up a lot so he could have a good life in 
one example of being offensive in a good way is the book 
i firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect
if you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences then do not put it on a public display
in conclusion i feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without
he was a tall frail looking man who commanded respect
i hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive you think about this
floods are natural calamity and take place regularly in certain areas
if you said to all of these questions then using a computer is the way to go
such was the time of peace there
the man was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
they let people talk online
also being able to look up school work with
people have classes online they go to mothers that are single that have kids for example they get their diplomas and degrees of the computer online
did you know that most kids communicate online now
the book should not be put away for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs
you can learn about new things like people and places far away
but i started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer
our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced
at first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had a smile on
we have a great number of other things you can pick from
a second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places
also adults use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library
what if did not invent the telephone
books are not excluded from this rule
to add insult to injury they often befooled me and made me a target of their jokes
computers are the easiest way to look up information something important when children are learning
what happens when are forced out into the real world and cant really do anything
i personally think that is good for most kids
i have to admit i have watched listened to and looked at some bad stuff but i regret it all so very much so
the hibiscus plant in this story is like a symbol
people should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it
i love to read during the day
the whole human ace would be in chaos
computers are very troublesome
he is terrified
i am going to tell you all of the reasons i think the books should stay on the shelves
it keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school
i do not think other people who actually enjoy reading and listening to that stuff if they are happy then so be it then they are happy
especially kids should be outside playing and exercising
he created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate
if someone finds it offensive they should simply not read it
no i do not believe that booksmusic and etc
which could cause him to lose the will to carry on
i don know why these books are even needed in a library
this could be a curfew fake elections or censorship
dear local newspaper have you ever gone somewhere taken pictures and posted them on the computer
before he became buddha his name was siddhartha
about their kids what happens if they want to playing they have nothing also to do card their
very hot the water was also degrees
i support the advances in technology
to each person that finds the material offensive there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all
paragraph 
i believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries
it was very helpful
he biked to the first town but it was like a ghost town
yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like hibiscus
i know that books help me figure out many things
dear  people think that computers are used too much and are helping people become over weight and even obese
your no enjoying nature
this student should have no better source for information than a library
dear  recently has been brought to my attention that computers have been affecting peoples daily lives
first he says how grateful he is for the customs passed down to him
the librarians or a national book association could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age
plus not all information you find is true
i think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends
if not for the amazing of computers that me back i would still do exercise only to after about a week
because you can learn it easier with different under standing it better so you
books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people
it should be read
computers are sucking in society more of it each day
say a child around the age of is listening to the new  song
if you need direction you can print them out off the internet
the next person after me
anything can make someone change and in order to have that chance we should have the freedom to read what ever we would like
multiple servers proud 
dear local newspaper computers have a positive effect on people
it also helps us do better on projects
she walks home and finds a hibiscus
people kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online
if there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library
lastly some bad things can be shown and can happen while online
it allows you access to websites that help you talk to new and dd friends
in conclusion i believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book movie or off of a shelf is not very smart
it becomes very pleasant and cool
generally children should be running around burning off their calories even some people in their teen years should
one time i was wondering what people from did to live and survive
some people might not care about the things they see and some do
the library is full of many books for all ages
i think computers have great effects on people like going online to do a research or talk to friends
for example i personally love horror movies
the memoir expresses a positive mood and their are no signs at all of negativity throughout the memoir
not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials
it has changed the content on our television from years ago to modern day
computers are making this happen
when my mom saw the show she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content
i professionals say that of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false
i wonder why people disagree and i hope that after reading this you will too
i believe that agrees
so that shows that the computer can be fun but also dangerous
the cyclist has it hard in the conditions lack of water heat and rough terrain are all things that made his ride harder
finally it gives ability to 
it be offensive to you but other people not think the same way
you can also put all your information online and you not think a lot of when they really do
 the mood of this memoir is defining the love of his family
she walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home
i say no
i do not think so
so i deleted the account
this really improves students grades because they had more resources and more information to choose from instead of only the information in the book
others do not
music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves
or your family can be having a movie night and your on the computer while they leave
dear of the  has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse
there are different favorites likes dislikes and opinions
these books in my opinion can only help them
you can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park
you can help us by taking all of the bad words and offensive words of the books movies and magazines
seven out of ten teenagers rather be inside in the computer talking to people rather then meeting new people elsewhere
more often then not i enjoy reading what i enjoy far more than something that is forced
a computer also has many great sources you can learn from like an online website that has fun called 
information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by including video games
some people be interested in these topics
when she left her home she did not just leave a building behind
some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice
seven years later he was able to send radio signal halfway around the world
where did they hear from
there are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school
also when a teacher a sighs a project on someone your going to need a computer to search up information for that person
it the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning
by warmth she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones
all in all  having computers is a great investment
you are given technology advantage so why not use it
many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside
how about you
takes two seconds
that is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip
there are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch like instant messaging systems mentioned before
this quot was found in  this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous
a person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song or book without getting disrespected and offended
that is why i think that you can work on the computer
therefore the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting
in their the world they will be able to do this on computer
there is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked back in the day and how things were done
i feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material
online predators lurk as many comers and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen
next there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely
clearly the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives
people that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out
some of the family members they would have were grandparents aunts  and cousins
if certain offensive things were taken off of the shelves of libraries such as music books etc
i do watch them but i would never watch them around my younger sister
the internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas
the bad part is that if your on the computer all the time then you are neglecting time with family and friends
he carries the letters in his bag
so without computers i would practically never see my brother or talk to him
a convenient way to do this was by using a computer
additionally the whole fact of contacting others around the globe as well as having a whole fun world to explore makes computers more enjoyable
it is easier than the hassle crowded malls and long lines
there would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out
books are the basic learning methods of education
well lets get started
also no one is in sight
he writes about his parents in a way that informs the reader that they were extremely good people
lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving
i think that they should have any an every kind of book magazine an movie you want at the library
he setting made the cyclist feel lonely
parents can just decide they want their kids to read watch or listen to
it makes you think of your own family
now lets talk about something
also if it was or to me i would the use of computers
if books were censored the quality of learning would not be the same
this paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers
they live in a beautiful house that has bedrooms
i feel strongly about people knowing about the worlds past
one of the biggest concerns is that the freedom of speech is taken away
also there is no buildings people or cars in sight to save him
if people choose to let their children read books then that is fine with me
now can you see how much the computer benefits society
that means that project should be real easy
that one second’s care might have won him a prize
in this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is
get off you computers and go outside
when you are on a computer have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan
you can still interact with your family and friends either in chat or 
next is how computer could benefit our society
my last reason is this technology can be a good way of protecting this country
to a is a big target for censorship but it is about treating everyone fairly
ramzan is a big religious festival
children do not choose their parents
now you can use this technology as a tool not a game
also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time
i will be talking about do think books music or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive
libraries are a wonderful place full of great stories and adventures so they should not be polluted with offensive and inappropriate material
this is why books and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the 
why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country
i also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read
my mother made hot tomato soup for us
finally the computer is great for playing about every game there is that you would feel like playing
the heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey
however sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books
no one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently
in this way among the men and the cats has a big relationship
is an example of keeping in town with someone else
milk is not only important for growing children but also for people of all age groups
computers are very helpful at learning new things
it just depends on how society feels about the whole situation
not everybody is true over the computer
the only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands
everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story
communication is another aspect of our lives
they have for legs and a small tail
they enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies
i would be mad if i came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer
those kinds of music must be remove from any school library or any public library
you wont be able to see how big your family is
i know from personal experiences that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people
the venue was looking beautiful with flowers and lights everywhere
computers are one of these great benefits
the only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him
he thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned
by now you that i would like to
the surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence
the computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person
an empty room
the ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out
the hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
he mounted on his faithful horse kanthaka and reached the bank of the river yamuna
when the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes he is both mentally and physically exhausted
maybe but all depends on who you are and angers you
we all know that is garbage
in spring the nights are cold but the days are sunny
hindus clean and decorate their houses
people spend too much time using the internet than exercising nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature and there is less interaction with family and friends
dear  i strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer
a lot of today are censored because of the content in books music movies and magazines
you can search and get information
the cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads
he tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid
also a study by the has shown that there are roughly fewer conversations at social gatherings than just 
also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material
you can talk or web chat with friends
he is softspoken
what a pain
some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society
the library has educational movies for children that not be available anywhere else
spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good
if all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library would there really be anything left
how do we know we got a good book
the reasons listed above tell you why i believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose
if it survives she knows that she too will survive and life goes on
from video games to movies and even most books now
i most people would feel bad
your with your family your supposed to spend time with them
just pick a book that has a theme you like
everyone has that right so i do not think that companies have the right to take that away from them
with computers we have enough for each kid in the class
for example he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go
the same way goes for a magazine also
remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story  the 
and items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area
well now you can in the comfort of your own home
as he was riding he said flat road was replace by short rolling hills
i would never watch or anything like but my friends who have watched have learned something
plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism or someone being overweight
a final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature
everyone has different taste in movies music books etc
the family spends no time together what so ever
no matter how much your teacher explains to you just seems like there are speaking another language
one way is for school
computers are positive because of the new technology
as citizens we have the right to free speech
but when they here that word or read about something or watch
some people seem that it might be cool to be just like her
there is nothing that can be done its over with
this park is just a short distance from my house
exercise is a main way of staying healthy
so take a part  contact your local newspaper today
they do not have to read these books it does not affect them
so who is to say what offends people and what does not
he is in the middle of nowhere
instead of sitting around doing nothing people can go on the computer and to many activities
you need to change something for a paper it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over
a definite and timely action at that moment is very important
mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show
lastly computers are a way of contacting others
failing her drives test was hard for her
who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays
theses books all have history in them of our past
the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail
when he comes out a man is sitting on the porch
you can in with a friend that is out of state or you can talk with a person out of this country
computers are very entertaining
never in your life have you seen an 
she is tan
since i was the youngest i was also the shortest
book has a lot of bad words sexual scenes drugs gang violence racism
there are so many ways to do such as email or many of the social networking websites
nobody can force you to do anything of that nature
workers use computers for designing filing peoples names and to type papers and essays
they should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material
he started getting a little doubtful with himself as well that wont help much with bringing success of the trip
is your choice in the end but not all people have the same tastes in books music movies magazines etc
he showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong
if you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section
well if not then when you are not busy you should try it
unfortunately this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom
like the examples in the passage above
everyone is entitled to their own opinion but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended
that is why i have written this letter to you
an art book
it is so the kids can expand there imagination as well
 this shows the happy times they had together
i remember a time when i read a book and it had some really offensive things about homeless people
it dose not really mater to me we all have the wright to are one likes and dislikes
her mother forgot and read that book
censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish
just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college
others see it as freedom of speech and writing
he had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out
it also holds information on past and current events

after all who could pass up the opportunity to better prepare yourself for life

going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone anywhere type anything needed or to use the internet
next you can find information about everyday life

opinions of some books and media type materials are biased
the last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family
you my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show of people who do reports find their facts on the internet

in my opinion computers make things easier
you might create a book a song or a movie that will offend someone in a way

one reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of 
well i know it would me if it was are wedding song
these are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library
do you think libraries should have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find it offensive

this idea relates to my first idea but i will speak some of it again
when the cyclist is going on his trip he is riding through as desert

but if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing
so even know you can communicate with your friends
the outcome of that is success
they also hold your information
everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike
informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge

people like to go there to read book get on the computers and do activities with their families
and like i said before they really not bad there like a little guide to many people

computers benefit society because they help the earth and are a fast way to spread important information

i would let him read it to learn about the past
we as people should not be able to take this right away from other people
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
if it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves then what would be left on them
for example my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer
if your not going to find a book there why go to the library anymore
people can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or illegal things
however i do not think that the books magazines etc
they are published in many languages
the most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy
during the spring season we can work for more time
people might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out

dear local newspaper i hear that you think computers have an effect on people
will that be the next thing that is censored
this is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route you can even print a map and go hiking
after a wile you will forget about it
one thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre so that way people know what they are looking for
in conclusion the authors sets a very sweet inviting mood by adding details of how joyful and enjoyable his childhood was
it was to the point of dying
he speaks to everyone and is generous and kind
this quote about forty miles in the pedal i arrived as my first town
computers are very helpful especially today with everything going on in our world
i believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary but i also feel it must be kept in check
if this is true i certainly thing we should censor we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library
if we get rid of every single book that offends people then we are not going to have many books left and without books we have nothing
going to the library is just as useful if not more useful than going on the internet
the features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally physically positively and negatively
the internet allows us to communicate with friends family and more people around the globe
if you say something to the parrot it listens to it carefully and learns it well soon

however are some books just too much to handle and should not be read
of course every parent wants to protect their child but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices
you say you are going to play for minutes but they are so addicting you play for hours

basketball is played between two teams
over the years it has become harder to censor magazines
she also stopped reading the bible in her spare time to go on the internet
there were hills and rocks snakes and no buildings or people
the second reason why i think using a computer is good is because some jobs you have to apply by computer
getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence
some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity
if only certain people are going to complain about it its not really a big deal
you could buy tickets shop talk with friends and have fun just by sitting on a 
computers are only helping in aid in the growth of society
they also allow us to type assignments and other important papers
the computer is like a drug you can get on the computer one time then your just going to want to stay on ti everyday all day
but then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things
not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves offended parties can just simply avoid the book
there are many things said in the memoir that express the mood of love
for example when i say games i mean educational games like reading games math games writing games etc
than when he came to all the bumps in the road it was harder to pedal
a while back my family and i were trying to plan a trip to to visit
it can help you find a job
my imaginary friend is a user in my imagination
s they had no problem finding a home
your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong
i you to be in of negative effects on people
if everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate do you think there would be any books left
as editor of the newspaper you have the power to inform people about situations
finally the computer is an important resource because you can chat with your friends
to her the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives she knows that she too can survive
libraries are one of the number one resources when researching reading or gaining information and knowledge
next i feel that if your constantly on the computer then your parents will have an extremely high light bill
the terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition
it can even take a project on a flash drive and then download it
taking them away would only take away from the number of people who visit the library
computers really are the best electronic in the world
its for your own good
all libraries have books for all readers no matter the age
in doing this will connect to other ways of life
the queue was broken
this means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water
all this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad
this is not a good idea for spending the holidays
so that computers giving you this ability to learn about faraway places is really helpful to the human society
first you can learn about places you want to go to
computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends
another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes
those are my three reasons
so gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do
i will try to solve all the difficulties of my students
you can also to see a love one that you miss
now on to more about how computer are good to society
actually she is very kind to me and rest of the family members
computer dead is a term i call when all we want to do is use the computer
with out any doubt there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread through out the thousands of books and magazines a library holds
but another reason is that begging has become quite a paying profession
it has a lot of hills which would make him use more energy
these are the people that just sit on the computer all day
take the book from them
that choice is up to not to read the magazine not to the librarian
old people he thought he was getting a good shortcut
censorship lies within the hands of the viewer
one night she had so much hope like abundance then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home
so people should do some of the other things i said instead of just going on the computer all of the time
there are so many different types and styles of music
if it is a child their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child
his mother is a teacher
say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting i would still be able to write it and sell it
another example is communication
second the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired
each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun
i hope you agree with me also and should think that computer technology is a good idea for everyday for lots of reasons
i own a very good map
if there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand he or she get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject
another thing you can do it get online for how to stay healthy and exercise
computers are learning more and more advanced everyday
i have many friends in school with whom i play during my lunch break
the hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated
when reading this story you can really tell that this family was happy
also should be socializing with friend
they are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms
we have to nurse it well
the setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist
i would wellequip the laboratories
each book out there has an explanation a title and a reason to be read
first people spend less time exercising
later however his determination was fading as he realized that his short cut was not so short after all
will take a few hours but you will be educated
though my information is that both of them were as ordinary as i was
it represents the ability to overcome obstacles connection to the past and comfort when needed
more than half the time the internet has beyond enough information for what i need
everyone knows that family comes before everything
the condition of the roads adds on to the hills
to him this simple bait shop was like beacon of hope from food himself
i told my mother that i do not remember anything
that is how the mood created in the memoir to me was grateful happy and mostly thankful
my concern is for the children who get a hold of these books
the charmer was a middleaged man
in brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities media economics and our constitutional rights
when the burned the books we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature
yeah on playing counter strike
what then will they have to read
history is bond to repeat itself right
although they use computers for a good reason people should make time for outside
for example my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer
no one will ever agree on the same things but in the end we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community
or do you ever have time to go outside
but there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying
or not all day on the computer
to sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination
many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely
but materials be removed if it is sexual racist or life threatening offense
libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves
he should talk less and work more
the television is an improvement on the radio
majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true
without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression
computers are a great source of entertainment
the reader should be prompted on what books they read before doing so
computers update you on world news
keep reading for more information
there are so many books out there and odds are there is always going to be a book that offends someone
in the spring all the flowers start to bud and bloom
even if we do this there could always still be away
we shouted at the top of our voices
people are becoming addicted to computers
this makes travel to and from school much easier
in conclusion computers keep you from spending time with your family has students misspelling words and distracting you from doing your homework
sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen
art should never be censored for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society
of course its speed was reduced
everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world and no one is necessarily right
no it does not because it actually helps us
another topic is magazines
these words and actions we try to censor are not going away
how many of you out there absolutely love to read
overall i think they should keep the offensive materials
i do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that
the opposite situation for books we have them now but when they are taken we will want them even more
unplug yourself from your computer
so what do you think should this be such a law
if all books had to be appropriate for every age it would take all the interesting out of everything
people use the computer for school work
first when he got to the road sign that said rough road ahead he was already low on water but that made things much worse
also talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet
i feel the exact same way and someone should put a stop to this
that she could just walk knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her
no computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often
they all brought gifts for me
there are many different arguments about this subject
could tell that his parents love him very much and is grateful for that
and its whatever they believe in is how it should go
he never gets irritated and does his best for the sick
many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them
but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town
we put all of our knowledge into them even hundreds if not thousands of years ago
each book and even magazine has a fact of information regarding what is either happening in the world or what could happen
people like their options to be open and at a wide range
next the benefits it has to society is people can learn things online
if she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society
you never what might find out
as you can see the mood of the story is warm and tells us about how he had a good childhood
have such a good lifestyle for them do you want to feel guilty for ruining that
unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive it should be able to remain open to the public
but for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard
magazines that are bad should be taken off the shelf
from my observations with my little brother my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games
today you just have to go onto and type it out
floods also bring out the worst in men to the fore
most of all remember how much you can achieve with a computer
when you could simply go online and look it up on the computer
the television is a great gift of modern science
most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening
my aunt gave me and album of stamps on my birthday
what would you do if you picked up a book where someone is being teased about their looks and 
another reason is it shows how confident this experience has made her
he has to maintain law and order
there is really no reason for them to looking at it at all
you see how skinny she is
so this is why i think computers are a good thing
kids around the country are being killed raped and bulled to computers
some students copy in the examination
you can be talking on video chat with someone from another country and guess what
if you have kids you know you only want the best in their present  future
kid end up getting bad grade because they spend time on the computer
i think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not keep it
 one of my neighbors
the person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not
do you agree with me that we should be aloud to read listen to or view what we want
after all the children are the future of our world
the author concludes with this paragraph to give a sense at hope and growth
there was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had
the game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done
this is how the setting affected him
if you find something to be offensive all that you have to do is not check the book or other material out
so all you computer lovers get off and have some fun being outside with friends your family
although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles
a lot of jobs require people to be on the computer
the cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip
the problem is is that each families limits and values are unique we cannot just assume anything about families in general
we can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal because their could be reasons why things are where they are
one of those rights is the freedom of speech or the right to voice your opinion
if i brought over and read it to their kids and they got offended should we get rid of 
censorship of anything makes a child more immature
i over heard two girls talking
my grandma said to my mom
i feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster
the only place you can find a giraffe is if you go on the computer and search a giraffe
whether it be magazines books newspapers movies or music
in the middle of no where that is a problem
many take great offense at the use of this word
the water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips
to  computers are a benefit to our society
censorship only causes curiosity
as for reading materials the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear
lastly computers allow people to communicate through internet
that is the law and i believe this is a good thing
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime
it could also help save our planet by saving the energy
 and physically by becoming dehydrated
my address was also posted because that message was a mobile upload
movies can also inspire different people to do different thing such as become an actor also
just like kids they go on the computer to just play games
to forget is to remember at another time
 there were snakes in the road which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit
today more than of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer
his parents gave up their jobs and had to start their lives over entirely
this person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did
if a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them then they might think violent behavior is all right
to take one book away is to take all of them away
according to a survey done by the only of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week
dear more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
another thing that could be but not entirely removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts
 computers are great tools and a great piece of modern technology
the features of the setting affects the cyclist
love positive messages influencing good these are the types of things most people want to hear or read
but you most likely are going to need a credit card
if all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers
it was dusk
the first reason i thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there
am i right
this creatively loving setting gives the reader a sense of comfort when reading the piece
the media is destroying our youth
my third reason is finding out things
are we going to take those books out to
i am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody
for instance in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations

so i think computers are not a bad idea or a bad things
now the computer is also profitable
their are plenty of rated movies that have won and plenty of other rewards
your town have a gym community center or a library
how could you just take that away
yes books magazines movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive
in doing so the library i believe will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it
those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends
nine out of schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine

you could mess up someones family of living
this issue is debatable but really i think that computers are not helping the big picture
next computers allow us to talk to faraway friends or family
helping the user get the most satisfaction
there are not any kind of books that could be deemed offensive in any way to people these days
or at least your children have
censorship should be a matter of the private not public sphere
i only get to see him because a lot of money to come
the water was taken out of the man’s belly
so as i ask again what be offensive in libraries
if the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings then so can she
it was very beautiful and peaceful
musicians also play music of course
it would be bad if they were all gone
my hobby is drawing
language helps to set the time period in the novels
kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world
sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging
also lastly it less your hand
he was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves
the more smart you become overall
i quickly realized the computer is a tool used only when necessary
the features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert
dear local newspaper i think that computers are a good thing to have for the following three reasons
i like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive
the settings have a huge affect on the cyclist
my own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away
keep reading to find out more
and the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves
next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water
he explains his parents doings
computers are consuming the lives of everyone

the mood that was set was about how you should keep peace in the house
in conclusion computers provide an abundances of uses
get up and prevent the negative effects of computers
reading is in individual task
i have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship
he gets joy in floating paper boats
uploading family pictures from your last vacation
i can type with my eyes closed
however on the other side of the library there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house
if they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it
we as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions
 out people are obese
for example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it
every year thousands of students go to college and thousands of families move away from each other
the features of the setting of do not exceed posted speed limit greatly impact the cyclist in a negative way
sister also helps me to nurse them in the evenings
the journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one
i am against censorship in libraries and i hope you are too
its part of life
can we turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to
before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated
we all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives and we need education
rough road ahead
my mother took me into the library and i found a book a 
it protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age
in the where eats the apple from the tree and that is why we sin
you could learn how to do things or learn more information about a certain item
songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about
another opportunity that could be helpful on a computer is the ability to interact with other people
then no one would be able to find books about their religion and no one would benefit
i have just realized that you can pretty much do anything you want on a computer
there are many types of music out in the real world
you need your daily intake of oxygen
but you need to build a strong relationship with your family in order for them to be there for you
now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people
when the author says how his parents cooking was passed on to him he cuts away from the article specifically to thank his parents
this is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age
so when he tries to memorize a part of the  he cannot retain what he has been reading
or you could ask yourself what does it really solve
many people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass
a song can a as much as it can take one away
i know i do
when it comes to libraries it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions
people have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong
this good for larger benefit of society
the second son is of my age and studies in a public school
with music if there is a bad word the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange
remember that the computer be great from time to time but it can not live your life for you
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills is a main problem the cyclist faced
i agree in away too
some people might think that computers are a waste of time
he began to feel discouraged when he passed the grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him
i think that when old enough they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive
how would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided
at times they are brutally crippled made lame blind etc
you can clearly see how we are growing less energetic and much more careless of our time
this area could be created for adult or mature readers viewers or listeners
so say when my mom is working or me and my sister are researching something we learn
so then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth
after school hours i came home with sorrow and anger
they reward him for his good service in festivals
further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and gratitude
well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model
i use crayons pencils colour pencils etc
it does this with the mouse you have to be very coordinated to be good at the games on the computer
we need to know what is going on around us all the time
not even curse words
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers
her parents care about others and keep there doors open for them at all times
another statistic should that you know and use computers you would live longer and happier
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills
people will watch listen read anything
which has been proven by news
the authors family in their home people that they considered family this right here is a mood well a caring mood
in almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative
plus the library is a good place to just go look for music you like
i think this because yes people do play the computer to much but they can also learn a lot of things
these feelings are subjective almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate
the cyclist thought it was hard
for example in the text it says that he staggered into the store
it was a movement of nonviolance
then you had to wait at least weeks before your pen pal wrote back
he sees everything as the old men told him
moreover computers are chock full of information
yet students manage to play
last sunday a cricket match was played between our school team and the team of sd
not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance but that is why the goes around
according to about of teens spend most of their time on an computer
computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society
we all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits
the mood in this memoir is very strong
some other books though are meant for educational use and not meant to offend anyone
finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist
there immune system making the risk of getting sick greater
a local teenage boy  says
they allow people to contact others who are far away
it is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing
the heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water
you can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive
in the essay it says the sun was beginning to heat beat down but i barely noticed it
and it more people are outside will notice how nature is and says that use of the electricity in a house
using a computer all day will not let you meet new people and see new places
that would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries
and it helps you with your school work home work research of a country place house vacation you can do lots of things
in my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it
the second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus and the geese and the change of seasons
music has become a way for people to express them selves
another reason computers are bad is because of health issues
censorship in media has been around since the beginning of 
however you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact
also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it
and it is wrong and inhuman
a street hawker carries his things on his head
people need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them
we can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways
however two in three wont do so
who wants to do that
when the geese come back in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding i will take that test again
dear local you know long of time spent on technology could result in cancer
many people depend on computers
it will start to get 
many business rely on the work of computers entirely
he was very polite
a cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere
most importantly computers have created a way for you talk to friends and family around the globe
i say get read of it all and do everyone a favor
computers have a positive effect in so many ways for example school work talk to other and just get information
in conclusion computers do not help us
how is that fare to others who might like it
this shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person
a lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer playing games and going on their favorite websites
well libraries contain more then just books
the is all computerized today and that is a major trade way today
televisions have almost replaced the radios and transistors
i remember when i was in middle school i really wanted to read novels that i saw at the library
when the malignant being is the government itself
then take a nice walk or stroll in the park
in his community that was filled with hardworking immigrants came together in great solidarity  friendship
censorship such as in the book is being used
also how there was always music that was like an endless celebration
two spend less time exercising
so in the end they have mad a home and a relationship together and with other people
finally a building came into view
you never know who might need the information
everyone is different
so many essential resources are on computers
some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages
if one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves
my father and his father has all of their records in a safe
however he shows great determination and control
the cyclist took his advice he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast
there was also a lot of life at his house
people would be even more offended than before in that case
the library should have more that one copy of a book
if it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard
it really does work on your hand and eye coordination
your sight is very important to living
the setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict
this is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class
lastly the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world
i think the mood of this story is warm and loving
or people you can see computers let you find the information you the time has that computers without or keeping people away from family
that shows the caring thoughtful tone the author had as he remembered fondly about his past
i want people to get along with each other
however people still think computers are good
for example if you are listening to a sad song you feel sad or depressed
if we went to travel by train we have to buy tickets
also it gives a great learning ability to people particularly student
back to the point
take interest in their life and shower love unconditionally on them
only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human
the show many dieting plans such as or 
that is how the mood is set
com or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves
some would say yes to this and others would say no
however that is the way people in that time spoke
in the evening we play cricket at the school playground
this can educate others in to knowing that if you do this then this is the result good or bad
i have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy and i have also seen parents go the other way
most works even the more crude pieces have some sort of educational value
also kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it
 computers were invented they have grown so much which make a lot people use them more
yet we still want to read listen watch and look at them
between checking email accounts and updating the average person spends of their day on the computer
the mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic warm and thankful
we are also taking away books that interest a child
so i am here with my parents because of a computer
computers change all that
i was little i rarely ever went on the computer
libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library
from scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires
lincoln was a great man who loved mankind
if you are staring at the computer all day your eyes not be used to seeing everything else
dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle
if you missed the best part of a you could easily go on a computer look it up and importance of computers in every day society
i also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir
everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch
other than the affects social sites and exercise has had because of computers online gaming is also a big issue too
being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer
also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it offend them
if you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer
and physically she will age which will also teach her new things
one reason i support computers is because they help with writing
computers are a huge impact on society but do they make everything better
there is a lot more to life than being on the web
i disagree with library censorship
his water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason
first kids might have problems online and to keep the problem to get worst
the staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do
ladies in european countries use ostrich feathers for their hats
first and foremost about of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers
you be doing work or chatting with a friend but your also just sitting their
all throughout the world there are libraries
in truth the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that
this is a threat to any living creature
for example the story was set on a highway set at which the cyclist was only able to do 
there is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures and those that educate them about sex and explicit material
my second reason is that the more people be on computers the more blind they could get just for being on the computers for a hour or more
i i do
lastly will stop you from spending time with friends and family
that leads us to the next big topic health
do you have good hand eye coordination
first of all computers have a positive effect on people
also technology is rapidly advancing and sometime in the future i think libraries will become extinct
the sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination
no one should be denied the chance to learn
computers not only help that but they are plentiful  can be used in places such as libraries on internet cafe
you can find information fast
there are so many great things they can be used for
people are sitting on the computer everyday eating and not moving at all and gaining weight
she failed the grade
distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch
the example that i can think of is a movie that is rated
again i thank you for reading this letter
computers can show you pictures of a place but when you are actually there it is really fascinating
removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech
he took it out on the water in  at our home and the engine and motor were broken
the horse came and ran in a circle
people can send horrible messages to someone
books are usually good things although they can be very bad
i know from own experience watching dad has came into room and told me to turn it off
the lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible
for example i mostly have how time to go on the computer

computers are helpful machines more the mist are missing out on using a computer
the open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist
children can find out the password and net around 
you can in less than one minute go on the internet type in to whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly

they offer so things such as information communication and life skills
or be active learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you
this book reveals much about human truth yet it was banned
in the paragraph it mentions all the sacrifice that his parents took to get their family to 
some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise you can talk to strangers and no interaction with family and friends
those who borrow anything at the library have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge
he describes the snow melting and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve
just because one might not believe in what a story says it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden
we should think carefully before we do something
researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer
then there is the man much torture
imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off
since libraries have many different kinds of magazines books and movies it is not always a safe place to just let your child roam around
the books movies and other materials should be marked saying that they be found offensive
educational tours arranged by schools promote interstate and international goodwill
more and more people should lay off it
if we allow people to censor what we read then how can we say that their is a book for everyone to like
my views can vary when i am older and have children of my own someday
we entered the airplane
picture yourself sitting at your desk talking to some friends online
the author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic
censorship is used most commonly with our movies video games and television
this is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general
by online in chat rooms bank etc
fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire
there was nobody around her to help
moreover computers are doors into the real world especially for residents of 
most people check out books or movies that they have heard about so for the most part they know what they are reading be offensive
it would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book
there is the oldies country jazz hip hop an etc
i hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else
these songs show us why children are having children or doing drugs
in the past books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful
and last get off the computer and go see your family and friends
i believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family
enjoying the topic or material is optional
she knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home
there are many people that now have the ability to get a online education because of problem that they have
hear what he was doing and even see the view of from his window
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and up lifting
however the effects it has on people can be bad
i do have to agree with because she is right
in conclusion one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion
gandhi did not like it
she needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country
the children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular
because the materials some times harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital
and she is absolutely right
did you know that you can even video chat with people
she thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was and a model
a solution a new wonderful machine called
not only are computers used to educate but they are helpful in the real world
if the worry is concerning youth parental guidance should be in affect
now imagine what that does to your body
they left behind everything and everyone they loved basically a huge chunk of them and for that he is extremely grateful
it helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano
takes him over terrain not suitable for biking
we all have a right to read watch and listen to anything we please
the second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life
his mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared
could it be language graphic scenes or parts that are just extremely scary
in  typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require
no child needs to be put under a bad influence
when i was in seventh grade i had a mission to read every book i could get my hands on
sometime the teen is persuade to leave their home and neighbor hood to meet the other user
i can see the headlines now  watching movie cause them to be murders
all of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though
how would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas
the last example was that he grateful for his parents sacrifice and love
censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such
some movies are better if they have bad things in them makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes
to me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends
these two subjects bring me to my last reason if people cant find what they want
at the same time we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some
in this essay i will explain why it is bad to spent too much time on computers
lastly you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research
but some do not think that the libraries should be putting stuff there if they are not going to let any one touch it or check it out
authors write or type every word for a reason whether happy or sad or vulgar
we learned a lot from this fair
the first girl said 
one reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels
my third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school
that the radio play
it was early in the morning when we started for the forest
i look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things
shouts your computer
they are big helpers
dear people computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them
please read on so i can explain my reasons
rap country or rock music
the computer can make things visual to kids and out
twice i found myself in very uncomfortable position
for instance he makes it to this town a guy swore was there but it turned out to be abandoned
you can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes
i believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library
this affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat
then it can give a better communication to others that lives farther away from you
the first mood created by the author in the memoir was powerful
and you end up being successful
you can email or chat to your friends online and see what pages to read and get there phone numbers back
just to add to the misfortune of the story
whole generations of books music etc
these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive
this here shows how friendly both the families are together and they are happy to enjoy these meals
attached as people are to computers they cannot experience the world to the fullest
people can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time
there are many things that can happen in magazines like porn
during the day he works very hard
statistics show that of the kids that stay on the computer for a long time end up either failing a class or staying rack
media that be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people and to some it is considered disturbing
it just means they have different beliefs
that is not natural
they are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer
i could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you
this what i get out as the last paragraph are the story winter hibiscus as what it means to me
if they can be at home on the computer for hours then they probably can hang out in real life
the on books in the world today everything is showed every place you look
in the long run doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees
hours sitting at the computer replaces healthy exercise are all spending our lives on the computer and sitting and clicking is not exercise
he loves cooking and his parents taught him how to cook
we can also search any topic from a computer anywhere
first was they can teach kids bad thing
how would you work
others might argue that they have the right to read listen and watch what they would like
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
once we were finished with our assignments we could play type to learn 
i am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful
he is very punctual
she gave me a for a project grade
some materials are and should continue to be censored but to an extent
considering the freedom of speech one can express
statistics show that of people that listened to the radio were in cars
not only did see the positive effects of staying in contact
that shows she calm down already she feels better with her new country
if you said no i can tell you how
also people can get arrested for what they write online
if you need to do projects and research what better way to do them than on a computer
everything around her is different and new

now people can think that computers are good for you too
in addition to students doctors also greatly benefit from computers
and i will know about computers and man what to do
you will be always happy and feel very lucky that you have all of these things
thank you for reading my essay on why computers are benefiting our society
parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast and yet they allow sexual crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries
i told them i have as much rights too have those books on the shelve as they have to have their books on the shelves
when he came to a snake in the rode he had to get by his dehydrated state
in the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water
plus all she had was a map her bike and an empty water bottle
my second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live faraway
what are parents going to do when their go to school and hear other talk about subjects such as sex
this is a good way to conclude a story
that would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library
chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency
it is by the side of the
this affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very soft and compassionate
my first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer
computers are just another unnecessary thing in life
that is to say there should exist respect for the individual as the supreme motive of power
without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten
some people not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence but others will find it very offensive
computers help people with anything they need
last of all i think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills
this could cause even more conflicts between religious parties and in turn anything religious would be banned all together
look at what our world has become
dear  people at my school sit on there computers after school
computers are taking over our life
lastly if you have close relatives or friends that live far away there are many options today like   
our parents work hard to give us the best
if we just get off our computers and get out we can turn that around
there are a variety of computer games
with out family life would be much harder to deal with
you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book but those people will just have to deal with it
that is why i think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands
still censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries
a soldier is well trained in the use of weapons
all students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends
this is also the cause of a lot of obesity
some people have different opinions of the book or it means something different to them
some are just the artist sing and dancing in a background other times people make fun of other artists
if a knife was you human nature world tell you to cover your head with your hands
they have to tie white ribbon also
every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades
so when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books
this also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person
plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids
our family will video chat with him over a program called 
a great example of a media material that is challenged every day in every part of the world is a book called the bible
getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment
computers are a great way to get in touch with people
the author states that he is very grateful for his parents and that there is no way to express the love he feels for his parents
do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer
books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning
we are all the same deep down inside
in the story winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons
on a computer it will say if they have any or not you would need to tickets would have the exact same thing
i know i 
the heat could have killed him anytime
upon finding a book that is offensive the reader then can make that decision and not read the book
this is true that you could use the phone and call them out you have to pay for long distance
adults along with young adults have to know what they should read and whats not acceptable
he said i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean as he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight
whether or not something is offensive the information should be out there for one to learn about if he chooses
well we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future 
when he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst
they leave a positive effect on people in the community and world
there are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against
i believe is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to
our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete utter disaster
he is very helpful to all
or a person listening to hard and violent music feel upset or angry
some people say begging is an essay way to live
all the old people i know hate all the rap
this is not the case
there are some books though that i agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive
remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me but i know i was so upset by how the book was
once a road needs to be repaired work is done that pollutes into the environment even more
books hold a great charm for me
certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated for instance should be placed elsewhere on the shelves immediately
material with too much threat in it make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen
she knows that she will pass the test
dear  i am a student from  i do think that certain materials such as books
it is a carnivorous animal and its long mane gives it a handsome and proud look
and it worked i got a much better grade then i did on the one i guessed on
certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated or 
 in my opinion computers can be entertaining and educational but should not replace everyday living
the first reason i think that computers have a positive affect on society is because its gives you lots of information
computers have completely changed the world
you just sit on a hard chair looking at an electronics device that is going to take you no where in life
dear   some people do spend most of the day on the computers but not everyone
also he ran out of water and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around
the last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it
dear local newspaper i think that computers have a good effect on people
a favorite book of many kids is the series
libraries have been around for ages most of them started out small and now are big
computers are getting in the way of everything
it is a nasty part of reality
here lies the problem
they left the place they were most in for him
so i hope you take this in consideration that computer are great society
if we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books
you also have to watch this movie with an adult
if you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more
they need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book
he is always ready to serve and help his neighbors
most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in there sport
the decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media
lastly computers allow us to internet with friends from our chairs
for me to have fun on
but there are so many benefits of a computer
then parents will have so hard time calling their kids to go eat or to go to sleep
so i went online on and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in minutes
to whom it concern i was sitting at home when i have realized this has to come to an end
thus trees replace oxygen which is constantly used up and changed into carbon dioxide in breathing and burning
dear editor do you do all day
not everyone will see the meaning but it is there
first and foremost the use of computers will tribute to better research
children learn by hands on or watching other things
well its true
the mood created by the author in this memoir is happy and grateful
most of the crime we have today people blame on music
no one is the same we all have different likes and interest
so tell me what you think
but distracting games that waste time also cause stress which could be fatal
people professors historians and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday
computers are vital to us because they help our reflexes
after the sun sets he returns home
what are the children of the world being taught
in do not exceed posted speed limit a cyclist follows some bad advice which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water
public items such as televisions radios magazines and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world
once the software has been installed it will usually lead you step by step through the process of paying your bills
if there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent or read 
the libraries are organized into section by categories of books
the author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted show how the flower gave the little girl strength
it shows everything it tells you stories
movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials
i wished i could join them
your almost taking the words out of context when you do this
he does this through his word choice
all of these are factors found in our books and music we have today
dear editor computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race
i mean every time you hit that on switch you and the computer become attached
so why use them
from personal experience being addicted to computers i can honestly say that i was under almost complete control by that computer
in fact muscles start it is recommended to get in at least one hour of exercise of outside play a days
multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things
the author found a bait shop and got water
it inundates large area under cultivation wrecks public services and makes life miserable
by cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds
the story says plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world ho
they do not get enough exercise and frankly abusing computers is not good for your life physically or socially
people like accountants use computer for there job
of kids like to read
so having music at libraries is just giving them a free way to get it
dear newspaper the world that we live in today is full of technology
it is true that many of these movies or the lyrics in the songs could strike someone as offensive
obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern
that about sums that up
so i am going to talk about what i have heard about my family seeing or finding books music movies and magazines offensive
it gives you the to try something you enjoy what you get
well i hope you enjoy my essay about the computer world
the mood created by the is friendship and love
once again it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time
the poor people have more children
the music i am with it being taken out of the libraries
everyone has different views on that book or movie
a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
everybody has a different taste in media
i think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections  and my views on the censorship of 
also kids get into dangerous for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to
in the story winter hibiscus the author concludes his story with an odd ending
if a person want to read something they should be allowed
last and final reason is its fun and easy to use
the cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him
someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program
the video has been viewed over million times
sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation
the reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also
they should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better
your spending too much time on the computer your mom and dad well out
everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills
any way a computer is used has the potential to have a positive effect on someone
sometimes what is considered offensive to one person is essential to another
lastly you can get addicted to the computer
lastly allows socializing
so should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves or should we keep them anyways
had his dad come get him from the party
although there are other things that can be found in the library as well
in the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill
it will create a more civil trip to the library
she knew what it was like when she was young
computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures
on computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away
they can find out what the weather is like so they know how to puck when going places
they communicate there more than they could without computers
he uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips
weather places the will to continue all are reason that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist
of course you come across a book that be offensive to someone maybe even yourself but it is there for a reason
looking back on it i am surprised i was allowed to check them out at the library
everyone is entitled to their own opinion
those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision
the committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also
the same goes for an offensive  magazine or movie
we should look before we leap
computers have helped children and adults learn increased the amount of jobs and computers have helped law enforcement as well
this shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer you realize that typing becomes easier
although there are some upsides to computers like doing research and interacting with people there are more bad aspects then good ones when it comes to computers
smoking can lead to cancer or death
in this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so
many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us
  in that he also says how he got his culinary skills from his parents and that he was grateful for it
as you can see the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room
yet that is just me
some people type as fast as cheetah runs
also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings
you can use computers to research different things
when he pumped the water no come out
for example when the terrain turned to hills the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy
this mood is because the author is talking about the parents hardships
dear local newspaper a society we have come very for regarding advancements and inventions
she is going to overcome the problem
people visit the library to find materials that they are interested in or look around to expand their interests
so the internet can also be a way of saving money
means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song
books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination
a child on the computer is wasting time not being active
books music movies they are all art
nowadays the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site
the camel he was in was affecting his brain and he just wanted to get it over with
the games are horrible for the computer
interacting is a nice enjoy nature and have fun
this might be fine at first but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want
at every click of your mouse there are new things to learn
video games are also popular
this is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note
not only do the schools help students but also everyday people help as well
i dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work
fortunately the bus started again
she finds new hope after buying the plant and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about
this is what happiness really is
if these authors directors and producers have their specific product taken off of the shelves it would be offensive to them
i think these websites are great and can only improve society
hobbies keep us busy and happy
the final problem he faces is the 
have any of you ever been bored
and those are some of my reason why the author added mood to this memoir
everything he had trouble with he found directly on the computer
so computers have a positive effect on people
the only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling
did you know you should have a minimum of min in sunlight each day
first allows students to easily get good grades on projects and reports
for example they go on website  they go on it over  over  over again
the mood in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful
i think that the bad books and all the adult books magazines and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries
to some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life
however teachers say that ever since was invented the students grades were skyrocketing
or you never know you could forever and never be found
it revolves us as a whole and if someones starts taking off books who is to stop someone else from doing the same
computers can be relied on by people
we need computers to do this
say you wanted to go on vacation with your family
but you can educate someone about the subject matter
when she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test
books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity
of course you are going to be tired if you sit for a couple hours staring at a computer screen
despite the racism going on in the places around them his parents were able to bring people together by being welcoming helpful and friendly
i feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives
if you agree you can do something about it
dear newspaper  opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people
imagine how tough it would be without a computer to rely on when you have no idea how to answer something
well i can tell you why
this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves
computers can help everyone connect with anyone you can see computers have so many positive effects on people
another reason i do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is not everyone is offended by the same thing
secondly i disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section
last but not least computers have allowed us to access information like never before
the author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this
then the student will be able to successfully complete the project
also you can see what people your age do for a living
the computer is a greet way to meet new people that share the same characteristics as you
but your savior has arrived
we as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions censorship destroys our ability to do so
there are many times in the memoir when author created a mood
there are so many
i solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family
for example she likes bitter melon it says
she says its alright and you guys keep chatting it all worked out
he has a small garden where he grows some fruits
music like movies is also rated by the content of the song
they can start believing that they are nothing
everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates
people especially children forget the risks of physical health
a lot of our population of the are obese including kids
another thing you can be taught or informed about is news
when you think about it our country would be no where without these spectacular devices
if libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them
they build fantastic hand eye coordination and help with many things including  sports
when you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam
the setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot him not having anything to drink nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages
we use milk in our everyday cooking
his memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them
some teens would be horrified of looking through these books and others would be fascinated by it
in the story rough road ahead the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways
i know i would not
you could pick a book up learn about it and how to deal with it
if the boat is rowed by more than one boatman they should have a perfect and clear understanding
computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places
you have the choice not to read them or to read them
i liked to explore the library and find new things
having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself
people bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it
i am sure this boy doesn’t like to get hit by things thrown
another example my sister gets home first thing
computers have helped the modern world with questions long distance friends and entertainment
the second girl asked confused 
for example people who sit there all day on the computers spend less of their time exercising enjoying nature socializing with friends and families
these technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people
in addition censoring is the correct thing to do
how can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things
it was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house
another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do
most people get addicted for the certain things they do online
new some people think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games
i suppose you can infer how this turns out one game turns two and so on
so instead of having a chat over the computer screen plan a meeting in person
computers hold a lot of information many people learn things they have never heard of on the internet
the same moods came everyone that was mentioned in the memoir
there are bad books but there are also good books in the library
you also have to think how would that affect the business of stores libraries and other businesses
we need books for many things from learning to simply use up time
this is a huge problem
should have some type of censorship
allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that maybe not have the info
products in a library are for anyone to view not to judge
that is why i think the people is wrong saying the or is not
they can also make it easier to buy things you need look for jobs and many other things
and to me that is not fair
over the past years i have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart
first thing we should discover is how many people like books movies or music like that
the last reason why i think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use it for entertainment
however i believe that is not true
dear local newspaper more and more people are getting hooked on computers
all he did for almost a week was socialize and beat his personal best score on a game
first the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like
these features affected the cyclist a great deal
if a child gets addicted to the computer it will affect how he interacts with other and do serious damage to their brain
this shows how he is doubtful
other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families
technology was made to make things easier do we should take advantage of it
the temptations to read violent and vulgar books should be overcome
my friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too
in my opinion i believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries
some of the great classic novels have contents that could be considered offensive to many people
every year he send a general report of its functioning expansion programme and financial commitments etc
if the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed
learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn
people should maintain a right to choose which books he or she want to read
if a you look back to the times before computers you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child
secondly it gives you new ideas on things
did you know of all use computers regularly
we cam improve just by computer
people get addicted to them everyday
he feels a loving mood because his family love and take care of him
not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see
each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest
this is why computers are valuable to everyday life
if i had to choose between doing homework or chatting on  i would choose 
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
from young students to adults computers have become a favorite machine modern day technology
you can share you want with people you barely see
computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family
they help bring people together provide entertainment and have very useful information
also talking to friends online is fun too
just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it
many of them not be appropriate but whenever you walk into the library its almost as if they are promoting drugs alcohol and sex
also again you hear it on a daily basic like swearing
she has four kittens
this is why to continue forward with computers and technology for the future
helps students do there school work
many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer
the internet was an amazing idea
everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person
he also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back
at the library i go to they have any kind of book music movie and magazine you want
the reason being on why i stopped being his friend was he to get mad if i come over there to ask if he can come outside
thank you for listening to me
this is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor
it has seat and a handle
it is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college
parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want but some parents choose to wait
inside a library there are different sections
he said they showed him their lives and those teachings have been the basis of his life
for one why should the books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series
if you use the computer its bad but if you use it in moderation then its a little better
at   of the students learned about new cultures in one year thanks to computers
i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
if a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home
many books magazines and television shows portray this as well
a lot of might get offended by all the racial slurs about 
businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as 
songs made today can get a little out of hand
i own a very good map and id always stick to it in the future
just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild
foe example lets say that you doing on paper you 
the parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking
these books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people
with all of these reasons i hope you see why computers are beneficial to society
but as second road sign appeared he was relieved
readers the computer can help you in your school work
some newspapers are organs of political party
the author said that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
this can be a big problem
its not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from
then everything can stay on the shelves
they are also a great way to learn
there are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books
computers are also not always dependable or safe
this will always happen and theirs nothing we can do about it
nothing that is what we could 
the setting is in a dessert which is very hot there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert
readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist
finally he came to another town got some water and then left after going through ghost towns
last reason is that it tells us that she is and will be doing her best
however people say that computers give the wrong information many times but you find a wonderful website it will never lie to you
in my opinion people can also learn from computers
the library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book movie or magazine of their desire
that she would be better off without him there
sometimes you can even play with you friends online with a online game
he always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination
people have the right to say or write whatever they believe
people depend on them a lot but same people disagree
people do not like policemen because they think that all policemen are corrupt and dishonest
dear  i would like to notify your business that computers benefit society
books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read
the last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the reader knows exactly what is going to happen in the future
this tired him out faster since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain
the second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions
when we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more
censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for
his mood at this point was already confident but this adds to it with words like rushing being encouraging to him
thanks for my reason about computer building skill having info and fun
in the story winter hibiscus by ho
such as the rated movies or books that are inappropriate for young children
for example you can jump rope go to the park go swimming play in the snow and many more
people might get offended and stop going to the library
the internet provides an efficient low casting or even free way to help any language learner
so my suggestion is to not move them and let them stay on shelves just as any other book would
final reason is computers allow you to talk online with your friends
i think you would agree that without computers we would a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us
she hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test
so parents be the boss about that stuff
every since people are young they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style
 who had just moved to my school looked bold and confident
they make it seem cool
the features of setting affect the cyclist
lastly with computers you can talk to people around the world
the author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and shell be stranger than she was before
some movies could do without so much violence but they have to make money some how
everyone has there own opinion about things so why should that effect what we are allowed to learn
most kids should go out side more for example my friend spent hours a day
i believe we should not have that right to pull thing off of shelves freely
parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds
more people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest
they are being rated  suitable for all ages  suitable for children and older and rated  suitable for people and older
people think differently from each other
some parents bring their child up they way they want to
the internet is not the only distraction on a 
why would you take things away that people actually enjoy
another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type
computers teach us and sometimes can guide you
she became and cleaner
this caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die
this would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot
the reason we now have shows on about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people
if we do something without thinking about its outcomes it can harm us
there are too many magazines that try and expose women
he should attend school regularly
then the bell rang
please consider my opinions the right way
now do i think the the novel should be banned from a library
so as you can see i highly disagree with the overuse of computers
computers allow use to play games and learn about almost anything
another thing computers are great for is talking
some people say that you can learn about animals and plants on a computer but there is nothing like really being outside with them
how do i stay in contact with them you use
taking books off the shelve taking knowledge away from the people
explaining how his family loves cooking and playing music
going to college online is so easy
all are very fun things to that you could be missing out on learning of the computer
because of it he misses at least day of school a week
do you think computers have a negative effect on people
also the tone of which said said this showed hope she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass
try and change what the reader might think about that time
he had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life
many features of the setting affected him
they improve our minds and awaken our souls
we want to see whether the person knockin is the postman
how could you resist those temptations
whenever i have a holiday i pick up any book from the shelf and read it
we should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt
i mean that he always had something to do
using the computer is not a good price to pay for you health
the last bell rang
dear newspaper you really think computers are that good
scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school
the author also says how he admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly
you want get excise
this sight was troubling 
then imagine that they snatch that book up and you never see it again
everyone has a right to their own opinion
he was a very learned man but he was very humble
for example when my dad got home
the book was about a guy who was out drinking the guy had know other way home than to drive
so who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive of not
libraries should remain entirely intact forever
dear  should certain books be removed because some people think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read
for instance one of my friends handed in an essay and our teacher did not accept it
everyone is offended by something
one way is that the rolling hills let the rider get more tired
so over all i say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands
bad characters create a lot of trouble for all of us
the author concludes the story with the last paragraph
kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library
there is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country
and when they got here they had to start fresh and take any jobs they could find
also you have relatives who live across the country you could use webcam to talk with them
to value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen
the final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay
as he forms out most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water
finally as the earthquake in i was able to donate through the website
the libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies
people have and always will want need and desire different things
i know you will agree with me when i say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves
having a   or account allows you to chat with people all over the world
computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs and other skills you need times in life
the author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test
i think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive
these things can still benefit our society though
all they had to do me
i say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing
they really make us more intelligent
and my conclusion with all three reasons
so that is my input on the situation
that is how the sets the tone for this story
computers is a good benefit for people
other games such as the  require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes
someone riots and they get to take off the shelf
so there is a lot of reasons why i think that people should remove certain book movies magazines or anything that involves offensive stuff
the last one is magazines
the winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged
i do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate
so keep the books around its only words
wait i know that book
so instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking on the daily news or searching like that
as i read this i could feel a warm welcoming from home
if you have a friend or relative that lives very far away you can easily go at talk and have a video conference
another girl came on a cycle with one wheel
it takes away freedom
then what can you do
it has a long neck and a tiny head
with computers also were more likely to be overweight and choose chips over an apple in a study performed at 
when she is on she ignores everything around her
but on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended
i believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the and other people around the world
the library is not just for the children but also for the adults
they he is to build skill of typing help and it easy and also help keep and family connected
there is no doubt that every child sitting here loves and respects their father and mother
learning from books music movies and magazines is good in a way
we choose that life style for our children so we cant really blame the music and the movies
they handed him to the police
the hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty
from books to music lyrics our culture embraces us with it
some libraries not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others
computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places people etc
whether they are fiction or nonfiction
they put things out there like that because they could encourage someone else
her hibiscus would keep her culture tradition and memories alive as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in 
that just how people are and were
in fact about of computer say that over a using a computer
some people not find this offensive
i also wanted to take you to the other side without computers
i believe that older teens like and are more mature about this if they read a book in the library that might have a bad word
for years now people have wanted books that are read in school to be censored for bad language
at the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles
and with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it they would be greatly offended and very upset
i believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in the world today
hey a small window pops up you screen
children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home television and even at school than in some books
if you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out you will then know what i am saying
for example the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated
like me  a chance to say whats on their mind
some for good others for bad
in the essay the features of the setting affect the cyclist
this very useful technology has a positive effect on people because it allows people to send receive and research a vast variety of information easily
the story was ended like this to show that the girl will have a new beginning
but it good for there health
school websites also give people benefits in our society
so censorship to me is not going to make any difference
would they put more candy to make the world fat
there fore computers hurt and are not as good as real people
whether the lack of water the hills the tumble weeds all are things that affect the cyclist
these things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer
computers as you know are one of the worlds greatest information posts
me and him meet only once a year
for example the internet and websites like   etc
he feels more confident and can ride to his destination
when she want to the greenhouse all of the
if you have a favorite sports team band or are interested in a famous figure you have tons of information on them at your disposal
lastly the known word
that story reflects that helping someone is a key to life
even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world
the cyclist comes to the first town but only finds yet again no water and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty
strategy come in handy surely you now see that some games are very educational
all things in the world are not strictly black and white
with computer you can look up available homes and apartments
books are written by very wise experienced and intelligent persons
if book were to be removed from libraries people would miss a story that they might connect with
how will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen
but then i see a person really enjoying their time at the library
these are the main reasons why computers are not beneficial to the society
overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph
the main reason is there is always going to be conflict between or more groups of people
when he talks about his heritage he speaks about his food home and music that gives the reader a sense of pride
it would tire him
if people want to get it they can but it would be at there own risk
schools try to provide books that appeal to all audiences but that ability is being impaired by books being banned from shelves
mother is important member of the house
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
stories about knights and princesses are great for young people but other stories about the darker sides of life are normally kept away from the hands of children
the banning of books is a banning of freedom
some enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while my prefer the thrill of a horror story
books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them
along with many other search engines are an easy way to find what you are looking for
or listen to music there are websites for them also
eat good plain natural food and drink a lot of clean water
books are a great part of history
this is because the information all to unknown people
school is not only a teaching building but also a social place
everyone has some friends
people should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect
do i think that books movies music or magazines should be removed from the library
there was one time when i went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research
i have a beautiful red toy car
they do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big happy family
she decided to retake the test
this means that they are great cooks and have skills for cooking
secondly there are many coll websites you can join
the cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of
that way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone
so how can we help to solve this problem
that is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear
since i have two computers and one laptop i have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer
people want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin
so he starts riding again
but creators of the computer are worried that people are spending to much time on the computer
this advancement in technology has made the century the most modern era this world has ever seen and is beneficial to society
the town took them away
many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language
some people agrees that it benefit the society and others disagree
it is now or never the decision is in your hand make the right decision and say no to computers
could use it for related 
he starts out good then comes to a rough road and he even says sometimes life can feel so cruel
i had gotten a on this project
people overusing their computer is also a big problem
this young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes
he is found everywhere in his uniform
computers let us look up valuable info
is grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else
the setting plays a large role in the story
that is not what the world should become but that is what is society is creating
the games teach you different things about history
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit the setting often affects the character
well are lives without computers can be bad
books of all sorts should be allowed to children and adults of all ages
the sun was not starting to get him 
all you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too
if people began to take away options on reading materials some kids refuse to read at all
the first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute
the computer also effects you heath because your in a room inside not getting any air
the computer gives you answer to question you have
the computer helps us learn of faraway places it lets us communicate with friends and family all over the globe and lastly the computer entertain us
though peoples opinions differ each opinion is equally important to that certain person
censorship in libraries today i believe are not a big problem
many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs
not just one genre a person wants
movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way
all of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online if it were still allowed
families who stay of the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades
will see the magazine as an opportunity
they also have lots of websites for help with a new language
during school i type up my essay
the setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways
i find a lot of people to say things that offend me but that does not mean that i have the right to make them stop talking
another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them
the mood created by the author in this memoir is lovable
there is always someone that has a different opinion of things
family and friends and even mental health
never find fault or speak ill of them
plus you can plan vacation to a place and be sure you will have enough money by checking the price online
in my opinion there should be very censorship in a library
the part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time
i think that people are spending a lot of time on there computers and not enjoying nature and things
now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today
this would make her feel strong and focused
he really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill
from the reasons above i state that computers are useful because they give people the ability to learn about anything they want
computers have brought us a long way
dear  your at home and you are on the computer
i was so sad
you can find all good stuff online
 about what your to do
there are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society
parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such seeing something that a toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see
like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug
so if you are ever wondering weather or not to buy a computer i suggest you get one
next this is good for buyers and sellers
i have learned to deal with all of those things from books
secondly the computers has all the latest news happening all over the world
i believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some
lastly computers have had negative effect on society because of money
supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect
the heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists
i also use it to write conclusions for science labs
computers are one of the best things that has ever been made
we have made pornography an easily obtainable thing and music that promotes sex drugs violence and alcohol
therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries
initially imagine you have a project due in two days
i literally knew nothing about them and i failed to bring home my book
certain people like certain types of books maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in
at least you getting up to get the phone
additionally he biked across a water pump that was well needed he tried to pump water but got no success
the terrain affects the cyclist because of the hills
he also provides us with sugarcane cabbage cauliflower beans and many other vegetables and grains
as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams
there are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist
that could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test
she wants to be able to handle the loss better
in conclusion just go outside and have fun
lastly some adults would be upset of the removal of some books
the cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living  when he comes upon a fish camp
no need to look and look a hundreds of books just to get one little fact
that gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world
of sleep ever which lets us make it through school
they will not have their own views and will be largely ignorant to the world around them
the material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life and people find that wrong then it means they do not experience life
i assure them that i understand those feelings
the computer could also be useful for planning a vacation
that is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age
many abandoned factories the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones
but there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted
after everything it does not matter what is offensive to people  they will just have to deal with it
the way i see it is family and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important
in the quote the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing
everything is in 
we need to learn about those kind of thing
i asked  happened
i want to talk about interacting with family and friends
with the computer came smaller more compact computers till they were able to fit in the palm of our hand
some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it
the writers of this were aware that freedom of creativity should not be held back from the people
without these books these can become something in the past and nothing more
all they would have to do is go to the internet type what they were for and it would come up on the screen
now you know that computers make life efficient
what some people think is the most innocent book could offend another individual
a slanging match started
floods however have always brought out the best in men
if you do you will learn so many things
which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea
our founding fathers creating amendments for the people
we also learn about their traditions and culture
the desert effects the cyclist real bad
now that is unfair
what if you were looking for a new home
the thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful
we see bad behavior every day like stealing cussing murder and assault
well to me it does benefit society in many ways like learning online
there are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends
in factual righting it is something that remains in peoples heads and is saved into the brain like a word document
one offensive to a person not be offensive to another
people say that computers are teaching important skills
it would make everything far less dramatic
how of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam
never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into
computers give you too much information than a book
all books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores regardless of the methods used in them
the test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied
should one take offense to a certain book they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it
therefore they use the language and words of the time period they write about
computers more and more people are using them
ms says the computer game has helped her
the mood created by the author in my opinion is a happy mood
we should not result to censoring books movies and music in libraries and other places just to try make people happy
many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come
have you used your today
for example one person like to read philosophical books and the other like to read romance comedy books
the setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men
i know you agree with me
when he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story
therefore computers have no negative effect on people and they remain an essential asset in everyday life
everyone has there own freedom
books are big powerful and a vast amount of information
they are always cheerful and warm
parents send messages via email to their children at college
sent over the  faster than any service
computers are a very helpful tool that benefit everyone in society
it is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone
for break me and my dad used the internet to learn about we then decided to go there and bought tickets
in my personal opinion i believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose
they are causing a variety of problems in peoples health mind etc
the computer has games internet and ways to talk to people that get then attached
other people work online
the might not even go near you if you forget about them
is the only good and the only light comes from 
dear  i have been informed that recently people are questioning the use of computers
people inhabit them grow date palms fruit and vegetable there
if that person is pleased then the first person is offended
for starter the contents on computers and the internet are too much for people and society
the reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come
the speed limit was and he was going so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps
right now they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games and movies
there are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning
i rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face
he was riding along on a route he had little confidence would end up anywhere
our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years
it make the person feel emotions that bring them down
i could not do my events for science so i got a on it
oh let me start with no
reading is the best way to learn
the reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising
not only are you getting good benefits on the outdoors but so is your partner
computers teach hand eye coordination give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to socialize online
in the memoir the mood that the author created is the memoir can be in two ways
parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others
my conclusion is that with computer you could have a better life
in the memoir the mood created by the author is very understandable and true
this is not good because when you go outside it helps skin health from the sunlight  lets in fresh air for your lungs
people have not realized the need to exercise more often
i mean if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in
on monday i had two papersenglish and mathematics
my last reason is communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation
they communicate with each other with using sounds like clicks and whistles
after some time a team of traffic police came
 i think we have a problem
this is my last reason
they should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point
the sooner could be better or for the worst
yes its true computers helps you learn things you not have known before but so do books newspapers and magazines
this final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing
thank you for reading my paper
the author of this story created quite a mood in these few paragraphs
some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family
in conclusion libraries have been around for ever
friends and family are special gifts
the hibiscus symbolized her determination in life
dear readers of the local newspaper more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
this shows that he was energized and happy
when my friends and i were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable and accurate
dear  do people benefit from the use of computers
thank you for your time
instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and  you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early
she greatly emphasized warmth and safety
but how will we be able to do that if we only email and 
anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free rather than paying for it themselves
these are many great things you can do outside
it is also a great learning technique for research
computers help us with our education
if a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting should we take all movies books and magazines out of our libraries
children do need to be experiencing learning about or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries
certain things that offend people can be enjoyed by other people
the rode was all messed up
the author concludes this way because it refers that its not over and even though the test was a failure it wont be next time
when you think of 
i think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children
they have no need for things that are offensive because rarely something that is offensive provides information
how many of you have ever heard any offensive language
people can make there own decision of what they want to listen watch or read
for now children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting
if their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book
you can easily fine information any subject you want or find the name of that song you just heard on the using your computer
i know this from experience
computers are also an ideal way to communicate with friends and family
its their business and they decide what materials stay and which ones go
i was wearing three pullovers but was still shivering with cold
it is the same with the health and functions at our bodies
dear local newspaper i believe that computers are effecting the lives of many people
in conclusion i do not think offensive materials should be remove
but first was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool
it can cause many problems with others
you can see here the positive effects of a computer
had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified
one of the reasons f think computers have a bad effect on people is addictions
all modern means of transport have made traveling very easy
i am years old and i go to a in called 
there are musics movies magazines and many more
computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date
instead of letting the facts be the facts people want to adjust things so it is less offensive
erasing things from liveshave done no good before
so why travel when you can see all of it on your computer
i think that this would be fair for everyone
this country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want
in conclusion people who spend too much time on their computer spend less of their time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with friends and families
one of the much enjoyed pieces of technology
now use computers to organize lesson plans and print out reminders for their students
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch
those were the moods the set into this memoir
children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do
then there are also people you had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person and vise versa
for thought maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections each with their own subject matter
many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as inappropriate language in songs books movies and magazines
she could look to the plant for inspiration
a large snake crossed my path
i do not think that is a good idea
it was at the when i was years old
for instance the cyclist says and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke
i think this for simple reasons  you gain computer skills which can help in other situations
some consider it a freedom of speech
some people were standing all around
in school now many projects are assigned meaning we need the computer and internet
he will never forget growing up and living in that house
in conclusion i believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay
it was there choice to pick it up and read it
instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as do research
my last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment
all these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved
internet websites can gives you pictures uploads almost every week
the cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through
today wherever you go there is technology being used
i do not question whether children and teens should read but rather what they read
all of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his 
in olden days paddy cultivation was done only in one season
just imagine more people outside and healthy
they think that computer can help them but yes to others it helps them to their work and education
on average computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand
while riding along these lands there was more in sight and no building or cars it was line a dead road
one that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes
this is why computers have a positive effect on people and everyone should have a computer
in the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him
in conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best
this quote explains welcoming people people creating the mood
censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long
among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book movies and magazines
this would not help
the author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored
they can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author written it this way
music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around
secondly can be made
computers can be time consuming
having a or allows you to do a video chat with someone
computers save time and make your life easier
for example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to
these of into an life because you do enjoying at all
they not get to check out items for free like at the library but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers
i understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries but their are some cons
its a new way to study and do other things to learn in a fun way
she is now out of the box and in a whole new world
and discovering the latest news
or they wont answer and they need information fast
the cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over
the feeling could be described as homey
i remember the time when i read an online novel and my whole body was ready to go and play
can you see now why i believe that having computers around is good
all in all that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages
there are more books in the library you can read
the authors express what they feel on a given topic
she had a rough day and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look as a goal
i hope you agree the computers do not always help society
i thought that the internet had just my mom better than i could that we should go on vacation
i would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs in which some could be offended
sports teach is to accept both defeat and victory in the same spirit
so eat carefully take exercise for health and cultivate mental energy for a better life
the features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot
in the grocery shops people can buy grains rice lentils and spices
an ideal teacher treats his students like his own children
this is way computers can change your life
dear newspaper computers are everywhere in our nation
of are already obese so why keep these horrid games out there
another big is those stupid online games
if you think about it each and every one of those billion minds thinks differently
my dad introduced me to classic rock and my mom loved soft rock
it can increase their education give them entertainment and even help out on their job or help them find a job
you can find information on anything in a library from any point of view
if based on a true story and offensive it should be heard anywise because part of history
instead of carrying a text book you can just use a megabyte book on the internet
i know that you can break free from it because i once experienced the same thing
in the  where its nice shaded and cool he feels fairly good
i hope you agree with me
yes they are
also this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration
my second example is the effect of the computer
i know from my own experiences that the internet helps
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
there are several problems and risks that come with a computer
it is also hard to get used to climate change and learning another language
on the internet the family could find the numbers the and some information about it
of the shelf of a library or anywhere else those items are displayed
when your a kid my age when you have a computer all you want to do is play games online with friends
suddenly we heard a cry of alarm
that is what i believe in
it also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake which added to his thirst
the last thing needs is more kids becoming fat
i can see these questions flying through heads of great people
however i believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways
it also a symbol of her constant blossoming
i would not remove 
the author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined
you can search places and people
the author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought  a process gone through where she was learning  growing
what experiences did you have
something that commonly said
he did not dwell on the negatives did not say what he would like to change
all the electronics these days are making people forget about nature and that needs to change
using computers is good for the body as well as the mind
this can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away
now we have   and others
there would be no quick access to information no way to socialize and no way to keep your health records or other personal information safe
all during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family
on the computer there is a lot of information about people places thing and anything you want to know
i believe that this new technology is effecting our daily exercising playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family
i can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where i can learn all about the places i want to visit
he can read and write hindi and english
you use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type
for example certain religious books might offend people of other religions but that does not mean that we should take them off the shelves
he talked about the cheerful house people and neighborhood
too many people spend countless hours on their computers rather than doing other activities
therefore this memoir has moods that are created by the author
this shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on
for the first couple of weeks i felt like an outcast like an outsider looking in
the possibilities computer allow you to do is research
he is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable
positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand
i love all of his books but these ones are the best
it is a season of birth and growing
everywhere so much of noise is there and the people have grown insensitive and are not affected by this
but think about a library and then imagine a computer
magazines and journals are kept on the tables
otherwise there is bound to be confusion
being in that situation and setting i would have given up
with that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding
i eagerly wait for it all through the year
if someone finds something particularly offensive i believe they just should not view it
just like rated movies or rated video games
you like music movies and more
how much easier could it get
in conclusion computers have negative effects on society because they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight
the mood the author created in the memoir loving and happiness
so that just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending
the freedom of speech and religion and even what type of movies you want to watch
he will abuse of you or kill you
when we are in trouble books stand by us and give us the right advice
suddenly we heard a cry for help
there are many people on the computer and if must be stopped
for example in his story the of 
or would you really want to do that to someone else
he has a small shop where he works from morning till night
should books magazines or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves
should books music etc be removed from shelves if they are found offensive
it saves time and is way neater
but eventually with right leadership it would help make a more truthful environment
it is just hoe our economy is these days
people need to communicate through computer a lot
dear newspaper do you feel about computers
authors have just as many rights as we do
you can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth
in case you are iffy about my reasons i will simply restate them
there are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse
the features affect the cyclist in a big way
i stayed with him for long
there is only the problems it is abandoned
the person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation
this quote is saying that he is dehydrated in is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain
not physical strength but mental strength
the books that interest me the most are fiction books
do you know online you can exercise your brain
i believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime
to start on with technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity
this is what i think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves
i think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it
the rest of the building is a scattering of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre
so now the question is up to you are computers good for people or not
did you know that computers are the number selling electronic device in the world
when dies on the side of the cliff by when he launches the huge rock over board
my first reason includes friends and family
the mood is a mixture of both happy and sad because of the way the author states his ideas
from all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout
in that book it describes kidnapping and the rape of young girls
however the truth of the matter is that some people spend way to much time on the computer
that is the second reason why i think computers are good for people
and he could just be a bum
you can also feel lighter and better about yourself you will be more active
in fact computers are so useful and helpful teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms
in the evening i play cricket in the park with my friends
computers have led to many dangers
last reason is it can help you be organize and get a job
i live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well
censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing
then our teacher read out lovely stories
think of everything you would lose everything you could never get back or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future
the visit was an unforgettable experience
some people ran get in trouble for fooling around on the web
music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language so they make an effort
put these offensive books in libraries then
many books that be found offensive are historical
computers do benefit society because they are fun a source of communication good for schooling and education and for work
the internet a powerful weapon but can teens handle this kind of power
dear newspaper have you ever wanted to see your that lives across the country
a computer has endless information on any topic unlike books
i got the signature from the characters in my autograph book and also i took photographs with the characters
this would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning
computers are made it do all to help us learn
if i had a story to tell and i spent a long time working on it
the advances in technology have proven the sky have the limit the invention of planes
jupiter is the biggest planet among all of them
i truly believe that the planet would be better with out computers
its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself
i could drop from heat stroke another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is
a lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them
you the work on the computer
those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
if i find something very offensive in a store or online i should have the right to voice my opinion and that opinion should be taken seriously
i know that i think they are a great to we are lucky to have them
so you mostly spend about  or  as fix it
at the end of the row on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution
in the  modern day  did just that
last week i went to my uncle’s house in green park
i am one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find the book offensive
for example internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else
so this is why i believe that having a computer is a good idea and good to have
last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends
which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem
dear local newspaper have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings
dear  everyone love computers right
i believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it
can when you would rather waste the computer other than outside and at least self
the cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke
is the new generation of mean
it is only natural to disagree with someone
if people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books
the author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope
how can one person say if something is wrong
the last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students
a family that i have been close to my whole life had moved to due to jobs
said a local resident
his parent did the very best they could for their family
the features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist
finally they are a major waste of money
but i think on people with computer such as talking to people who you cant see looking up information gives people something to do
then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better
okay to me people are way to moral in the modern world i was taught that if you have a problem keep it to yourself
i interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back she will have a new beginning
he grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight
when have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf
especially when you get older and have children
and that brings us to music
there were many different conditions that effected the cyclist
i really liked the adventure books such a the boxcar children and books like that
for example my grandparents live in 
you can with your friends email your peers and now there are website you can go on where you can talk to your friends or a stranger
he speaks softly to his patients
lastly they save us money
so our only option was the computer
computers are also fun
nothing can beat the feeling being with friends or family and just having fun
people say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike
but if we ever repeated that word while not reading it we would get sent down to the office
when i was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program i attended
most music should have a positive message to it
they also are incredibly out of shape
also you can use specific programs like or to create a cover page for a project or a presentation for your corporal business
first there was the fact of time
did i convinced you yet
if people gain the right to take books off shelves then music movies magazines will all get taken off shelves too
jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in minuets for less using the computer
will go down
soccer baseball basketball and lacrosse
the libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers
when we visit libraries we expect to find the information that we came there looking for
what would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish
on the subject of movies are some that should be censored like the movies containing extreme violence or gore
people all over the world do that just about everyday
this happens to many people in their sports
if someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could effect their grades a lot
for example many live on and her sister  she is very close to lives in 
offensive things are part of everyday life
usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it
computers are a great thing for everyone
libraries need to become a little more organized
another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people
we should have a say to what is in our public library
doing some sort of sport has another advantage
one day i was babysitting a little girl and i had taken her to the library
the theme of this story is adjusting to things in life
young parents i do believe is one of the reasons kids know about these movies books music and magazines
see i told you that they can ruin your life all it takes is a couple of hours to like the computer
this was an obstacle that he had to overcome
can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user
well when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf
ya not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff
my opinion is leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read
she missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it
when gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family
the library should keep certain books at the library such as the bible and collage books
litter kids would be like use to interact with some friends
 my name is and i am writing to you because i want to inform you about the benefits of having computers
another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading
after you have all of these you can connect with the rest of the world
dear local newspaper some people say computers have negative affects on family and friend others say computers are an important aspect of society
i think that movies and magazines should be censured to kids at the library
as you can see computers have many positive effect on people
of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to and happier kids do better work
the democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government
by having his heritage surrounding him his childhood was very pleasant
so this ride was torturous due to the setting
dear  i think that more people should start using computers
by marking movies with a rating and marking books with a specific age group it helps categorize them
he tactfully makes his student realize his mistake
par 
this quote is saying she will rise to her challenge and overcome it
well its so learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends
these machines help our world become an easier place to do
libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive
i was thinking the same way when i took a look at that website that got her started
in the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting
unlike the rebels going against it that is their own state of mind
nobody needs to be reading those kind of books it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people
this summer i took swimming classes with my friends
they spend their time watching pointless videos while they should be playing baseball or football
however her husband killed himself
young teenagers and children all enter a chat room online
we how you computers make life better and much easier
dear newspaper  are you aware that more than of families have ownership to a computer
my third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time
i would hate to do that
so does the heat from the sun
these are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and i hope you keep using them in our community
how would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong
people spend hours on computers talking to people
every book removed from the shelves is another learning experience taken away
this stuff is something that should be by ages and ages to come
it was also packed
affect the cyclist in many ways
you want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean
keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment
a person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others
that way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass because it will remind her of being home
i think that computers have a positive affect on people
another theme is to overcome your obstacles
everyone goes on the computer
the of the that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press
some of these books have historical meanings behind them
that kid would have nightmares for a week
all the body parts and organs work in coordination with each other
there where many different moods that the author created in the memoir
lastly the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world
when the hibiscus is budding then she will attempt the test again
my mother blessed me
i think that we should not even censor the content because i feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place
well i 
whenever someone needs to know something they just google it
such as or 
now i only see them about twice a year it is so quiet without them especially at my house
the computer is also fun and easy to use
there is something in each that strikes a spontaneous appreciation
lastly students that go to school and most importantly collage with no computers they wont be able to do their homework
i can even type my name in a research bar and find me and anybody else with the excel same name as me
nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
when people overuse the computer they can impact their education
the foods eaten there and what the weather is like
he learned the true meaning of family
there are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection
it is all caused by what they see or hear around them
they help each other out
one obvious reason for this evil is illiteracy poverty and unemployment
in libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books magazines or movies that children should be able to read
computers are a great thing to have
this is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test
his holidays and leisure hours are very few
the only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic
the reasons being 
there are big playgrounds on two sides and a beautiful garden in front
professor had this to say about how this is affecting 
in order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all
those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country and they should not have access to them
the author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the study in this way
first the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public
they are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling
people are able to read shop and play online
the answer is no
should censorship be allowed in libraries
this goes from kids to adults
this will make you a lot more friends
the answer is yes they should be different
this world wold be nothing without computers
when we take up a project we need a team of workers
many girls have gotten taken because of this
also computers can make things easier like typing
surely read on to see why computers are very important to us all
we would have computers but we wont use it like for along time then spend more outside
movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them
there are lots of benefits to having a computer to use
that content times of the year the world around her changed
dear  a 
at first it may cause us some pain or trouble to learn and appreciate discipline
if there ever was a need to really look at something and give another chance this would be the topic right here
this would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip
on the occasion of the fair and big meeting he maintains peace by applying for law and order
everyone comes to him to get something done
some books depending on the teacher have what some would consider offensive language and topics
we can do any activities with our family exercise for our health go picnic with friends or we have fun go on vacation with the whole family
making you your friends  family a whole lot happier
this shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started
my name is 
that be way many are over weight
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus
in the end the choice is really up to you
also he is running out of water
a video camera used on your computer
in some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed
i disagree i believe that it is bad for a few reasons
do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content
we miss out on all the other important things in life just because of to much time on our laptops
yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home
for example i would have a room for  and a room for 
safety is one the most important things in life
and some people get offended by some books or movies
it is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong
computer games only cost about and are instant access
now you even just simply get in bed turn on your lap top and take college classes right on your computer
first reason is freedom of the press
if they did not like the book or movie it is their fault for picking it in the first place
if someone discovers a book or movie that offends them they should not make a big deal about it
magazines in my opinion should be censored
is and was originally invented to keep in touch with family
must learn in order to teach
this quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test
but if a book talks about certain things it should be banned such as hate against other races or it talks negatively about someones religion
personal opinions are a part of books and we should respect that
for example children should be taught that there really are bad people in the world
he grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off
my grandmother takes care of our garden
please heed the following advice
finally computers also create many distractions to students
i just think if their is a certain amount of people complaining about a movie or song that their should not even be a fight about it
there are new additions daily
they can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs and can connect you to anything in the world
the web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers
i told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her
my parents are doing this to protect me and i agree with their decision
people need them for communication telephone numbers or facts about anything
for example near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill
sad because is hard to leave something behind
also if you had to look up a person for a school project
one experience i can think of that is a good example of this is when i was years old
this is how the author looks at his memories
dear local newspaper personal experience i think that computers have a positive effect on people
every years my dad takes me to the track in and times me for and yard dash the meter and the mile
i understand the fact that some people take things offensively
but if you went online and searched  you could find the traditions the clothing and so much more
the internet is a easy way to do research
some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently
finally people should stop using computers as much as they are now in order to keep their safety safe
imagine those kids the night before scribbling words away with their cramped hands typing to write as quickly as possible
there was a pond on both sides of the road
i believe that they should be taking off the shelves and you have to be or older to buy them in many reason
does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population
instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends teens should go outside and exercise
if these children do not listen we need to do something about it
i think the mood that is created by the author in this memoir is cheerful and welcoming
i have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors
censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries
i remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles
computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it
computers these days enable you to talk with friends do research and projects and let you book flights and buy cars
if parents find the materials that are within libraries offensive they should monitor their children while they are visiting their library
if my library had done its job and given me the guidance i sought i would have grown so much more easily
feature was the heat
instead of online shopping go shopping with your friends
you want to be at home on a computer all day or you want to be high energized and spending quality time with family and friends
something that is very offensive to one person not be offensive to someone else it is all a matter of values and beliefs
in deserts where there are no cows
we should teach people about them
also due to the high amounts of information online schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year
i can bet the number is going to be about of the time you are in you office
have you ever had someone move away and you wanted to keep in touch
and they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it
a student in saw their grades improve from a  to a  just spending less time on the computer and more
thank you for your time to read this i hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more
dear local newspaper i think computers have both good and bad effects on people
you could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet
paper burns at degrees 
the computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people
the author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him
as you can see computers can help students with projects etc
is an old family friend of mine
there are things like books that talk about sex
other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is
the author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied
it is a world someone loves to enter to hide or confide in
because of this he will probably rest first an old mans short tents again
this is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place
you can share the news or just have a conversation with anyone you know
she spends a lot time on the computer whether she likes it or not
some movies for children even have inappropriate things they might be hidden and the child not understand but it is still there
in the field of medicine and surgery science has made wonderful progress
like example they can read load and also they can do the same book with others words
the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader
when they say  they mean 
this is how i feel about this subject
saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance
we can not try to please everyone but it will never happen
when plants bud they are born
who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow
he does not bring his own bedding and we have to supply it at great inconvenience to ourselves
people often say that computers and technology are bad for you but yet i think they have helped our society out very well
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
nothing is censored like it was back in the day
that is why i think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting
when doing this they are typically 
the children are always ready to pick up a quarrel with anyone
to continue with computers help families by bringing them closer in a way
finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family and friends
to one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion
but the people that go to church just like to listen to church music
this test represents the achievement of adaptation to her new life
this is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people
computers have very benefits
the author could not accept her new country as home yet
magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them
it prevents freedom of expression
that are not appropriate for children
now lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends
having great coordination would mean that person would exceed past anybody who do not use computers
in our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency
when i get home she will normally be on 
the features of the setting affects the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy
she always works hard to give us a good education
people should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read
they make research easier and faster to find
most likely there were directing the story towards you so why get all worked up over something that has happen to you and take it out on the media
it is necessary for our society to have computers
some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie
computers help improve hand eye coordination and helps you learn
i think that they can help people with what they need
i come back home and finish my lessons
but these days he can find out anything
the first place he arrived at was a ghost town then he reach a water pump about twenty miles up the road
i love drawing
also the narration states she admitted to herself she much preferred it to a big macho
you should go hangout outside
also expressed the importance of family and friends
the main feature is the heat
such as taking a walk and enjoying nature
why should we take down the books in the library
if the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read
in conclusion computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light
it gives people a good education
then there is music
in a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read
second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world the world
these are only three of the main moods in the story
i carried a bag and went to school with my father
those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad
but think are they really helping us
books are one of the most important things that we have in world
today in our society many things can be taken in many different way
this local market has made our lives very easy as all daytoday items are available at a comfortable distance
go see what you can find
firstly computers hinder interpersonal connections
dear local newspaper i believe that computers have a coolest effect on people
being off the computer feels better and is better
finally the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist
you can do this with computer which would probably even be more entertaining than a boring ad book from the library
how will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned
libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible
it should not be put into more mature movies and music such as movies with adult content and rap
also computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily
it shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower
if faced with these obstacles i would have been affected in the same way
you either go break out the old atlas or with a simple click of a button on the computer discover that the capital is 
where would we get all of our information from
in the story road ahead exceed posted speed limit the rider runs into a large highway sign jumped out at me it read rough road
what kind of influence is that on the children
my family has gone to many different areas around the world
when an author is writing setting the mood is really important
therefore never depend on the internet as a source of research
no history will be know but what is passed down
dear local newspaper are computers a bad thing
you have a choice to read or watch something
a house consists of roof walls doors and windows
in the memoir the author creates a happy mood
therefore it was not removed
items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it
if books and or materials are removed from the shelves that can hide so much useful information that people could gain
experts say that the computer restricts time to workout but in all truth the computer is the key to the gym
so many people rely on technology to get through there life
know being safe is important
the author could write a sequel to this one
any of these things could happen to you so i advise you not to use a computer
although other things have affects on youth books are a different story
surrounding it there are nine main
at this point children our taking it very serious  and strongly believing they can do the same 
as soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go he set off through tall cool pines
in our  we are given the right of writing what we want and if censorship continues we will lose one of our rights
computers have helped so many people do so many things
you could send emails to your cousin half way across the world
they have no time to study at night because they spend all their extra time on the internet
it can come from the parents their friends teachers anybody
she preferred horror movies and i historical
everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive
exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports you should jog a couple times of day
then we saw rhinos and giraffes
the author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus
not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else
say no cause you computer
if disliking the book is a problem then put it back
hundreds of thousands of people play online games everyday
therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out
from what i know
some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project
when i get home i start using the online text book for my math class
i was so exited
that is when i say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are for you
they found two boxes in the adjacent park
the features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways
i could get a book removed because it offends me
you could be getting other tasks done
there are many people that think that the lyrics of those songs are just terrible and offensive
finally the internet helps people connect
by libraries exposing children to derogatory music they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families
if the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music and movies they should possibly be fired
many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is
my attentions for letting him read it are for all the right reasons
who can say what is offensive to everyone
the internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life
while pedaling through desert the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed which is always a symbol of a deserted area cones by
the mood is proud because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are  how inviting the house was
there are over on computer games online
you need the computer so you can print picture for your report
to the press
the library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material
finally reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for directions
some think everything should be a little cleaner others think different
sometimes we have family that lives long distance no one wants to pay for a call so we have the internet to connect
also another way that would help stop offensive viewing is parents looking at what their children are reading watching and listening to
  this was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite raise
the little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us
yes i believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone
try opening a book
he had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat
how does she feel about it
like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else
these amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation
if your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the is a sure easy thing
so lets face it computers are important
those books movies and magazines that are offensive are enjoyable to me
some passengers were polite and some were rude
in this time try and find a good action movie without cuss words in it
no it not
one way was when he was describing the warmth music and cooking in his house
knowing you have people who are like family is incredible
another danger computers have is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone
the hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland
he should get up early
the people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked
second people do not spend as much time on the computer they get more experience with social skills
it is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of  hours of their free time on a computer
therefore in the end books should be censored
some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer
a friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her blinding her from what she should have known
so why would we allow this book to be in the library
then when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over
they made paper boats and started floating them
they also say that they are not interacting with family and friends
cause either way they going to be able to find away to get it
everyone in this world is different from the next person
like i said before one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it
dear  i think that children are spending to much time on the computer for the wrong reasons
while this seemed a fair stance to take the parents then took things a step further
it could most likely cost you or even family members your lives
from school to work to just fun
like anything computers have downsides too
with video chat you can show off new  or newborn baby
many people use computers
for example my cousin is in a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat
learning is a good thing for adults an children
the terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills the more he would drink
pickpockets have their day at such hours
all of these things happened back to back without giving him a break so it really tired him out
when he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad
whenever i look in magazines i just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes food and people
i went to see this fair with my friend last week
millions even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers
furthermore typing is a mandatory class for many freshmen and previous experience is very helpful to the teachers and students
like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories
so use the time on the computer better
they will be able to do sample everyday asks much better
then i took a round of the platform
without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight
i can understand wanting to shelter your children but you cant keep them from every thing
there a lot of reason in which computers are bad
that their child watches change it
 the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist
this is not what the author wants
libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed
that is my only ambition
i got most things done and in a matter of time
books are so very important to us and our world
you can do all this on the computer and more
also when you have chores to do what will happen to them
so for the censorship towards different groups of people there will have to be some tolerance
the cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to 
if i was on the computers all the i would be able to enjoy
even though computers do have pros and cons they have more pros
if we start controlling each others thoughts feelings and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding
he pedals great distances trying to find towns nearby
of all that i have observed i have found similar things as my experiences
this makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home
the authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read hear or watched by people that are interested in them
they will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library
this gives the cyclist his main conflict the lack of water
my final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games watch movies or homemade videos and even talk to friends
placing these certain materials in their own section is the best way to go to benefit everyone
lastly computers help people make money and support their family
he is a selfless person
with a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them
she will take that drivers test then
even though you know its not there but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you where looking for
the answer is never
i mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy

movies are censored due to language and content which i get but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen
are so many things out in the society today that can offend people and what might majorly offend one might have no effect on the other

i am going to hit points on what i think about the subject

he ran into snakes and very deserted country
they have seen blood gore and other things in these games and movies

the content of a library should be full of various material even if one find certain materials offensive
nor a car person or building in sight

on the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games
the train arrived
if not for advances in technology people could make me right decisions
all we know is when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then i will take the test again
the author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope
the mood of the memoir is generally happy
the hot dry and baron setting affect the cyclist greatly
we barely understand what some of the books music movies and magazines are talking about so just try to picture all that being taken away
art has had naked people in it for thousands of years
how do you feel
these different optical affected his mood and how determined he was
on to next subject the expert say were not enjoying out doors but the over looked something here it is
also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off
these were some elements that effected the rider on his trip
alright no body is home or online i think going to kick back turn some music to kick back turn some music on and maybe take a nap
they have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them
they loved many people who they knew they could trust
she listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun she used to be
he did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him
so we took our umbrellas and set out
they gave him a feeling of confidence and physically cooled his body down
she is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture
also they have games for computers that people get hooked on
people should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside
so in all i would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society
many libraries possess on their shelves books and magazines and even music containing explicit material and how could you avoid it
what are some of your feelings about computers
he also says how grateful he is for his parents
i could drop from a heatstroke he says
studies show that over of children use computers for some sort of school work
we learn so much information from all sorts of books
instead go to a book store and buy whatever you need there
though granted our society is certainly not headed for that any time soon if ever it is still a valid point
even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas
yes that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me
libraries have things for people of all ages even though some do not like many of the materials found in them
the hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store the geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter
the features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways
i believe there should be some censorship to some extent
finally there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive
if you can use your eyes and your hands at a you can hit a baseball or even
for example a person of higher authority find a particular book magazine or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs
computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets
 computers offer many learning opportunities
computer also take precious time away from exercise
censorship should not even exist
is a tool that of our nations used
addition itself is a serious health issue
also it shows the determination all living things have to succeed at their main purpose
relies on the computer to talk to his loved family
so before you make your decision thing would you want it done to you
talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way
computers are a hundred percent health for you
plus it was hilly
to support a claim like this i will provide evidence
people can chose to quit listening to a song quit watching a movie or quit reading a book or magazine that they find offensive
he ran to a wayside boutique
another is for books on certain people or events
each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive
friends and family are not people to take advantage of
they can learn about far away places
dear local newspaper writer i believe that computers benefit our society because we could connect to people more faster and easier
getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it
although some people find certain items unoffensive other disagree
also people can use computers to talk to people living close or far away from you
kids rely on them for studying or homework
he does it with love another mood in the article
well i from personal experience my social studies teacher always likes you to type your final draft
its not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases but its not about what they like
i hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society
they overburden themselves with work
he also said that it was not safe to get off the jeep
so have an adult section and a kids section
so now hes riding and angry that he took their tips
finding the plant helped her because it was already familiar to her
one reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring
right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that
throughout rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist
without this type of setting the story would have completely changed
when you type a paper for school you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct
without it how were you going to get your info
this shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now
violence in books seem to spread across schools
this tells how the narrator is thankful
whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide
i think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth but keep it at a bare minimum
even though the computer has lots of things and it is very interesting
it also sopped the energy out of him further complicating his ride
computers seem to be the talk of the year
many people are always on one of those instead of talking in person
people could see where something is locate it or learn about the place
we might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful
well how people do shopping online there are hundreds even thousands sites that offer great sales
becoming overweight has many health risks liked heart other
computers are too important and beneficial to lose
children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines books and movies
so now he has no cool water to drink when he says not two miles into the next section of the ride i noticed the terrain changing
just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game
dear readers i understand that some think computers can effect peoples lives
these really do not need to be exposed to our young children because
the language was not meaning to be used offensively but simply to state how people talked and how things were when was alive
i suggest that people should just leave the books wear they are at
the real question is what are we limiting
this whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things
it is true and if one is physically fit it leads to his mental health
but if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem
it be fun but it could also but your health
you can also talk to different people who like you
this also be help with reading and understanding big words
it is important for a student to read  and the works and 
the author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life
he felted loved because his parents sacrifice for him
the author goes to describe his family which were loving but poor
computers have become the most helpful source of technology
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
rafters and timber from my trunk
and that is schoolwork
people always doubted him and never gave his music a chance
and to tap that off he drinks water that tastes like battery acid
although many people think that a certain book is appropriate others disagree
once she sees the plant in bloom shell know that she can take the test again
whenever wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with play computer
if there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested
now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors the library
i can never play with other people with online multiplayer
everyone is different in their own way
we could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold
people have different opinions what one find extremely offensive another not care or even laugh at it
that is the mood created by the author in this memoir
their are search engines that you can find your topics on
the author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance
it will do this by giving her strength or comforting her
so she says that she wants to retake the test
your choices are endless
there are different kinds of channels that view these materials
this would not be good for the cyclist because he would be able to get water for his trip
the desert was also hot and dry
the inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible
authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library
firstly a mood that the author sets is warmth
first being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the 
all the descriptions of his family cooking and family neighbors eating together is enough to make anyone feel happy
thank you for listening
posting pictures on the and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse
one feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat
the author shows that he learns family and is very thankful to his parents for that
i hope you agree with me
also they cut communication with your family making it rare to truly bond with them
the computer is a wonderful thing
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things i learned there about how to love
there are no other human beings cars or buildings for miles
threats were found online from big websites like   
censorship is kind of out of the way
no two people think the same
they also help us be different and more creative people
most importantly there is less interacting with friends and family
there are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to when you can just look up pictures of 
the author created a close relationship mood while he was writing his memoir
the mood created by the author is very happy and grateful throughout the memoir
i no stupid rules right
people should restrict computer usage among themselves to a of an hour even less if you can
first reason is that all books and contents that a public library offers to the community should be open to everyone
go learn what you want right now
is right to have censorship in libraries
why should libraries have one
offensive material to people is like a good book you can read and learn more about
however is not the only person who agrees
all the teachers like him and praise him for his work
well you could go on the computer
another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments
internet sites like extremely useful
i thought i had secured her in her bedroom to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke
next i believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries
also it mite help some crime to stop to
there are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things
if you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained you can go on or other sites and find any song you want to hear
the computer helps us learn about other places in the world
a book magazine movie etc are all gateways to new worlds where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is
hello my name is  i feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries
what is censorship
some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects
like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short rolling hills
also the less the library contains the less people go
i could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here
here are some reasons why
this is much like how our libraries are becoming
obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the and it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day
libraries are to help people with information fun facts and all around good resources
i do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer but it still has a totally positive effect on people the world
how could something so harmful possibly be good for our society
computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made
with the click of your mouse you can check to see who won the presidency or what shows are on tonight
and so local newspaper that is why i am writing you this letter today
so why not advance and invest in the music industry it will provide entertainment and fun for years to come
it is situated in south delhi
as well as the library the movie store and everything else
let us make reading a regular habit and so become a creative member of the world community
it is very hard to become addicted to the 
people can disagree no one has to agree with anything anyone says
all in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material
how much hurt can someone take from a book popular music a movie or even a magazine etc
it is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them
no one stopped him
and then she states that their wont be any books left for us
he even told the concerned people what he expected to get
students can grab their laptop and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends
online gaming has become an sensation and not only an  and  and can game too
a drama was staged
for example in fifth grade i did a research project on 
people have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in 
if something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against i believe that the book or books should be removed
just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer
i believe that almost of kid are on the computer because they have nothing to or it is addicting
one of the more recent games for these consoles is called of 
libraries are for people to check out books or other sources and not to remove books or other source off the shelves
computers keep children inside all day
they just do not feel comfortable fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them
the word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze
they can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored
computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide
once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore
reading using computers working at a table
the author says that in his community many different cultures came together and help each other through racism and other tough times
computers have a positive effect on people
not all magazine have something that can be use to educate
some of the most interesting books to read are about murders i think
did you know that you can literally but from on your computer
the advantage in technology has provided many new ways for family and i to communicate with each other
yes maybe computers are away time with family but what about or in that you have at to in over a year
i believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials
email   etc
people also do not get to spend as much as their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family
to achieve all these essentials a basic economic independence of all citizen is a must for democracy
also others complain that people need to more out in nature
there was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water
the more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be
the ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling
the author creates many moods in the story
did you look up to any of the main characters
my final reason why the use of computers is good because people can interact with their family and friends online
is very grateful for how things turned out
they go on to say
there are many ways to do this
everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers
also you cant understand what there saying half the time
everyone likes to drink orange juice
the computer is a great easy way to keep organized
also the snow represents a blanked of the past  hard times
i want to ask them how do they survive without one
since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be amazing thing to another person
sometimes these things should not be on the shelves
certain materials should be removed from the shelves
in closing overusing your computer can cause health problems put your safety at risk and hurt your education
of course you  everyone does
than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want
dear  in your newspaper i read an article that sparked my interest
the are thousands of games to chose from
the biggest question in my eyes is  deems that material as unsuitable for libraries
as the author cycles through this shortcut he is in a very dangerous setting
therefore they began to build houses
he talks about how everyone was an immigrant and faced segregation but were always willing to lend a helping hand
we will not be a respected nation anymore
if someone does not like the material they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it
computers are a very good thing for kids to have
and the best part having family near by
can be offensive in some way
objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while
most of these books give a prospective on real life stories and be able to help someone cope and realize that they are not alone
i think you learn everything from your parent how to act and all that
with this kids and adults are communicating in high end ways that waste too much time
my freshman year we read and 
you probably used a computer
the only thing you can to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book
she will make it
in short we call it a ‘bike’
there are three main things that can get you in shape
when communicating with people on the computer the writer tends to short hand things
another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
people are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear
some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting
the way an author tries to entertain offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone
the features effect the setting of the story in a big way
they might not even test it anyways
i believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing
i also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf
in conclusion there are many people that or not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion
computers is what we use to live we need them to survive
he has no proper place to live
in many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story
some people think computers are the lives of many people but i have to disagree with those who say that
everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books
adults would most likely be playing a rated game and watching rated movies
you can have intelligentand its easy and free
common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material
one of my personal experiences is that i love music so do my two best friends
 his view on things
computers are also in some electronics
are some rare examples
if people find the profanity in the song offensive then do not listen to it
at this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation
respectable and an example to others
children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information
no more books music movies and magazines
my parents believe that i am at the right age that i should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music i want to
books music movies and magazines have bad messages or nudity but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them
what are we hiding from
a customers needs and wants should be met at all times unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own
dear newspaper have you ever grabbed a nice cold cake and sat at your computer desk
therefore you can interact online
the mood in the story is very homely and happiness
to  my name is i am from 
books are another thing that could use some censorship
one of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at
good health is the greatest blessing of god
i know i have
there are hundreds of stories in the world classics which tell us many immortal comradeships
you might be able to get rid of a few but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them
would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window
suddenly spoke and said  are people so cruel
i believe in freedom of thinking because it is the most valuable resource that we have it is what sets us apart from each other
yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself
did you know that is recording everything you do online
dear newspaper in my opinion i think computers do benefit society
when she is more stable in the culture get still has a firm grasp of her own then she will be ready
but for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts
just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is offensive to everyone
all of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay
but computers cannot simulate fresh air and exercise
not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book which is why i was so shocked when i heard about this strange news
dear local newspaper i believe that people should stay with computers
the mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents
going to like school libraries for books i think it really depends on the age group
it is this positive happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive
say no computers
of all he talks about his family and the love they shared
have you ever hopped on the computer and played a game
the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus
this moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check
were not thinking about what power teens have with the internet
i have a computer at home and i know how much fun it is talking to your friends on or whatever you talk to your friends are
what happens if a hurricane is abroad and a family has no idea of its presence
we should respect him
letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over
the unemployed are required to register with these
computers are also used in schools to help students with their work even teachers use the computer for grades
being a daughter and teenager myself i personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines
not letting them hear see or read the bad in the world
just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive
the people who spent most of their time on the computer are the people who are addicted
my final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress
last i checked the is a democracy
we gossip about them
people cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language
others tend to choose not to do their homework and work on their social life on the computer instead
she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now
when a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it then the book usually is taken off of the shelves
with internet you can do things like play games research information and even talk to friends and family all through a computer
in a culture like the one we have  censorship usually takes the back seat
but everything was in a real mess
computers are testing away people enjoying nature
whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project we all use computers
she felt a sense of security in conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start
thus goes on the season’s cycle
well you can be done with the hours of looking if you just use a computer then you can get outside and play games
most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children
first reason is they teach hand eye coordination give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
what he was saying was he was grateful to his parents for what they did for him so that makes me feel thankful for my parents
you can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise
it keeps me up to date with currents
in life we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face
studies show that a paper is faster than writing out
because of overpopulation there is poverty
shes sure she will do better next time
it can our spirit when we are depressed
first i will state why i think the books or movies or whatever should be taken off the shelf
alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important
depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provides the thing you want
he is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird
the hibiscus she bought was away to comfort her
imagine what it would be like if we expanded this right to the foods that we buy
for example many people use the computer to chat with their friends
this would make it very difficult to interact and make new friends
the features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony
it has change the world
if we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad
computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways
one feature is the hot weather and area he is in
would we still be today
he says with any luck id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth
if books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now
it was easy to find out how life was in  thanks to the actual girl explaining it
a library is built for the education of the public not for the interests of one person
he laughed at how long ago those men must have been here
then she will be ready to achieve her goal
i know not all people are literate but maybe visiting a library once in awhile would help them with it
this makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher
obesity is not a hard thing to get rid of
dear are a major part in everyday life
families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities
please use computers to help our everyday routine
also has spell check you could email it to someone or even change the font color size of the font and much more
back then and now censorship is hiding reality
for example on paragraph  says he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices
all because of a movie or book
its not such a far fetched idea
in the end computer can help kids adults or teenagers
this can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken
then he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like battery acid
have you ever been assigned a report and wait till the last minute to get it started
though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages
in a library you have the right to have an open mind
after all the freedom of speech is written in our rights
these documents should be high profile secure areas
he wanted to end the story on a positive note
but i think that we need to find a balance between the two
they have freedom of speech and we have a right to know
to always look at the map
at this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water while knowing he has another miles to go
any time my friends and i have a question about anything anything that happened that day
next i believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting are children watch every and anything they want too
this opened my eyes and now i too am grateful for everything and everyone i have in my life
computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports
so my simple solution is obvious
yes computers are fun giving but is bad
there has always been a sense of subliminal messaging throughout the development and evolution in the cinematic world of movies
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered scared thirsty and cause him to worry
i felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir
like which country is which
there is two things that are going to happen
the school has even started doing something very new allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online
although technology namely computers can be a wonderful thing we need to look at the downside
if it were a magazine they might look at it
but all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful
many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things such as drugs
i say happy because the author was happy to enjoy having so many friends and family to come over everyday and have fun
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind as told by the man
i do not really understand that
most reading teacher will have you read a book and then type a essay or a review about your book
i am not complaining about this because i understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to
we could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to make the community as a whole 
so what are you waiting for
just be glad that you know about it now
in some places books that are banned to other places are celebrated
the hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination
so in conclusion i think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this
computers are good for society because people use computers to talk to friends and family on  and 
winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist
it is not reality
therefore students children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting
the last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road
that is why i think the mood the memoir creates is love
nearly eight feet high
even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book moviemagazine music etc
action strategy puzzles and many more
 i believe that we should tell the people of about the dangers of using computers too much
first it be a book movie or magazine that someone plans on reading and removing an item will let down the customer
five years ago i had to move from to 
if a family with young children want to go to the library the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children
need to stop the computer with adults
do you find books you read offensive
dear of  technology seems to have a positive effect on people
there is a wide array of music that people can enjoy
computers are great
for example writing on essay their science fair project and so on
there are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well
the song writers singers publishers and authors who write this material have the freedom to do so
he would do this day after day
when he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad thirsty and tired
the interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly
we must as a society be able to accept this
who are we to fault the people of the and for how that articulate words
in the story
if its not to overweight to not spending time with families to doing schoolwork
by the very dry climates
computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly
there is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something
 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and i agree with them
two minds are better than one
she looks and researches it
i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends
after riding through the desert the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop but all of them were ghost towns
you have to control under the books
today obesity is a major problem
the computer has endless knowledge
lastly all the people who their imagination off computers all those people who put that thoughts and feelings into the computer
music will always be out there
for some reason computers had a lot of effects on people
they also allow you to talk to people even if they are far away
another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their biological parents or siblings
learning the harsh realities of our society educates people allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them
we can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material
florence worked day and night and put everything right within a few weeks
the mood in this memoir is happy and joyful
the games are also fun and non violent
at times people do not close the taps open
another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction
it can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song
in that point of view you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves
many people still like the old tradition of traveling to libraries and starting the quest for the perfect book
as a result computers would improve the way we learn
here he describes how the people in his neighborhood acted towards each other
this helps keep our country safe from invasion and war
therefore i think if you like doing that then the computer is what you need
the author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again
sometimes using the computer could be educational
if adults want to view pornography or read accounts of extreme violence that is their business
as the seasons went by she discovered the similarities
there is no civilization or natural water source so he faces dehydration
i found out how to do it and it worked
 it is now possible study without of the  can be done on the internet online
in that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book you will find a number of people that would read the book
should offensive material be removed from the library
removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge
in addition computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do
the author created many types of moods in this 
the sun was beginning to beat down
lead to civil war between the northern states and the southern states
we cannot see air
if the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items
i will now like to elaborate my reasons further
i use the computer to talk with friends and family to help with my homework and i am still active
the same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music
the way i look at it is is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions
although some novels not be appropriate for certain people censorship in libraries is not they way to fix that and it is a big mistake
finally the temperature whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water  being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist
it creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things
things such as computers are a main cause of lacking exercise interaction with family and friends and is also a possible danger to ones mental health
 the author makes him seem proud of himself
then their would nothing left for people to read
in my opinion i think that some people use and rely on computers too much
they can also go swimming play sports and go to a play ground
censorship is taking away our freedoms and  slowly stealing them away from us
my first reason i think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs
the people it helps are kids in school to look up an area they need to find for a question on a worksheet
told me if your on the computer for hours on the computer for hours straight your eyes can get worst
this was great and i though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends
if its all down hill its really easy but all uphill is hard level terrain is fairly easy
those people that are offended need to put whatever is down and move on
if kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it
censorship is a terrible thing for libraries
and a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world
talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another but computers again are preventing this
last of all members of the library would have the same right as the librarians
if we do not then usage will increase there will be no chat problems and peoples money will get stolen
sohan is my nextdoor neighbor
what you have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button
i would rather have a few offensive books then none at all
technology is a beautiful thing indeed
she want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past 
we thanked god that we had landed safely
this point is a simple and logical one
a library is a place to go read study complete homework assignments etc
these were some reason why you should not use the computer
the stories are obviously important to the author and important to the readers that enjoy their books
on this issue the other readers opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked
first of all the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult
people have different cultures and beliefs
just a thought
in the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong
then i have also seen accounts where people have been changed in a good way because of a book
he is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go
i take a bath dress up and then i eat my breakfast
a student write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual
sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship
how can you tell when someone is of a mature age
it was rather large but i had come to love reading in that time of my life so i decided i was up for it
so spread the word for the sake of thousands of people
even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person
minds of human beings are too complexly separated
like learning about far away places and people
first reason is they give the ability to learn about people and places in the world
the setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways
in this memoir there are moods created by the author in the memoir
i think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section
the use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important
that goes for movies music magazines books and more
many kids even myself would rather be online than read a book or do homework
magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf
to remain young in spirit isolate yourself completely and meditate
others are concerned that people spend too much time on them
i had to find a lot of info so that also means a lot of books and a lot of reading
to who it concern you take away books because someone might find them offensive
in places like the fort railway station a large television
but i disagree
history is a big part of life that everyone one should know
it has a long thin body and flower collecting nectar from them
in libraries there is usually an adult section and kids section
so as you can see computers benefit society because you can learn all types of things online
for every people when join a social page get worse grades do to this issue
keep on the shelf
and i still feel the same way about the music as i do with books
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
also she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table
computers can educate people from learning about some ancient person to doing school projects
i was reading out of a magazine yes the magazine is intended for adults but i obtained the skill to read from it
if you find a book or anything like that hard to deal with it is crazy
the second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect
books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children
the mood that was created the is a happy loving mood
sometimes the articles in books are old and
when surveyed the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night
they help students do there school work
this memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling
you could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house
this allowed not only them to be happy but for other people to share their happiness with them
if they can publish them then we should be able to read them no matter what our age is
movies are greatly responsible to make many people take the path of crime by making crimes attractive
what would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you
it has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people
i also learned how to row a boat to show my class how crossed the river i learned that by taking on online course
my conclusion is that people should not to be able to get off of computer
or in rare cases the parents are the cause of it
they talk to kids until they find out something like an address phone number school and district
this is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas
fiction books are the first books children know how to read this is where they start their reading skills
you can find worse hear worse just by walking down the street just about anywhere
a computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people
when the hibiscus is buddingbeing reborn she will take the test
but why stop there
that is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf
a third reason is that they end up offending some people by removing a book
people will always have their own views on everything
it is much more fun to be with someone in real life then to talk with them online
these people get not enough exercises which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well
people should use a more often
the internet is a major part in having computers
might takes some month to learn but once a child knows  they will be outside for hours
many people like different books music movies and magazines
i was so thrilled when i was finally able to check out the book and read it
but i believe that they should not have to take books music magazines etc
she helps me to understand and learn my lessons easily
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
computers are a good way to help with your skills
also the computer is very distracting
this could effect peoples education and reading skills
so in conclusion that is my opinion on this
i explained to her in the best of my ability the life of and this was important to me
unfortunately friend was  and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment
and that concludes my or should i say your next top story
that to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now
the song inspired many of the famous singers you know
the setting had a great effect on the cyclist
i check it almost everyday when i come home from school
social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making or a page
also because no video store exists in the town i live in i go to the library for movies because i know they have a large selection
the problem was i forgot what it was
the last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains
as a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown
some people even use the computer for a job
they would never of learned such things
there are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it
his mood is warm and compassionate as he talks about how much each one of his community was important to him
most of the time it was just about a group of people who love each other having a good time with each other
dear local newspaper experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while
it seems to me that people need different activities to get them off the computers
that last paragraph was quite vital to the theme and meaning of the story
they also have music that has explicit lyrics on the 
freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation
i believe it is our right to read and publish what we want
and the biggest detail you want to know is the cost and the computer can usually give you a close to exact price for everything
but if someone has to write a report on  it would be best to have as much information on him as possible
i have a computer but i can only go on if after i finish my homework
i think that computers have a good effect on people
this helps people stay connected
the reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed
the mood created by the author is touching
second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project a computer help
when these old forsaken things one mentioned it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair
technology is there to make the world a happier  healthier and more social place
this caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather directions he was given and lack of water
another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down
another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story
computers can really be bad with our education
i felt very alone and stupid
they need to get outside and see the outside world people should interact with family and friends
as the cyclist gets further and further he has more doubt
maybe other people like that kind of music or etc
is censorship in libraries a problem or a right
if you take every offensive word out of a book chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it
for example when shes in the greenhouse it takes her back to her childhood it was like walking into another world
well some people already are throwing their lives away
all books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people
if you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online
people have many different views when it comes to these things
she bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her
in my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done
the rider says the sun was beginning to beat down
all of these sites allow you to find family members friends and many more
research things that they have never known
if a person wants to buy their own music artists are required to make two of the same album one with censors and one without
happiness was showed in many different ways
this indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance
then their on the internet out doing their job
another breathtaking adventure that you miss out on is hiking
you newer know what would happen
it is a free choice to read a book regardless of what it says
doing exercise is good for your health
it distracts people from their life
just one computer can enlighten you with so much
on the internet course
what about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things
we have a small market near our house it is our local market
to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest
even though i feel this way about inappropriate books i understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship
first i highly agree with the people who think computers are useful
so give them time limits
i hope you can see why we need computers
there are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way
the mood created in this memoir is love and unity
i know in my experiences i have found some things that were offensive so i am sure that they are out there
she lived in a close community were helping hand was always there if needed
a researcher showed that computers you can chat  i think computers has affects on all
of people use computers to do their informational work about faraway places
from the people who are gaining weight every day because the sit on the computer and chat all day
this affects him because cant get water from the well
whether it be sexual or even political if the reader finds it offensive they will not read the rest of the book
and i hope to that you start living it healthier
some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer
now she can be prepared
are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some
in the  many more people are becoming obese creating unhealthy genes to be passed on
a computer can help you very much in this type of case
last but not least you could just enjoy it
if a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it
if they are found offensive then that is not my problem
then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water
so he was affect in a lot of different ways not just one
removing all of these offending books you would basically be removing half the books in the library
the writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences
everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out
it sure has happened to me but you know what i do
blood disorders such as high blood pressure and diabetes can cause you to have a heart attack
or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework
computers effect people for sure but not in a way that people would want to be effected
but then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself
for example if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes would you be upset
without computers life would be difficult and stressful
so in ones opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well
this all happened because he listened to the old guys
they were arguing about something
there are many other words to describe the mood but togetherness describes the family as a whole
they might start it lost minute
it can be shipped to your door without going anywhere
everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries
finally its addicting some people could good hours and hours on the computer looking up all these videos
for a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives
lastly when kids miss their favorite shows one day they can just look it up the next day to get caught up
so if you need to find a job then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you
a few years ago kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library
example is it helps students with homework
because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up
music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life
there is always something wrong with something
the cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way
to me things would possibly change if we get all the naughty things out of bookmagazinesmusic
i hate to go look at nature
a big thing with this is race and culture
one is the bad weather
its not fair to the author
your wasting your time on the computers
if people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that then what are they still here for
please help defend us kids in this case about computer use
there was a downpour for a short while but soon it turned into a steady raining
you can get some weights and exercise in your room
i think having books that are too offensive should be put in there own bookshelves
next not everyone online is who they say they are who make false accounts on like or 
i do believe everyone including myself spends a lot of time online
the desert setting also affects the cyclist mind
he took me along
put a and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have just to solve the age problem
they are useful to every one
computers also allow students to email teachers in case missed classes and assignments
thank you for your time 
most people instead of taking action will be on the computer
i do not have to be on computer websites like and here is why
so she got a webcam and now everyday they talk and her dad gets to see the baby
at a movie rental store you would expect to find movies that are adult but not in a public library
also you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing
to whom it concern i think computers are a good thing
another is when the author says she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched against the evening sky slowly fading to the distance
it just on how you view it
many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences
sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience
people like to listen to music on their or while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it
so you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project
how can you spend more time with your family
its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me
who has forgotten about the past
in libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be
it was a chocolate cake with juicy cherries on the top
people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music
does that really mean we should get rid of them though
you stayed home both times just to be on the computer
decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the during time period
then as soon as the believers in hear about it
 the people agree with what stated
i personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing
what has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions
as you can see entertainment is everywhere on the web
how could so much knowledge be named unhealthy or have a negative effect on people
when example of happiness was that his parents passed on their culinary skills and a love of cooking
i think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature
computers are not the way to go
it made it very difficult for him to finish his ride
students can be encouraged to do some kind of social work during holidays
for example the other day my mom was checking her email and came access the stay of a young starving
you can even be really social and meet new people as long as your safe
welcome to the future
in conclusion the cyclist in the end found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in
today many libraries have a variety of books movies music and magazines to choose from
plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work
i believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home she states that she failed the drivers test
as a result computers are the blame
computers are necessary for reasons
we will try to plant a tree whenever we can
one must actually be outside experiencing the feel the smell and even the taste of nature
but you just can not for get about those books you have to watch what they are reading
the others are either buying things or playing games
there are lots and lots of arguments over the censorship of books and how they could affect children
i showed her what the book was called  
think of what not having a censor on the libraries can cause
so women just had a baby  she is using her computer to work online
computers in schools help to increase the amount learning our children
children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though
the greatest difference between our country and a totalitarian government is the simple freedom allowed in the 
i think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways
there are pros and cons to computers but manly cons
we require water for different purposes
some were discussing the law and order problem while others were discussing the rising prices
one reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers
my first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them
computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability
from stocks to instant messaging  people have based important decisions in their life based on what they have read
so if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone
and they still do
computers were you people but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you
if they decide to take books off the shelves why not just have an adult section in the library
walking in and  we see books music and magazines lining the walls most containing explicit material
the problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer most of them are teens
i believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight
there are all kinds of books out there and no two books are the same
try neighborhood activities
that way if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check
some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education
i feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again
the essay takes place in the early summer
parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries
this is the mood created in this excerpt
if everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others
another thing you could do is play free games or download the game from the internet do your computer so they are both fast and easy
people deserve to read watch or listen to anything that they want
and basketball keeps you quick and always running
they live across the whole other side of the world
people just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter
this would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event
libraries not many people like them but most people do
there is no longer a need to interact with other life forms nor is there a want to
one much life is exercise and due to the of modern computers exercise is the key to a healthy life
to find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news
has it really helped us
one example was in paragraph 
that is the mood and some examples created by the author in the memoir
this combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling and almost pushing him to death
when using your computer you could be working out or exercising and this causes obesity
therefore the mood is happy and warm i would love to be there
if the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines books movies or music is it right for them to grab it away
that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
i wish only to be a scholar and i am glad i am trying hard for the same
so as you have read i gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives
using this i keep in touch with my  my friend who moved and even a friend from 
but why do some people think that it is hurting our society
i think that a library should be a nice quiet welcoming
he beat his mom and cut her body open leaving the insides on the outside lawn
you never have to worry about not knowing whats going on
taking away their entertainment would be the same as telling them that they cannot wear the clothes they would like or drive the car they want
the other day my friends and i wanted to go see a new movie that just came out
in conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive
the features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water
his parents always allowed family members to come and stay
of the recently took a survey at the  agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination
censorship is really unavoidable and it should not be an issue
first of all if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them
not even books that will influence bad things
first reason is that you will need to use a computer in everyday life
when many heard about earthquake in  they could pull up information within seconds
there are many things that a computer can do which is really good
computers are a great help for projects email vacation spots and so on
now no one should be doubting the benefits of a computer
it could be happening with every letter you press
he even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration
censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people
in conclusion books should not be banned because it limits our individuality we have the freedom of press and because it destroys our future
there are many reasons for overpopulation
on top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable
just like any other industry libraries need people to use their multimedia materials such as books magazines music etc
in the end i got the game anyway
the author created a warm loving mood throughout the memoir
dear  i heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people
censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around
like if you have a that to like you can to online and you can talk to them
the setting of rough road ahead do not exceed the speed limit effects the cyclist in many was
offensive is only used in the first part but not in the second and the same material was used
for adults it could be information on starting a business
one way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water
there is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer and as far as advances in technology this is only the beginning
for instance last month i sprained my ankle and i stayed home from school for one day
it comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age
my neighbour’s twelve year old son is a cripple
he tells them short stories about the fruits
i was thrilled and excited as it was the first time that i was going to the forest
just because of a  many issues rise
the tent was decorated with colorful lights
then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people
many shows are based of a book series and that series not be a good one
the features of the setting affect the cyclists mood towards the journey
and the only i could talk to them outside of school was on a computer
with all the ways computers help us there is no reason why they would negatively affect us
he is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it
dear newspaper this is a very controversial topic
children and adults are spending too much time on the computer which causes to lose eye sight
i think you should put all you support in the problem
i think as long as its blocked off into a different room everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm
those of the various moods set by the author in this memoir
directions are very important
so far all of the towns have been deserted
which is kind of sad if you ask me
computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things
did you ever miss the newest episode of your favorite show
to this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate
this discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging
that childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money sex and abuse
for example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states with only luck id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat
did you know that over of kids and teens are obese computers can contribute to this statistic
this is many of the reasons some materials should be banned from kids
second when
you can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a agent
like i have stated before there should not be any censorship in libraries at all
certain materials such as books music movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves even if they are found offensive
some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite instead of taking the time to go outside
so computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication
if you go on the computer you can get all of these names and items for less than compared to 
the same goes for being told what you can and can not read
by starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands
so when it comes down to censorship in libraries or anywhere its just a bunch of opinions
computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the setting relates to how the author is feeling
why wait any longer
you can do things like learn socialize and actually become healthy
it makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it or that past generations have something to hide
also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings
lastly i would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer
also lets say your doing a project and you need information instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it
he should take a bath every day
in my opinion i believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves
the main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy
once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem
that would be a horrible experience for a young child to have
this saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade
for example scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch
those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist
some ways computers are good for you are that you can get a better education when you have websites with so much information
libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building
a computer help people build skills now and for their own future
my stepfather needs to get of the computer
there are many different versions of the but many different religions
dear local newspaper i agree that computers have an effect on people
that is why the author ends this story the way they did
in my science class a boy named never does his homework
it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid
no matter how much computer do they be but it is kids getting bigger and bigger all because they long
one time i went to the library and i was looking for a romantic book to read and i could not find it
another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy
three fourths kids under age go online more than adults age because the interest in what is on it
he hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned rundown factory
censorship can be good or bad it really depends on how you look at things
he begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he not complete the journey
the first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother the second only ten minutes and the last a mere five minutes
i think the mood of the is warm caring comforting and very loving
at times people do not close the taps properly
my first reason i mentioned before was it would give us intelligence
the music some one could listen is also very bad and your child could listen to that
to have independence you are the one in control
children however should be treated as a special case
also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together
that book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book
those  are over weight or obese
the last paragraph of the story
all of your hard work will be turned into ash but if it was on the computer you be able to retrieve it
after that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination
the final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library
he has no worries no hardships and no troubles
the setting of a story is the background place and time the story took place
in addition to all this some people can task and many things like hang out with there family and friend but most importantly enjoy life
the world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures and what better way than to talk to them
last sentence
the text says somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees
there have been those action packed movies where there is all the fighting and the blood and the punching
and that makes the world safer for every one
that he was thirsty and had holes
computers also allow people to talk to each other via the 
 he said
stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations
the mood of the memoir is happy and thankful
libraries are targeted toward every age group and censorship just allows everything to be appropriate for everyone
they told me about my mother living in 
when a kids starts to hate his or her work
not every person in this world has the same opinion
she has built the nest with twigs and leaves
the parents point of view makes things a lot worse
do not take thing off the shelve just because a couple of students can read or watch it
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting effect the cyclist
although certain materials are not meant for children to see adults find it enjoyable and interesting
so what do you do
his isolation while cycling down the shortcut was a definite factor in his strain
i think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library
people are so fat
could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children but are instead holding back our society as a whole
computers are fun education and a communication wonder
that is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library
she should be strong and follow the flow of life
if you saw a book on the shelf of your library that took offense to you in some way or another how would you react
all in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports
computers have helped children and adults learn increased the amount of jobs and helped law enforcement
the forerunner was moving at a tremendous speed
either way there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive
do you think scheduling helps
they are getting to checkout books movies and music for free unless it becomes over due
with the recent earthquakes in and 
if it is possible to have two moods then this memoir does
computers help people learn and make work easier its a fact
an example of music not being censored would be rap
i was born in a hotel kitchen
going off road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge
then why should that person be punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something
the animals are our best friends
that includes children
you can find year old on the internet now
authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them
he mentions the love that he had of cooking with his parents
but i know that even though i find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me another person will
computers are also great for talking online to family and friends
computers can do amazing things
luckily there is light at the end of this tunnel
a piece of music movie or magazine
but she failed setting if there on time
because there is an interminable amount of information i believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about
make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids
i would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right
to me i would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons
this shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others and how much others cared for them
censorship should be evident in all sections of the library
social skills play a very important role when you are finding a job for the first time
people can gain the effects of laziness little brain effort and lose interaction with the outside world
the author made the setting seem long and unbearable felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand
this is final reason why i was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer
no matter how hard you try if you are using a computer you will learn something
not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them
no material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship
i swim on a swim team for a 
party with friends and family
i love many different kinds of music  most of it is very fun to listen to
computers do have an effect on people
when i was taking fruit and enjoying dancing i suddenly woke up
i am lucky to have mr david as my next door neighbor
i know i would not just for my kids but for other children also
not to mention the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home
or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private
not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable
some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers
in the it stated that we have the freedom of press and speech
you can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping
its all in perspective
like me many kids have family across the ocean or just across the country either way contacting them is tough
this is why libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are in the eyes of some offensive materials
the above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist
when i was younger and i said that i was going to read a book i was really reading one
they might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read but some people are more visual with the movie
you can tell by the way she knew what her gift was
the abandoned grape juice factory is also a let down for the cyclists mental state
if there was shade a breeze and weather he would be fine but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer
music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do
also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online
my mother brought milk and biscuits for me
now a days people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys
remember though to not stay on too long
when you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house
we bought tickets and went in
also teachers use it to help them teach classes and prepare materials for it
magazines are nothing but gossip
movies is to popcorn as music is to headphones
student and employees use for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation
in many school libraries certain books music movies and magazines have been removed because of the content in them
i really do not get why you should complain about these things
this happens maybe close to of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online
they can see bad pictures nudity drugs and violence
because he really loves his mother and father and his baby sister
most times i will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie
any music store you walk into you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music
but they had faith that they would prosper
i will be telling you about how i think computers are great
that electricity comes from power plants
our animal instincts are brought under control
those movies are watched by people of all ages
you can watch all types of movies
with be answered
thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty
they give me great joy
she is not giving up on it
i would like for you to appreciate my concern on how society should have computers
this makes people happy and still keeps them informed about what their family members or friends are up to
it helps kids fit in
also can we please start using normal books instead of online ones
not allowing anyone under to check out explicit materials would also help
he is basically in a desert and he is running low on water
the author was serious to the point where his family had to go through economic and personal problems
he is well trained
it can also teach you about tons of other things
computers have even made our society
i believe that if books magazines movies etc
he aces the reports and continues to use this method
maybe you read books go to school or even watch 
just like parents for example
a large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called 
on you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians
it helps people to learn about others and information about them
of coures there are no modern amenities like transport hospitals school etc
the setting plays an important part in the authors mood
dear trained reader 
some people see computers as a way to rot your brain while others see it has a learning device
this cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature
the girl asked
not two miles into this section of the ride i noticed the terrain changing
i rely on my computer so much that i would be lost without it and i would get half as much done
instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music
second reason how the computer can teach people things
cursing to me is not offensive
the hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese 
they have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that
on the other hand i got to sit home and watch them have fun
did you know that of your life skills can and are learned on computers
some students play different games in the playground
no i do not
the plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said
but then are people who disagree with them
my second reason would be that computers are useful in studies
since the hospital was a private one the salaries were rather low
what ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete 
things got bad
nature is beautiful
the parents do nothing because they do not care about their own child
if your a busy parent with kids you can work online
but your cant get a new family
people should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library
these groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read watch or listen to
rapid industrialization urbanization and population growth have contributed to the loss of trees
moreover the children were bound to destroy these things in no time
plus you can print thing out on a computer with a book you have to copy important down
a girl climbed up the ladder without any support
rape is a horrible thing but it happens
librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read
some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child
for we are all the same but yet still broken up among looks and culture
statistics show that of all children who are permitted to talk with friends out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades
they do not want to lose there books music movies magazines just because some people find the offensive
the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful
if anything they help together
books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others
the media does not look at you as a whole just as a population of people
dear local newspaper you agree that computers effect people
the people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material
 his gratefulness
it also says like the geese
offensive literature sexual content disagreeable topics
on a light note they could just have an open mind so that the song or the book or the movie can still be sold
keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do
because it shortens activity time
also the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do
the dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt
furthermore computers are a way for students to study
he also talked about how the road was rough
my third reason give people the ability to learn about faraway place and people
get more copies of the book
will be the ones and all that important stuff
the mood created by the author in the memoir is being together
i believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice
my teacher said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by on computer and internet research projects
i can remember when my step mom was a size six in the waist
to whom this concern computers are a great source of technology but many people spend to much time on them
when an author writes a story or an article they are putting their opinion into it
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
if we need to know about slaves or slavery we can go to our library
some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive
you can sense throughout the whole story that he is completely grateful to his parents for the love they gave him and their home life
dear of  you know that eight out of ten homes in have at least one computer if not more
is an overall mediocre idea with some exceptions
words do not exist that can describe how amazing those parents are to do what they did
some people should think that school should not read due to racism in the south
a study made by students at shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are dropped almost in people that use computers often
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
this way there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager
what be offensive to one person not be to another
computers maybe useful but they are over used
music is for the most part like a book just using a different one of your senses
the author shows a willingness to try harder in this story
it was not too hot yet in the morning
this will effect our youth because we will be fat unhealthy and sluggish all the time
this is why i think computers have a positive effect on people
 computers are very helpful devices
he also says hes never listening to old men and hell always use the map
he or she is not forced to buy read or watch what is offending them
music is something that everyone listens to no matter is its rap country or the blues
the own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much which bring me to the next point
over vast changes of terrain
most younger kids these days are starting to listen to the fast rap music
computers are the center of technology
less time to do their homework so they just begin to not do any of it
if you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature
to a doctor at 
if music and movies were at libraries their would be no need for books and people would stop buying books
there are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask  were they thinking when they made that
computers is a positive affect for our country because it helps us find information for school and for location were to go
you can learn about or you name it you can type it in google and you can learn everything about that country
everyone in our neighborhood was out and trying to help put off the fire with water and sand
is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet
everyone is different
i think computers have become part of our daily life
while on the computer the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise
that is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer
lastly i think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors
any one can use them and learn new things at the same time
i had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings
dear  you know that of spend to much time on their computers
the first reason why computers are bad because cause addition to your child
the computer can be used in many ways
the internet allows research to happen
so fight for the right to stop the addiction internet use and live a great life
you are with your family but they are not your blood family
this provides us of offensive material back in the old days
in conclusion throwing books out and keeping a library censored would be a mistake
it will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers
first the memoir creates a happy mood
many people been buying them at or 
at electronic stores computer games are sold
as you can see there reasons why i am concerned about people spending time on the computer
last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them
all the precious articles in the almirahs were also safe
as well as do other things as well as the same time
if reading materials were taken away that are found offensive our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well
i do not agree that computers benefits society
now but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it then our freedom is taken away
considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult
some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life
but everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know
likewise to help our reflexes computers with the would help people that are distance apart could connect
spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do but with computers people to not do that much anymore
he talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen
i thought the world would be a better place without me
different people have different hobbies
we as citizens have the right to make our own choices and our choices should be limited by the views of certain individuals
again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear
should be remove unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books
also kids in school use computers all the time for school work and to learn about new things
so to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject
money be the most vital thing in our society right now
these are ways how computers do benefit our society
if a library has educational music why not keep them in there
spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people
but the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now
the driver came out of the bus
i know that libraries were created to be information
gives the parent control of what their child sees instead of the child having full control
lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions
who bans the books
perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time
furthermore computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch
the author says that his parents helped him discover the real meaning of family
instead of mailing a letter you are electronically sending it
many people in different cultures find many different things offensive
he went in drank cool water and then on used his own map rather than old guys
this one band got banned in the united states of for there music
what might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another
well i have good reasons as to why computers are good technology
people would like to learn about different things
when someone spends months or even years on writing a story they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long hard work
you can watch movies on your computer and download fun games
it even gave websites on the back of the book
another way that computer provide entertainment is they let us listen to music
another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries
the mood was also very calm and very relaxing for the story
this is because i do not think children know as much as we do so it will give them wrong ideas they have taken the wrong way
the story with this paragraph symbolizing a new beginning about to take place
there once was a young girl fourteen or fifteen who loved to read and listen to music
my opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes
one of the first things is our freedom of speech
sure you can video chat but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a persons words
so learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time
its quick easy and it works
it gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too
computer affect us in a negative way that can change the course of our life
he is also very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice
i also think that many people have been complaining about the violence in the community due to several disturbing books music and so on
i would think that computers give a positive effect on people
another thing it can do is play video games
the technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast easy enjoyable way
this is a reason i wish censorship was in our local libraries
dear of the local newspaper students are promoted to higher grade levels more teachers will require research papers
also if a person finds that information they were most likely looking for it
and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day this is an example of how he lost courage
do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears
the first thing you could do is learn
they are going to miss out of nature or hanging out with friends
we can easily look up facts about anything on the computer
even though i explained a lot of reasons why computers are a great thing to have there are still a ton more
how would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone kept hearing bad words from a song that was in the library
here let me help mother
d you know that there is more than radio station
but if your computer it gives lots of you can find information
they can even monitor what your typing which could be passwords
for example in a cool day riding gently downhill the rider is happy and energetic
students should spend more time with their families they should exercise more and lastly focus more on their grades in school
i would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people
because this program we are able to stay in touch
some people use their computers for business of work related
there can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation
this should be a high priced reason for agreement
even though his parents had no knowledge of the language or culture they immigrated to make a better life for their children
i found all i needed to know about him getting me that rocking at on my project
they can be done only by the help of a computer
censorship in school libraries is important but at the same time it is not necessary
this shows despite what happened he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude
public views are starting to take over the world
i remember one morning when i was rushing before school i had no idea what type of outfit to wear
because of site like these
there was no one around that he could ask for help from
people are different and they will thank different things
out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people
this will cause the to melt and then the sea will rise
missed each other until i turned and was invented
who would decide what is offensive and not offensive
over all there will be  cursing and smut novels out there
he stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear
i personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit then being inside on the computer getting fat
just by using a computer you could easily go online search friends you want to to better and chat with them
as he is riding he comes across some hills
how would you like it if someone took a book away from you just because it had language or nasty meaning
we have read about many conquerors like alexander the great julius caesar nepolean etc
hence it is essential to bring an awareness of computers among the common people
whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is you game a computer will suit you
every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact
for example the other day i logged onto the internet and saw an article about the earthquake in 
also make sure you eat well food provides a lot of energy
without the computer many people would not be able to explore these places and learn about them
they can go onto and type in any question they want to be answered
it teaches better than books
these are probably the is for school
i this setting he used up his water and it was hot
it also lets you communicate with your family friends or other people you need to communicate with
i feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that a other person would not understand
she is stressed about failing the drivers test country but it is and she realizes that nothing is the same
one last example was that he was lost
if the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain
they are nit interested in going to the library in order to research information on people places and family heritage
while people can learn about faraway places from the safety of their houses can also the computer for communication purposes
you can also email
 that is not the case here 
and they will always try to fight and say that artist like    and are not suited for their 
somebody on that day in a room with their eyes to the computer screen
parents can censor what their kids read if they want
they also showed him the meaning of family
i would most certainly not
for example one day my mom and dad got into a series of arguments
take about minutes to an hour of your day talk to those people you never get to see do your reach
the child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better
take of for example
stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out
computers benefit us by easy aces to info
censoring is not going to change our society
this is a serious concern to our health
same with many other people
mom
the hot weather was another factor that affected the author trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state
what are you going to do with it
many people world complain about it
yes people do spend that time in computers a lot its because computers are very helpful in many ways
yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to or visit in person
thirdly they are a great source of entertainment
it seemed as though he never left
the lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize
in my opinion computers are handy but dangerous
less cyberspace bullying and less burning of electricity
for example many books talk about drugs and smoking
also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment
these kind of things affect our every day living
when i was ten years old my family and i went on vacation to 
finally going out doing sports and starting fit is very important
one way is the setting
you can go in the computer in and the you see the pieces of your car
every book movie  magazine and any other thing should be left for people to enjoy and hopefully you can find something you enjoy too
also if a student has a paper due the  but their printer is broken they email the paper to the teacher
i know that people need to use the things such as email projects ideas or even models but really does anybody read a book anymore
you think that it has been checked out but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive
you can even talking online with your friends on computer
each site having at least different games
even family and friends suffer when computers are around
these are all the reasons why computers are bad
there are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills
when i was young i visited my cousin 
its a quicker and new way to meet new people
if a student is nervous he can not learn anything
i do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves
this would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem
you can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want
computers are a waste of money
it is pretty clear to me things need to change
 it is a way to connect with faraway friends
to me music is something more to express your feelings
was very into reading
there are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries
so she could possibly pass out without brake and the hot temperatures
as you read my letter i hope you fell the same way
well his mission was accomplished
also the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid
this shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring
honestly i totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the  because of many reasons
they re informational
instead of making a habit of going online everyday why not make a habit like try to get all your homework done each night
so as i conclude my letter to you the north courier i shall restate that i do support technology because they do have positive effects on people
however that does not mean there should not be any limitations
anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays
the features of the setting affected the cyclist
the sad thing is i did not know it before i did it
so in strong opinion it is a good idea to have a computer
now here comes the negative effect
this benefits people in a positive way
we want to know the welfare of the person
it was a simple house they started turned to a warmth home
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
i by exercise in to go and play with friends or bike or go for a jog
now they see each other almost every week
i started laughing helplessly at myself
so she is not being pressured into taking it
the next reason is that it could cause rate of the materials to go down
a day where there are no books in the school library
how could they
ducks were swimming in the ponds
parents now than ever are concerned about how their children are raised and are always looking to clear inappropriate things away from their lives
without all the books that are in our libraries would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science history and electronics
how can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books or books with rude language and scandalous themes
when my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on and ended up calling him minutes later
now most to all should know that there are children sections in most if not all libraries
so she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed
besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short rolling hills
you can use a computer to look up what ever you want to look for example the teacher ask to look up a giraffe
is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events
so i can see what too much computer time can do
he is tall and healthy
everyone could express themselves everyday in their own way
with these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games
of course it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please
you can learn a lot from computers
this would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual
they basically had to start over this pursuit to get good careers
it was dry lifeless and hot the sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water but he was running out
traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him
are turning people against each other
how would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends
or if you want to learn about a certain far away place why not visit the place instead
if libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children then there should be no censorship in libraries
the mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love
so just let us choose if we would like to read material with uncensored things in it
not for me but for you
i feel like censorship is wrong
the snow is melting represents change from cold to warm
of course not all users have a computer for information
i hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view
what one parent feels is very offensive another feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn
so as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people ways that they do this is that they are educational  they help learn
each feature causing the cyclist to act
in my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays
secondly the computer creates false personas
another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people
while others argue that they are very helpful
the terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on
second remind her of her home
do you are one
i believe the mood is one of gratitude gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well
this would create a corrupt society with a lot of fighting
kids should be able to read what they want to read
com and find it in a split second
before the computer a student had to use a type writer to type their papers
a doctor is an important person
imagine not eating sleeping and walking around for a day
instead moved from one area to a different area
instead you can look up the facts you need online
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
they could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers
there are springs of water in few places in a desert
those were the opinions i had on computers
if more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue
or listen to
sometimes you need the computer to do your homework
the materials children see and hear is up to parents
it is one thing to chat online but it is better to be able to see someone face to face than a picture on screen
children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all
another reason why books should not be removed is people are taught when to tell that something is offensive
he had found a water pump
this a important skill because it helps with physical movements using your hands for example
should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the selves
there were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes
you learn so many good things from a libraries
just look around you they show it in movies they talk about it in books
even if you and call some one they not be home or answer
in a recent poll done by magazine it stated that of people between the ages of and prefer to be online rather than outside exercising
we would have less conflict less deaths and better lives that are enriched not corrupted  with quality media
if he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case
she can feed him which she ca do online
in the memoir the author creates lots of moods
she will try the driving test again and the plant will overcome
that changed me big time i felt really had for those people
when children read they learn many new words that are in that book
i think computers are good because you can talk to your friends and family on the computers
this is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place
at the end he thanks his parents for everything
its a fact that you instead other people on computers
in conclusion i remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when sick so that could cheer me up
or how would we ever get any reports done for work or home work
censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem
they came to for him to have a better life
and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run
five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book she read and enunciated every word in the book
it could end up in a huge problem not only for the children and their parents but also for the school
but i still know that people like them so i would not take them away
he went through three towns that had nothing
do you love technology
lastly computers make life easier
the heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke
if you are doing a history project and you need more information and pictures log onto a computer and it
computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age
she answered yes
he says in the story the speed limit was 
i think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days
plus computers are great for research
young children can be very loud and energetic
even if your just looking to talk to someone you can easily do that on the internet
kids spend too much time on computers
of all people in the have computers
he had immense patience and strove for perfection in everything
everyone has an opinion and watching out for your children is understandable
therefore the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment
without computers we would be like the  offense any people
the reason i would describe the mood as soft and compassionate is
my opinion is that any type of material no matter what it contains should be able to be found on a library shelf
perhaps a restricted section would be in order if the problem would involve corruption of innocent minds but a full censor would never be necessary
overall computers serve many helpful purposes for people
the world in full of offensive material and there almost nothing we can do for it
the land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder
they miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the  or going out and playing in the snow and making  forts or having a fight
a book would probably take up more time and you get less information
people can write letters to each other but that can be time consuming and show to delivery and response
thank you for accepting my 
the choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child
the cyclist a had rough time
have you ever wanted to see what looks like
the computer is like a cause and effect
dear  computers are all around us where ever you go
there is a reason why there is so many different genres
as teen who attends school i know that i would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer
he also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback which he avoided even though it almost covered the road
a nice sunny day sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books
you can explore any place you want with the click of a button
everybody has their own opinion on things that is what makes us human individuals
most of the time these words are said when i am angry at myself or another person
every human in the is entitled to their own choice of religion
this tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road
another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier
the cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight
by typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat
in my opinion yes
all of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed
nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing
book censorship is a big deal in the world today
the mood created in this memoir is happy and warm
but she had herself much preferred it to a big mac
had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics
many friendships are formed among people who have common hobbies
second we need computers to do research for school and work
also talks about how lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world
you will be doing a lot of damage to a lot of people
at least when you research using a book or encyclopedia you can trust those sources
computers have internet websites and search like  that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the information and pictures or that subject
why is that good well my point of view is that business need that to order their stocks for store carriers and more
to choose what they want to read or watch
the point is anything can be found offensive if you just glance at it or look at it to much
computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
the rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land
we have the right to take down the books but why should we
computers are used for getting messages to different people in the
is it all around or do children go and find it
you can learn trillions of things on the internet
it varies from kids fiction and nonfiction
if not their parents then the media right
the word itself is a symbolism of slavery without it the book is not as powerful
with these in place there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public
the growing mind and body needs to move and exercise
when you are walking around you you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked
to add one final thing would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word
i think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me
if you are going to read a book do not get a book that is offensive
poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally
because everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not
the stones he found on the ground helped keep his mind off the thirst
by spending time with family you not only learn more about them but you can become closer and be able to talk with them about anything
in my opinion i it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places
my personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended
you should agree
i rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face
go on the computer the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions
also it depends on what what the ages the kids are or adults
so lets start to cut our usage time down now
to finish this letter i want to say that  computers allow people to learn 
no one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology
in the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past while the spring represents a more optimistic future and a new beginning
i believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a stronger positive one
i think that it is important that know a meteor is about to strike the world no
computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world a way to increase responsibility and helpful for education
during peak hours there is a huge rush at the bus stops
that changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills
next the hills and roads over one long crippling hill
the warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue
so think before yo act
the youth of is portrayed in mostly a negative light
through these our settings the effects change
what do they do
it tones up the whole system
i am a science student but unlike my other classmates i have opted for elective english
computers take away peoples free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness
so the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first town as he calls it in the essay
lastly video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person
she misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home
i got first prize in my school for the drawing competition
well the internet is a great way to do this
so i realized that i can go on the computer at the library
the mood created by the author was grateful and happy
computers are a good thing to have because you can learn information
excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise
the features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot
the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways
i can imagine that my grades would be i did have access to the internet of at home
setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist depending on if its smooth or rocky or hot or cool
whats makes a computer any better than life
but at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
think about how life would be in the without computers
this is a book giving the kids to see how things were
he only recounts good things and happy memories in the entire memoir
they had many friends and were thankful
with entertainment it is hard to please everyone
so then you play more and get addicted
the physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position
the terrain and hills made it difficult
to who this concern in my opinion computers have greatly improved our lives
i believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that be far away
the people that they will donate some money to the poor
first up books in the library
they either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library
putting books on public shelves for the public to read can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions
then when done you can print it or even send it straight to your teacher
aunt rosi gave it to me as a present
music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people
i had studied the whole day
another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race everyone got along and help others out
the mood that takes place in this article would be sorrow excitement and being grateful for the parents he had
in addition computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people
i chuckled checked my water supply and moved on
all in all we cannot get extinguish the flames of our past or we never have a future
saying such if someone finds a book offensive they just should not pick it up
also you can learn about new places if you ever want to move to another country
i know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it
have you ever wanted to go on vacation to somewhere overseas
then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope
a horror film is not suitable for a of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on 
finally the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist
there are so many uses
having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get
the sun was beginning to beat down but i barely noticed it
then they end hurting themselves
being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world unable to enjoy the beauty of or send help to the starving people in 
however she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back
this is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does
with a phone you can only chat with each other but a computer has a webcam
movies show us the ups and downs of life
among others i find that if you censor one thing you censor them all
if you had a video on the news you want to keep it
i found that horrible
for most of my childhood i did this and it was very simple
in my opinion i say no to this question
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
another feature was the road sign that said do not exceed posted speed limit the speed limit was 
it moves at the speed depending on the force it is paddled with
if anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in
i for one do not
this means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it
it should be the parent choice to what their child can look at or listen to
knowing there is a creature like that there is bound to be more
when they are sad mad upset confused etc
so no i believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem
most libraries are open to the public
he thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean
children are going to end up hearing bad words seeing inappropriate things and reading offensive passages in books or magazines
this technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything
social networks such as and allow that
i love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup hot chocolate
i would enjoy my hobbies and complete some urgent duties also
i have not found one thing in our library offensive to me
over the year the flower goes through phases dying then rebirth
everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf
this form of bulling has happened to many and we have lost many to it
i think that there is different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required
it will also help us see new places because we can goon the internet
would you like to set your children up to fail
you can make computers program them fix them and even supervise them doing work
people are not always as they say they are
lets get onto first point being social
no one person has the right to remove a book from the shelves that they feel is offensive let alone ban it entirely
i think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some stuff in it that little kids could look at or watch
to this i disagree
also there is the television
most everyone has used uses or will use a library in their life
he is not a rich man
in our school we are taught about the risks of computers and how to prevent any possible 
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm
some information should be only seen by adults
for my second opinion that people should not get off of computers because it they ever leave somewhere far they are not to be able to contact you
she hopes she is right about the flowers maybe she likes the spring
the scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert
but is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are
every one in the world is not all going to like all of the same movies books and music we all have different testes
the world has changed and books should too
that way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive
censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society
it is something to do when you are sitting at home and also when you are in the classroom
but guess what they are in the computer wasting time instead of spending time with your family
the only thing we should be worried about is the rated movies
because of the internet people no longer need to get together and talk turn on their computers which is a waste of energy
therefore i believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone we would not have a media
and giving details on showing people reading this article is that technology of computers also help save
and some people do find that person that they been looking for
some were reading newspapers
kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention
they also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often
begging brings a bad name to the society and country
also of adults staying is good
i say that there is some material for adults teens and children
movies should be restricted from children to watch them
third say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork
it is necessary to solve the problem of overpopulation
music is also a controversial material to censor
therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech
in my opinion computers are good for many reasons
and sometimes that can get a little pricey especially since you can get free at a library
in  we have freedom of speech the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose
though these are all valid opinions they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves
however the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people
people and politicians try to cash on the sufferings of people
make go in the woods and wake around
who is to say what is or is not offensive
so by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it will reduce problems before they even happen
it took him about an hour he typed papers
a huge purpose of computers is to keep in touch
she had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it then she could too
another topic in the is the freedom of choice
his destination on a dry day
i think that learning how to type is an excellent thing
no matter where people go they can find something that could offend someone
she felt hopeless miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland
secondly computers can bad for your health at a the eyes and people with trouble seeing
so got lost help
next i believe that computers benefit society because keeps people organized
people do not find the same things offensive so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue
instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice sunny joy go for a walk in the woods
owning a computer is surely not a good idea
so the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope
in my opinion everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read watch or even listen to
the rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle
she will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also
in present day most people live on the computer
programs like allow to present their work in a new and efficient way
as a result people would still get to enjoy nature
people could be in a dark room all day isolated from everyone they came about just because they are on the computer
many of times right that can be accidental or on purpose
also it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake
a century ago talking to people instantly seemed just about impossible
he knew he should have taken the right way instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous
for example you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off
censorship in the libraries
water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water
the computer is all about fun you have millions of websites you can go on
it was a beautiful place
some college students have to look up their assignments and how to do them on their professors web page
without computers we would probably be really bored for the rest of our lives
she had been very discouraged by this and she was trying to remind herself of being at home
this means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming
also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy
sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people
if you do not like people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you then you are not going to watch 
i do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries
at times computers could distract you
have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it
no the reason i say that is because if it was offensive to methey might not be offensive to other people
most to all times the takes from the genre
we need computers
all you need to do is print out the pictures
losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource
people depend on computers too much it can backfire and cause a problem for you
people should learn how to deal with different struggles in life
also he says summertime rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain
but most importantly you can learn so much
experts even say how computers change the way they act at home and in the public
but libraries today has be way more improved and advance with musicmoviesand etc
they can stick through it together
some schools know a day almost depend on computers
when the flower is budding it is beginning a new life
to break the impasse i exchanged the note
father took immediate action
the kids chose to read the book in the first place so it would be their own doing if their life changed
the if you missed it
they help organize your thoughts which stress
for example fights could break out or wars could even start depending on how many people were offended
therefore computers have positive effects
while maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like there not beautiful or self worthy as the women in the magazine
it would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive because almost everyone is offended by something
well computers can be a good or a bad thing
another is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type
certain thinks should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion
it provides information on vacations hotels ext
they are always full of people
i have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but if i did then i would not say anything
first family friends can communicate from a far distance
both bright and weak students fear examinations
people are now these days
the mood created by the author was one of happiness love and caring
remain on the shelf
we should try to keep the friends we have
this is why communication having a positive affect on people is the most important reason
he was wet and i gave him a towel to wipe himself
i can tell he is very proud of his parents because they gave up everything to come to so their children could have better lives
i love to play hockey
there is many benefits to owning a computer
this right should never be taken away from us
with having a computer people will be able to talk to their family that live in other states then them
the cyclist settings hinder him in the essay rough road ahead
computers are a relatively new invention they have become very popular
from this we can affirm that not only was at hot the water was dirty
the features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located
the only thing that i believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos
sometimes teachers give assignments out and you have to write an essay
it should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can
books songs magazines and movies all have purposes as to why they were created
from what i seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content
the effects computers have on people are only negative
they say that the cons outweigh the pros
the strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect
secondly not a lot of people will go to the library to look up information for a paper for a school
they can also help people get a better education
taking the media from its citizens such as books movies and music is unconstitutional
they all brought gifts for me
on a computer you can do many things to never get bored
this would be bad for all children
this can not be true
if we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place
the amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house
now think if it how many do you see your kid on it
if there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it
you could always because it is always better to make new friends
meat and fish
so when she finally got home to her mother she showed the flower to her
if it was not helpful they would have never put it in the library from the start
those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once is sold in stores
there are some good ones out there if u look
that affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling
you think that it is okay to let your child watch a movie rated  but little did you know there is nudity in it
 which let me explain is 
more often a market place is found in the town
do computers make harm
it gives us joy in our spare time
it would be like having someone take out a word in the 
that is why she says she will pass the test when the hibiscus buds bloom
the story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him
it approaches the prey stealthily
the rough road made it harder for him to pedal therefore he was working harder and getting thirsty
it can be found offensive at time
they benefit mankind by forming alluvial soil but they also cause tremendous havoc to human life and property
you can even simply use it to help with homework essays
we are allowed to give our opinions on any topic and describe it in any way
so the mood created in the excerpt is loving and caring
it is very caring of them because when they moved to not only did they look after their baby but other people that needed help as well
the plant becomes a comporting item that reminds her of her homeland
if you find something offensive just leave alone
that means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her
is a online service that you use to talk to them in person
this means the faster easy to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain
try not to get involved with any online games being in a nationwide disease
honestly careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves
that is why i think the memoir gives off loving and caring mood to the readers
i think that these are all very important
this is a big issue especially if you have a webcam
instead they are inside on their computers
sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer
if we started removing books movies etc
it shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test
they have to be used in moderation though because exercise and staying healthy is good
is it worth it to use all that time
magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world
that number has risen to out of  as of 
if you need to find out where something is you can always count on the internet
some of it should be left up to the school or library but it is also a responsibility of the parents
computers can send out information and they are risky
overall censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it worth
has no one ever heard of freedom of speech
the use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are
that shows that the geese were kind of like her they were moving to a different place to start a new
she ventures to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences
he is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it
the mood is well many different things
just imagine watching and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it
or new shows and music all be find
in public if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble
then they split up for good
computers are also a part of my everyday life because i have to use it to do research for school or typing up an paper
books music movies and magazines be offensive to someone but not everyone
in this memoir the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories
book fairs are organized in all important countries to make the public aware of the new frontiers of knowledge
have you become a better person for doing so
movies that are bad should be taken off the shelf
it would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading
it is east to communicate using a computer
students can devote time to their favorite pursuits
now is the time to take action but making more clubs or activities to people
so when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted there will always be another person to say the exact opposite
all other cars could be seen running far behind
because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life
this is what i think should happen to books in a library
people should not be shielded from the real aspects of life
everyone has a different taste just like in music
people get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months
however when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar she is determined to adopt as well
it helps you play better in sports like baseball and not only that but it helps future jobs
i truly feel bad for that person then again it could be fixed
it is always nice to greet a father a mother or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown
as the cyclist continues on his ride changes begin to occur in the surroundings which ultimately affects the cyclists attitude
not only this you family
you no if books have all the information you need for school project or your own family history
if we censor the books in our libraries then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture
sohan lal is about twentysix years old
now is the time to agree
if some find it offensive then no one can read it how is that fair to the people who do enjoy it
they not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have
when that is not true do to the fact that computers have
think about it
another example is racial jokes some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive
computers help us learn a lot about just about everything
so far there has not been much progress in the lists so i would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article
books mean a lot to people that love to read
in the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick
some students sit in their classrooms
people today rely on being able to speak their minds to be apart of their government
parents kids should simply not read these books
for the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre
they you might be out of luck for what you are looking for
you can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers
it can and will mentally scar them for life
others teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best
throughout this memoir there was moods of caring loving grateful  happiness
in conclusion having a family computer is a very good thing
the heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride
just because some people take offense to certain things does not mean that everyone does
this websites help take your mind off a bad day
censoring books could take away from learning
another way of communication is through email
you can also find the nearest hospital
people need darkness to rest
that is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away friends friends of friends etc
instead of eating dinner at the computer go out to dinner as a family
removing the material might frustrate and offend the author or other readers
this is what the tone of this memoir is
i love going on the computer time to time doing many things i have talked about
the library has a section for children only
he can’t
in this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving
there are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas at times people will disagree
he takes care of them and they take care of him
by sticking to this method offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them
they go to school for hours then go to basketball or football practice sometimes we just need a break
i am going to tell you how they are wrong
he knew that the move would have to be a big sacrifice for his parents to do so he thanks them often
they have the same right to have those books movies and magazines on the shelves as you do
after that the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them
there are three reasons why i do not agree
it leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about
there i could get the leftovers to eat
but instead they came to and struggled at first but the end result was more they could have imagined
so in conclusion computers are a source of health issues action issues and mental issues
people get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars
in conclusion computers should be advanced
some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it
a study has shown that of shy kids have increased the talkative skills in school
in this case it was leaving friends family and work behind and moving to a totally different country
i think all people should not have a computer
by using the computer people are not getting many benefits
in conclusion computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives
like sex drugs drinking bad language
these books were penned to educate our civilization
for example my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work
online interaction is not like just talking to someone in person or on the phone
but why waste enemy going to travel agency when in the internet instead say travel agent 
it is very bold
not many succeed with this goal which brings up another negative effect to the body
i think that more kids should start interesting with family and friend more often
in the exact same way censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love
it is actually a very simple matter
also the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away
the story also talks about a snake in the road
if we do not accept other people beliefs we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor
these online games are good ways to sire you the opportunity to do something you wont normally do
we get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens
i remember year i was doing a report about the 
i can only hope that if i ever become a cyclist i never have to endure this kind of situation
he started out with a smile on the face
i hope that this letter had convinced you of the benefits of computers
censorship in the  what is offensive to some not be to others
she then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant
all great men of the world were very hardworking persons
someone else might like it
if you think about all jobs that are happening today also of the computer
he would have had all of the grape juice he wanted but it was abandoned
you censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book
i love the big aircraft t the airport
also says that of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio
the mood created by the author in the memoir is pride
sometimes life can be so cool
not legible
everyone is different no one is the same
like i said we can make a certain section for them type of things
book is set in the during the time of slavery
at their young age exercise is very important
people chat on    and email and people are bullied
this makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved
the freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people
the author is a 
people will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want
to do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn
i can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time but so would a book
people us technology for they jobs like people that work for cars they need computers to see if the cars if old
a certain area designated for certain genres
happiness is a mood that the author tells you about
he is welcome everywhere because he brings letters from friends and relatives
in conclusion people should not be on computer too much because of their health and their privacy and also to be sure not to meet strange people
which everything includes the good and the bad
this passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence
materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about
if the others had an computer they would change there mind
many have it for entertainment purposes
if we try to remove every single book movie song or magazine that contain an offensive thing we would have to remove almost everything
here is my conclusion
computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody
the hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change
the amazing things a computer could do
people should be made to realise their social and political responsibilities
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride
also simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people
i remember when i had a cut on my arm that looked weird my mom was to heal a wound
we need and because of the realize ever a screen
in winter the plant is dormant  less colorful but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through about color in its buds
in fact one out of fifty books contain racism

time parents told me we were going to for the day

the features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist
but there are some who wait patiently
i reach school at eight in the morning and attend my classes
so should books in a library be censored
first off they should be removed because some people be offended by them
then you want to work or go to another school some you need to do it by computer
the knowledge of offensive things should not be taken away from people by the libraries
first of all how do we define offensive
whether it is writing a resume a science report or a spreadsheet none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand
once again i do believe computers can have a positive effect on people
you can even learn new recipes
you can also learn about different people and places
bookfairs bring the authors and readers close to each other
also the fact that computers just keep upgrading as time goes by
one way that he expressed this in the memoir was by saying that his man had let in other immigrants to their house
my brother envied me
also most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly
for example they can see pictures of men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example
it for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things if at any time
this might not even work but its worth a try
this is ridiculous
it should be colorful and playful as possible
my reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones
when students go on the computer they can chat with friends
that is history in this world and they should know it
the second people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people
these will even be areas on the website to donate to the that need assistance
the computer has anything for anyone
nowadays with all the great advances in technology peoples are always glued to computer screens
for example did you know that on average an adult will make more if they know how to type good and fast
people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist
the only thing i hope is that i got my point across to you
computers are fine in moderation as are most things
i hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration
the question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good
if people are always playing games the computers then when they go out for a jag
look for more and just let it let
staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy
dear reader has had a dramatic effect on human life
there were not many structures on the way
but then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers
the library should give the child a certain amount of time to return the book
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride
the flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus are obviously painful and part of her everyday life
mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do
about half of the people are talking to friends who live in another state
this story also gave a warm feeling by the story of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven
you can play all the music you want
everyone should not live offended by anything or anyone
also having this access to friends can help when one moves away
countless people around the world face these problems everyday and computer usage should be lessened
you know that you want to
therefore he should prepare notes regularly at home
your stressed and on edge you have just hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay
so i think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things mite change
people need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them
bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children
if you spend hours a day on a computer your eyes can get permanently damaged
dear local newspaper you ever see a child on the computer for hours and nothing could get them off
if they write literature
as you can see there are more cons than pros when it comes to computers
now picture this kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers when typing it would have taken three
of at states that the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors
this is a very interesting question
dear local newspaper computers
i also use the computer often
seeing this just crushes his spirit
as you can see a computer is so helpful and is a great resource
i need to be a doctor who kind to his patients
i believe all books would be fine left on shelves
in the novel to a  the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive
for example lets say that your doing a report on 
without computers life would be harder and boring
libraries need to take control of this issue the right way
people find ways to make themselves promises  to remind them of their old home
as the author continues you cannot help developing a sense of security
stuff like that i can understand because that can be personal reasons
but he was in the desert no one around hot dry no water and no shade
of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college
the mood created in this memoir is comfort
i was so happy because it was no cost to me
so i logged into my laptop and went on google within seconds the definitions wore popping onto my screen like pop rocks
aside from that computers make life easier
this can improve our travel
everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs
another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills and then comes across a rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit sign
in a recent study the amount of families with computers is now out of compared to the out of in 
a novel by   was banned
unlike the winter hibiscus it took a while for the geese to become through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now
everyone in this world is different and we all like different things
stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances
the cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map
they also have the right to not read the book at all
and by doing this it will help me on my project or essay
dear local newspaper you know people are starting to buy and own computers
there are no bad reason that could top any of these
bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the because people are not interested in nature anymore
dear readers i right to you today about the effects of computer usage
a child can simply go to another library or even a store to find the same thing
lastly computers are taking away family time
such as current events the history of our nation and how our government works
scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place
there are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful
like people use to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim
all of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored
if we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included
its now or never
the less time your child spends on the the less chance will have being kidnapped the is so dangerous would you ever put your child in danger
the features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story
amazingly computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way
now it would be a different story if we never had music movies and all that other good stuff
dear  i was growing up in my small little neighborhood life could not have been more simple
libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library
not kids have ways to find out what their going to be in live
i could neither watch tv and enjoy nor study
every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting
but magazines are different they show like the styles and life stories of others
on the full moon day my father hired a boat for two hours
please read the following reasons
so in my opinion the library should be a good use to everyone and leave the books magazines etc
the sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers rather than enjoying the day
many people love different types of books no matter if they are offensive or not others like them
i also hope they people make the right vote
do you agree with me that computers can help people
so do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
computers have a very good effect on people
other than winding you down on a rough day at work on the computer allow you to communicate with friends and family
they are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh
is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source
this one problem ran also affect you so many other ways
everyone has their own favorite book or genre
in a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most
we visit friends and relatives and exchange gifts with each other
when really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious
it really looked like a diamond back that is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to ease post it because of his lack of water
do you like your computer
we should not disturb others
people would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see
people can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before
that is where the computer can help
this all happened because she was addicted to a website
yes most people visit libraries for the wrong reasons but to other people those wrong reasons be the reason for them to gain more information
sometimes life can feel so cruel
some people would agree that some online games are educational
computers have technical problems that delete files
no matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication
books should be censored at all
chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly but they can also be dangerous
this includes pictures blogs comments and
also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees
this could be in more ways than one
so then were left with nothing
not every family can work well with everyone else
removing items from shelves removes history
for example one family view their children using curse words as offensive while another see no problem
the sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief
if libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read listen and watch what they wanted
what will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned
most magazines that are being sold today is giving children the wrong idea
a book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life
people use it sometimes for entertainment not research
the dessert is very hot
yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence
imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire right in the open
and do nothing except the computer
i believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries
phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets
without computers things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them
a yes or a no
i think libraries should only have family oriented movies
people use it for research or something in the future
people can learn new words they never knew about
going on the computer can have a negative effect on you
some people should just know better and take it 
therefore the market place is an important centre in the town
it does not seem fair to me
therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves
before checking the material out skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child
get off that computer it is 
another way computers have a bad effect on students is because of the internet
items like these are meant for adults only
do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way
when a child sits at the computer all day they are not getting exercise
when he showed his love for his home and culture his parents had shown him made the feel uplifting
the features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings
they would not make it in the world of today
as you can see it would help kids with whatever they are studying
however the issue will go on because after all we are all different and have our own opinions
in conclusion the mood of the memoir is very clear
when you get exercise you can lose weight
well now many things can be ordered offline
now what about your social life computers can be a helpful resource in many ways but not if you let them become a destruction
any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please
said the book explained what guys wanted
well i am sort of considered that smart kid
so if you do not want to see or your kids to see the offensive books and movies you should make sure not to go in the adult section
the music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment
thoughts of i feel as though offensive literary pieces should be able to be taken from libraries
which leading to death or jail 
in the adult section they have adult books
also the heat is killing him
shopping online creates a positive less hectic life for many people around the world
the computer can bring most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done
he also describes happiness in the kitchen the heart of the house
what would you do
about their book
everyone is obligated to their own choices whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive is their choice
the average bill per month is 
i should probably start rapping things up
my first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people
libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside
a computers makes it and it through a lack of information to just computer and find it faster
they get easy money by begging
just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book movie or music that is not there age group
when the hibiscus is ready to bloom she will be ready to drive
in conclusion i think that this could go both ways
a recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a page essay on what they had learned
in many libraries i know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children teenagers and adults
the best years of one’s life are the childhood days
i ask why some individuals would want to give one freedom we do have away
first of all children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes
you can discuss things like weather ideas you have you can even plan exercise days
after a week of this game
now computers are very popular
you can find great low prices on travel agencies on the computer
features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story
also who knows teens are doing on the computer
that is another downside to computers
most teacher prefer the essay typed and not written
i just want to remind you that their helpful a great learning resource and a great way to stay in touch
so if there is too much racism in a material then that should be removed
literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion
they not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long
life would be good
if i was a person who got offensive by something that was on the shelf at the library i would pass it up and not pay attention to it
what would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf
you should be happy from what town you are from
not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason
a showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat its faster and the two people can see each other
my always told me stays of the and stupid things he with his friend
to start with millions of people sign up for   and other website like these to reconnect with people
now you can d everything from your computer
but she does not have the mane
that pop music would make the kid happy
we as a community should love one another and respect them
it lead him through more barren lands
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
they must learn the good from the bad sometime
my first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others
this because computers do tasks such as helps research communicating with others and has fun games and websites
i know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer
the adults use computers for there work ability and in schools
some people would say that people spend too much time on computers
children simply are not ready or mature enough to be exposed to everything that books movies or magazines have to offer
if the act of censorship begins to expand everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive
if your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities you are most likely going to be upset
music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored in my opinion
the people all over india rallied around him
the mood created in the memoir i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
this tells the people had to stay strong through hard times
dear the newspaper in front of a after 
she uses geese as a symbol for spring when she would start preparing for this test once again
do you ever forget what your homework was or what time does something start and end
the first reason why libraries should not be censored is so they will not lose business
a computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds
internet gaming is very amusing and you can find many good games for free
we can only hope for the best
the computer was the only things that mattered
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library
you are addicted both your family  you suffer
as he rode on his confidence only faded more
arguing just decreases the social time spent
they could become obese and possibly get diabetes
but we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone
take a magazine for instance one reader could look like that beautiful women in that magazine and feel great about themselves
dear  people like computers a known fact
people still rely on computers just as much more today
i can remember my friend telling me that she always types her essays because its for her teacher and from typing
do you use computers for any of these reasons
if movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house
they can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable
i label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time
first they can help you learn about new subjects
he takes pains to explain the lessons
there would be more to do
lastly family and friends
the majority of students today crowd around a computer while they can be taking care of their body
every year tons of visit libraries in search of a good book threw act of observations and personal appeal
the cyclist then began puzzled and distraught
finally computers can be useful for schools and work
no parents want to walk around and hear there children saying these things or doing these actions
in some way yes but in other ways no
the setting affected the cyclist in several ways
are talking about the health this 
libraries should not have the right to censor material
we meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize so that is one disadvantage of a computer
the same thing could be said for these materials in the library
they stand for these values but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do
censoring could become a casual thing and books could be thrown out daily
the author include s the last paragraph to show that she still has hope
he could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street
take out the offensive things or just put them in different sections
basically you can search anything on the internet you are on the right website
it not have been perfect but he managed to find the good parts
our life revolves around technology in general as the revolves around the sun
this can lead to bad things like being stalked or kidnapped
libraries should have a rating system like movies do
i think the mood created in this story is love
offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections not the children section
the snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey
for example if you are playing games on the computer for hours it can strain your eyes
we can inhale fresh air if we have more trees on this earth
this is a good idea for all of us
there are millions of sites containing such content
at some places they are used to carry heavy loads
next computers can help you learn new things online
he has to keep smiling against all odds
they sometimes have to endure extreme climates
people can be discovering many great wonders
there are a lot of people out there who like to read
sure you can find out that is having that big blowout sale but you cant search up the best deal
the internet is perhaps one of the greatest things ever invented
budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework and go on the computer is also very important
not finished
she went through a change much like the geese do every winter
communicating is something else the computer helps with
so this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age
if we could less to other serious problems
have you ever wanted to know what the capital of is or what the weather is in 
even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship
it also help people like cops
also there is the question of what is offensive
if every person took off a book that they thought was offensive there would be no books left
since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south
lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference
the child will ask the caregiver that they are with  does this picture mean
an hour later we came back to our house
everybody praised the courage and brave action of the young boy
in this world diversity exists everywhere
when a person uses a computer they have to keep an eye on the screen but still be able to use the mouse or keyboard
we can learn about the climate
one way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news traffic and weather
computer i think are a big help in the world
you can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing
many of my own friends are update status or pictures on for three hours every night
our public libraries should take it into their own hands by changing their censorship
an examination is like a fever
however are all of these materials appropriate for all visitors
would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in
a world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today
they make pongal rice by cooking rice with milk and jaggery on this day
so should context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it
well about of the world says that computers are a great way to communicate with friends family and different people around the world
the social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world
computers are too useful
of students at say that when assigned or paper or project the first source they use is from the internet
information put them in order and give them to us when we need them
he sad when i tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid
no one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect
her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive
for movies music and magazines there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them
but  as a student looking into the future  i have a opinion 
bullying has been a major problem in the for many years
who be the final judge as to what books be banned
one person lend that book to another therefore the offensive book is being spread around
lastly computers are harmful because they also a deadly we open
his book taught me a few things and made me think different about people
library should be a place for learning doing work and reading
everyone should be able to watch what ever they want with out it having to be censored
all of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer
also it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water
finally there are many online games that are very useful
if these young people are curious and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons then let them be
so they will choose to maybe find offensive materials
first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about cultures around the world
also people play to many video games on the computer too
then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined
but just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity
minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read listen or watch
with millions of different websites the internet has endless possibilities
it helps them store data files and important information
moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me
the people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others
it seems like he had a good childhood
instead of separating the kids surprisingly they started quarreling amongst themselves
they make collections in the name of relief and misappropriate for personal benefit
that is great for the brain
and  did they let my child check that out
to take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers
i think it good to have computers because when your younger and no more friends you have been really to them but you with them
soon we will become the leader of and we will get to the decisions around
an article is made to show the pros or computers more people will experience the wonders of them
says is very entertaining but is not brain damaging
do you think books music movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries
i believe that computers benefit society
in my opinion these types of materials should stay on the shelves
the would always have junk food when was on the computer
when she returns she plants the hibiscus
in fact the real life situation would seem to be more offensive
in the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help
what if someone burn down you home this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them
what be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion not be bad in others opinionated views
well you want an answer and i will give you one
back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don need to pick it up
this affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty
 it gives students the to learn different places
then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test
do you want that
hidden information could be good and bad but mostly bad most people want to know the truth rather than a lie
i believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening
nowadays many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there
i believe people should not spend much time on their computers because it can hurt their eyes
the library is a pathway to knowledge which branches to many different cultural roads
if something could be offensive it is disposed of
for example teens can learn the new dance
nature is being ignored  more than ever
so in all ways the computer is anything but bad
she does this i think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden
here the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home
they were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine
internet  and libraries can all be under parents supervision
the girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant
you can talk to people long distance
it make some people upset and if it does then they should stay away from it
upon seeing it she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality
the author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone
computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very relaxed and happy
a movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog 
when she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden
if the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult
an age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision
this was taking a physical toll on him
who wins the people who find then offensive or the people who enjoy them
dear officials at the  have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives
this tells you that the road is very rough
there is books that teach you a lot
their going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though
the did this because so they would not have anyone try to be a rebel and over throw the 
no matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it
then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for with the wide selection the library has to offer
the cyclist then came to a huge hill and using his last bit of energy rode down
but you must control what you do on them and how much you use them
so is it right to remove offensive material from libraries
  the author explains to us how peaceful and happy his home was
dear local newspaper you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study
computers have a massive affect on some peoples life
i do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store
even people want to know where are some people from
none of my friends would have seen or told me about it
a case take action to stop using computer 
others have different ideas
step out of your door and you are faced with indiscipline
also it is a desert so it is very hot and dry
we would be living in a much more healthy and clean word
some people spend way too much time on the internet
do you have any idea how much it would cost to even try to retrieve this data
they usually stay up all night playing games or going on 
i believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones
something that they want to express by telling raping
this all swim like a activity but it is really pulling us away from our social lives
how would you feel
nature is beautiful it has  green grass rainbows sometimes
most importantly you can communicate with family and friends online through   or 
you could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out
reason being is that that was their store and we had no right to remove anything
allowing our culture to become way can lead to various sorts of problems as we have seen all to well
on the logical side of this the more a person knows the more power one has
the adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room or on a different level of the building
the next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain
i have to study hard to become a doctor
the company wants to make money and so does the author
listen to what ever music read what ever books or magazines that you want
this communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset
the author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time
the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower she will adapt to the terrain and toils of 
computers are very great to have around
the story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect
they explained to the reader how really important family is and how thankful the author is for his family and all the life lessons they have taught him
people in this country have the right of speech
soon i was fully drenched
there was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet
in the story the setting greatly affects the cyclist
this shows that the home is peaceful
let these young adults read about everything they are interested in
well you should really consider thinking about this those cant even reasons the people in the 
all these reasons and more are why i believe that computers benefit our society
you could tell he was passionate about what she was writing
vendors shout their wares at the top of their voices
so take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch
lastly why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker
but try this think of a book that changed your life for the better and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it
have you ever found or seen books music movies or magazines in a library that are offensive to you
and adapt to her new country
gather your family and plan a trip
this is where one realizes the important things
libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library
my third and last reason is to be organized
others spend it shopping or learning
a town is a town
dear local newspaper about what the world would be like without computers
i know i do
therefore we can protect their innocence and fellow youth
music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics
would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive
i believe that computers help our society
now they choose to surf the web instead
i went to serve my country
the features of the setting effect the cyclist in do not exceed posted speed limit
next day they changed the house and shifted to their son’s residence in the nearby colony
it is human nature to fear the unknown
a clueless society is a useless society and in the end they were destroyed
if they limit the selling of these items to minors these children will not have as many crimes all together
everyone loves staying on the computer
to communicate with my family in i use a webcam
it was then that i had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting
this skill could be used to pursue a good career in the carpentry field
computers can help society and learning so help the growth technology today
what could be better
their are great things to at the local park every day
if a song is beautiful and sweet but contains bad word in it is it a bad song
when i think of a computer i think of typing or a keyboard
the shortcut only leads him to thirst and no park
they were to type quicker that they could before
the arguing will never end
we learned a lot of information
its all lost in some pile of papers
they go out and do it
keep on reading so i could tell you all about my three reasons
people are able to send files ship  even order online
second computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family
these computers are an advantage to our learning and knowledge
finally thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers
those thing influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing
after the leap is taken even ten looks may not be sufficient
it read rough road ahead  do not exceed posted speed limit
she goes home  tells her mother she failed her test but bought the plant
computers allow people to easily
harry even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them
the sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer
if you have a report to do on of faraway place instead of looking through you can look on the internet for information
any way children become more social
in conclusion everything in the library should be censored
computers could also be used for good things
some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills
the mood of the in the article is like kind of happiness and  relax and grateful
would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read watching movies or shows or listening to music
stay in one room doing the thing for books for a in a while people need fresh air
this shows that even large important still use it for work
society computers to get information
for example a teenager say while typing a paper that she really likes to write
letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form
this is how to use mood correctly
there could be more things that would keep kids interested but only for a little bit
i believe that the effects on people negative
what is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult
also its not always about what the library displays but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read
that someone should just look at the other way because a library is for the general public
a sport or hanging out
but after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it
a is great way to bring your reading up
for example we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year
also not the miles into the next section of the ride he noticed a terrain change
increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day
there would be no way in pleasing everyone so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves
of course try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling  which is computers positively affect me
many people thought is was right
the way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful
so why would anybody take books off the shelf for being offensive
people need exercise to live
mother whenever plans a vacation looks up the country we are going to and gets more information about it
finally computer cost a lot of money
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
instead of finding the birth date of  she found a book making fun of and calling them inappropriate names
i was staying in my room and watching the weather outside from my window
this man  was assigned a from the farms of who had never been out of the fields
also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated
all people should have a computer
the budding of plant and spring represent new life
i think this because 
this leads to disaster
many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them but most agree that friends is one big factor
libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge
in this story they mention her helping her mother in the garden
that is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic
the features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist
there are many moods in this memoir
i also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday
i believe this because computers benefit by its online internet and overall help in other things
it is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us
my opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and i support this technology
within hours after the baby was born
if a child does not have a computer at home this will
the plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her
teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but out teens surveyed at admit getting that exercise
this need for the computer can be bad
another reason i have would be freedom of speech
in that same time people are getting fatter and they need more exercise
it is up to them as to what they want to watch not everybody else
if the books are censored then some messages might not get conveyed and misinformation run adrift
last reason is i know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier
kids could get help with homework online if they are too shy to ask another person
social life  you could have with all the people you are also will them
they include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy which not be fit for some people
speaking of which computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays
next all music should remain in libraries
i had to go see a shrink to get over those thoughts
for me reading books helps me escape the real world and catch a break
the author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow
i say again thank you for taking out your time to read this
libraries around the world need to better there restrictions even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young
help them pick out a book
how would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are 
now the internet for a person to such to find facts relating to their topic
when they see inappropriate items on library shelves what do we do
they contain vitamins minerals and fibers which give us the energy to work
we want them to be apart of our big events
some material when reached to a specific town can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community
i do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well
and if you a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer
one person might feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive while another person might think the book is informational and helpful
my mother got up early in the morning to give milk to the kids before they start screaming
both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers
the two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through
virtual tours are becoming more and more common today
who reads this
everyone says family is the most important thing right
get up off of your comfy computer chairs and take a walk
and it not only helps with baseball but with other sports such as juggling golf or tennis
if something is to be found offensive than it should certainly be removed from the shelves
see what i mean by a negative effect
and that was something that they could find in 
this is why we need to keep them all up
there are probably better more appropriate words to use when i am in public but then i would not feel like i am being quite myself
i say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books
next there could be a totally separate building for the offensive material
first reason is that many jobs in the state or nation use a computer
coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man
inf will agree that with more  these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided
this would make a parent cautious of where their child goes
i play lots of sports and i love them all
now if a gory or a book with lots of blood in it then it should stay on the shelves
more than out of people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal posted on them
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
these media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives
maybe it could turn out in a good way but really what are the chances of that billion to a thousand
this is a happy setting where the author grew up in
next when the cyclist comes to one ramshackle shed several rusty pumps and a coral he knows that things are in bad shape and he water
so honestly no one can say that a certain books music movies magazines etc
so then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives
he is grateful for his parents and for their love and sacrifice
and when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road
even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer
the countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills
dear local newspaper  show that of humans in the alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop
my last reason that computers are beneficial to or society is that they allow people to talk with other people
people used to read news out of a newspaper on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper
computers are helping the world become a better educated connected and informed world
that experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well my grandmother
now where going to talk about bad things that computers do
the lights of the nearby houses and of the bridge threw beams of silver in the river
sometimes life can feel so cruel
every individual is different in their own way
sometime those things are peoples life and all they do
so she wanted to take it again around the time of a new beginning when the geese fly over again and the plant grows
have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library
censoring books could take away from learning
they say that they are censoring what i need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers
readings is something that we cannot get away from
i found one i thought looked cool took it off the shelf and brought it up to the cashier
do you think books music movies magazines etc
with knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better
many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life
this includes children and families
well its true it can be bad but it matters how you use it
this tells our children that it is okay to do these things when it is the exact opposite
well no because they think they will get entertain by technology instead of their family
if you have a computer or a laptop and you need to find information on something the internet is there
libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend
everyone loves having a computer but have you ever thought what it can do to you
staying on the computer does not help the situation
more than that is kids
we would have nothing and the libraries movie stores and books would be empty
the absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey
i think a movie book or a magazine should only be uncensored if it is trying to get a point across
we want to stare at a screen and play games or chat with friends
this is my second reason
lastly computers let you meet new people online
now that is a big difference
that is also a typing game
and then we have no books on the shelf for any of us
dear newspaper readers many hours a day do you spend on the computer
but how can you have an education with out a computer
dear  the age of the computer is upon us
with more people making use of computers will be the more technology benefits our society
dear newspaper i think people need computers
there are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph
this system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material without taking it out of the hands of adults
it also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from
computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money
there are way to many people on computers doing anything you can think of for hours
my little sister loves going to the library
the same goes for any form of media
computers are not assets to society but issues
one’s profession cannot be considered as hisher leisure time activity
they can talk send pictures or play games
home that
a computer is just a simpler way to look up information
why not now
they should not be removed if found offensive to someone but not offensive to another
the libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music
with computers it makes it possible to go online look up the  research it and plan a flight there a week later
people take these machines for granted and assume we could live without them but i doubt they ever realize how much we really need them
these settings discourage him although he tries to keep hope
four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play
you can search up different information over the internet
punctuality means doing something at the fixed or appointed time
most people who do i personally think are immature
there are many reasons that this should not be passed
they all most create their own company
they could use the same method with books
this also includes email and blogs and some chat sites
it has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers  should we have them and advance them or not
for example the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly but rather flat and soothing
the setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness despair and fatigue
the computers can help you stay connected with them
there are however libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive
you can email fast
i have a few relative in  
they help you learn about faraway places talk to people who live faraway and play fun computer games
i can just go on the computer and search whatever i want
yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well and would not be a good idea
their are children correct
everyone reacts to things differently
there are many shopping sites online such as 
the modern bathroom had good cold water
he described this with sentences like rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain
i work with a spade and hoe every morning and evening in my small garden
because i think she feels hope and faith
also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically
if they get off they can and if they won to sit there and waste or
as every day people are getting in touch with technology they are losing touch with the world around them
spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy
she wants to be able to please her mom and herself she wants to be able to move on and starts her new life
this nation was built on the grounds of freedom for what you believe in
this angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the affected and shaped us into who we are today
the water was hot
the cyclist must have lost hope in civilization after he found abandoned examples of civilization
and the some i believe that child in the
no body ever said that they had to buy what the person in front of you is buying
the feature of the setting including the conditions weather and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist
you must understand how important this technology is to our society
if every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library everyone would be happy
as a  i doubt you say that research is a negative affect on school kids
because it means so much to us
therefore computers are very important for communication in our society
its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not
the most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet
inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books music and movies i believe things like that help shape us into who we are today
will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors
i do not believe that people should be given the right to do that
to help fight this cause
they help us with homework let us talk to friends and even help us do our projects
you will agree with me and why i think that
he was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal
they could also not be spending time with family
on certain websites you can talk to friends see what your friends are doing you can even video chat with them
sure many people spend way to much time on their computer but other people use it to save information or find research
for example turbo tax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and it remembers every tax you have paid
you can your job and talk to the people you need to talk to
also someone else is thinking different then they are
my suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books
the mood created by the author in the memoir is
i go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar
someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought i have when reading a scary book
so should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library
if your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day one week can your vision from a to 
he is a good cricketer
shows that the place is deserted
without water dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body but your mind too
for example the cyclist says sometimes life can feel so cruel
i have an that went to and is now in  and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in 
something has to be done about this
but mr kailash is my best neighbor
dear  the world forty years ago
so we need to act now limit compute usage
i bought a magazine
censorship is normally a bad thing but in others it could help
for example if i was to not go outside for a whole day and i got to spend my time on the computer i would be miserable
i knew i could trust him with all of my secrets
the setting around him also made him have negative thoughts
the author put powerfully
my friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day
clearly computers make it easier to talk to people
they should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things
the long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill
it was great fun
my standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the should be monitored
many features of the setting affected the cyclist in rough road ahead
the knowledge contained within them unknown
also computers prices are constantly rising
my concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives
however when you look at the facts a computer can teach a lot
the internet and computers are waiting to explode and invade the minds of everybody
so many people abuse themselves staying on to long
cries of mothers children whom they from
my friend found a website with very detailed information for an essay
this is all because of one little thing and that little things is the computer
she means that when everything returns and proves they survive she will too
whether the music movies magazines etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you
when the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps he decided to check it out and see if there is any water
hibiscus is budding this way the flower will be starting new and so will she
sohan lal is the peon of our school
they opened the engine and did some adjustments
how can they prove your age
so essentially by censoring works in libraries we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be
children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output
you should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer
for example might want to read a book about abortion but is against and offended by that book or subject
this idea goes the same for everything found at a library
in conclusion many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people
so go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive
in my opinion no
had a valid point
there is only one answer to this question of should the library be censored
it comes to be very useful for research projects or even learning another language
this paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story
having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint
some say kids are like sponges
movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older
can we somehow get kids to not see them
everyone writes up documents and needs to send them open them up again and edit them
additionally many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else
in the end home is about relationships rather than physical space
nature is so beautiful why ever it
they can also make grading a paper easy
taking certain books off the shelves have a negative effect on people
i believe this because i too want others to hear and read about my ideas on how to obtain lifeliberty and the pursuit of happiness
it can help you connect within your own family more
the amount of people that lack a sufficient quantity of exercise has risen in the past decade
this is why computers do benefit society
interest vary but a teen like the same type of books as an adult
these days its harder to not stay in touch than it to stay in touch
people trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine but you cant blindfold them forever
for instance i was mortified hearing that the first time
there is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive
he always takes part in the school athletic events
these are things you can do on the internet
soon the platform wears a deserted look
it went up almost from year and from the year before
someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others
dear  i understand that more and more people use computers and that can have a good side and a bad one
that decision however is up to the parents
it is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive
and instant messaging also give out society fast easy communication with others
if i were to go to a library now i would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine
if everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary
as you interact with people on the computers
its hard to see 
by next spring shell be able to drive
the author is explaining that he had family friends over to his house to eat almost every night
the computer is the item that organizes it for your entertainment
in conclusion computers are vital in order to properly function in many situations
you just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere
it would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it
fear and thirst start to get to him
the computer is good for connecting to people around the world
some good ways to spend time with your family is to play games together go on a walk or even go to a bike ride together
well if you really think about it computers help you
there is no one around to give him a drink of water
other people not even read the offensive book
this is what i think on the censorship on the book movies music magazine etc
taking away things does not mean your just taking away from one it means your taking away from everyone
also it symbolizes rebirth
secondly the computer is like a tutor
on festivals like christmas mr david arranges for a gettogether for all the neighbors in the common park
one highly controversial topic is race and if the book is not informing us about a historical event it should be removed
if a book can be published then it can be put in libraries
every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that
modern time and the people who disagree enjoy some family and friends lives far away and you cant talk to them in person
in school kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved
go right ahead
write a letter
my last but not the least reason is kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer
all other material whether be rapping or writing is acceptable
i was the only student in our grade that knew that answer
every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material
the issue to grapple with is should you take that risk or stay fit healthy and happy
books music and movies today talk a lot about sexual intercourse illegal drugs and criminal involvement
keep children in a safe innocent environment
after all the library is public and i put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different
the mood created by the author  in the memoir was grateful and it had gratitude
as well as webcams and email computers grants people access to communication websites such as instant messaging or 
one feature would be the dryness of the land
should there be censorship in libraries
if the setting were different this story would not have been as traumatic
magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that i take my child to
i enjoy reading books about people with special powers such as necromancers
the world has seen what can happen when things get censored
traveling on footboards is very common
the features in the story great effect the cyclist
it seems the cyclist has a lot against him
did you know what they are over one million of these kinds of websites
i have never came across a material that was offensive to me but maybe someone else has and it really offended them
i am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people ran benefit people in many ways
i also saw their coins and other articles
that gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test
i already know the answer
speech on advantages and disadvantages of science
i think that if there are books music  movies or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive
thankfully online college courses are available
parents can not always control what their children do
i think every should be like this it would help make the world a better place
its cool to not have to even got up to get what you want
when a librarian takes a book off of that shelf an opportunity is forever gone
i had the same reaction
if we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book we are teaching poor life lessons
throughout our twelve years of school students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions
the people started running to protect themselves from the rain
the flower brought back comforting memories for her so she bought one of the plants and returned
books have been around for centuries
with a click of a button you should be going to or a nice vacation
the reason i am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today
you will see a small rainbow before you
for example in the story it says but its strong enough to make it through the cold months
i myself am a musician which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator such as an author
he never gets angry
if they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go
he thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart
our beds houses televisions and even chairs are all forms of technology
after reading this i am sure you will agree
not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse
he then shows up at a ghost town
these things have evolved over the years thanks to computers
being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends
does make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone
a bad neighbor makes a hell of our lives
i without slight hesitation stand against censorship in every way
i know when i get bored i go on the computer and play a game called 
lastly computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world
but the books movies music or magazines that are felt like they are offensive should be move to a certain area in the library
they showed me with their lives and these teachings have been the basic of my life
first the printer can break
should just walk away from it
also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade
this shows why computers are bad
why would you want a future president to be a violent killing machine
if you need help to finding a book for your project ask the person at the desk where to find it
dear local newspaper i hear you are whether or not computers have a positive effect on people
i love my personality
dear editor have you ever used a computer
it have bad language in it and a bad theme to it
dear whom concern local newspaper
that is what i would do
in conclusion the books should stay on the shelves
 of people in the world use computers one time in their lives
obviously no one wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies
the author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time
but do they really consider both sides
currently there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society
it flew higher and higher
however is there any difference that we can find unique in india in our attitudes towards parents
computers are great for keeping in touch with family and friends at a distance
when a reader comes across a book that is against the way they see politics there can be a real problem
the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist
if you have children what do you think they do most of their lives
we should also pray to god for a good day
visit with family and friends or even exercise
these materials need to be censored more then what the are right now
they would rather just sit down crack open a magazine and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals
some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer
censorship of books is not fine but censorship of movies and magazines are acceptable
readers could learn from the books how racism affects people and why it is wrong
also it would not matter to me if i walked or drove or rode my bike to the library
it is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people
therefore its going to be very hot and hell need a lot of water t stay hydrated
i feel this way being that lack of email skills no exercising and its addicting
they believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library
in has become far more advanced
instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on you can make a decision simply to watch that kind of show
the moon is called a satellite as it rotates
not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area
censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose
this is how the setting features affected the cyclists
the mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better
to me the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a family problem than a social problem
the mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time
in the past their have been more negative effects on people
if there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off
children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically
dear local newspaper name is 
this is a very opinionated topic
people that have laptops can go outside on a sunny day grab some fruit and relax
the downsides of the internet
there are kids sections sections and even a teenage section
first it be a book movie or magazine that someone plans on reading and removing an item will let down the customer
i find it very dumb
would you be able to about from you living rooms without computers
this helps because people talking to other people online can beast there their morale
this is there because going to the library means you have to round up the kids get in the cor and go
do you use it every day
every second of the day their is someone on the internet searching for date that they would have to go to the library to get
there are many great effects computers have on and for people
dear i think that computers are beneficial to our society for example computers are very helpful to everybody
in all the games some rules must be followed
well the internet is here to help
people like things no matter what because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books music and movies
because of a lack of 
ironically the building was a grape juice factory abandoned and rusty but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable
that stood out to me because he really cared and was thankful for his parents
there are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life
there are kids sections adult fiction and many more
this shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds
the same case with my mom
after reading this information and the descriptions
then we will move onto the music and then the shows
it is as if the sun were taunting him telling him that he cant make it
were you ever given a school project to do but no book has the information you want
its better safe than sorry
maybe you have to catch up on your nightly reading for language arts and you want start reading your goal book
therefore people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families
then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
my mother believed that i should not read those novels at that age
but i say they are wrong
he is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink
i personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and have some violence in them
i understand that the parents want their children to be supervised but removing the books movies and songs is not exactly the answer
on the internet people can find information about faraway places or people
computers are the thing we use today
for one thing if you need to find out a important fact date or time
if that book is taken off the shelf it is restricting other people such as  who would like to learn or read about that specific subject
these are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries
studies show that of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time
studies have shown that of the people growing up with computers at home have a high paying job
the rusty water pump highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was
you can tell at first the mother is disappointed  then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood
no matter how far away they go
computers help people learn more and get a better education for themselves
and you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer
parents bring their children to the to support their reading ability and to advance it
if there are any books that have any types of adult content they should be in the adult section
a second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him
we type reports learn read online
as a student i know that kids use computers all the time
this shows how important the hibiscus was to her
another mood that was created by the author was sadness
i understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life
so we say something
new machines are robots are built all the time and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing
that was difficult for them but appreciated that
one important thing that i have that means so much to me  my is the that my gave to us right before he passed away
you can past messages play games or simply talk to someone on these websites
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way
computers are one way of communicating to loved ones in far away places
very many people are just too protective
ancient indian medicines prescribe cosmic colours to bring equilibrium in human cells
do you remember the last time you locked something up on the computer
obesity is one of the most brought up health problems in the world
computers teach us about interesting things like faraway places and people
i did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late
he takes the help of p t teachers too
first of all people will get fat
as you probably know not all kids are alike
we have the freedom to the way we feel or think but can it be to graphic for some to read
start doing things that people cant do on the computer
wonder how he was going to survive
i think people should not spend so much time on the computer
libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you
dear opinion is getting out of mind
i have noticed in my school alone that it is a rapidly growing problem
if you let periods of time then will help you with hand eye coordination
if you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive more than likely someone else will find it offensive too
she is an expert in teaching
when she explains the kitchen she talks about the music and the aromas and all the love of her parents
like i said be what was friend
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
yes computers benefit the society
i think it should be that way about every thing
the books magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves
some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to
all the facts of life and the world are put into it
take the book in the  for example
i honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age
without computers our society would not be so far advanced
you can learn history or about the present time
if it had been up to him he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world
this was making him dehydrated
my first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class
and i have to think  about the authors
but there should be time limits for how long people stay on the computer
instead the money can be spent on schools and especially the wars
to the  this day in age computer technology rules the world
computers can down
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had
one day he realized he could do this no longer and got same exercise
it was very hard to bike in these conditions and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going
one of the features was the lack of water
sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age
i think that this would be fair for everyone
be removed from libraries if they are found offensive
this is fine if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material
you can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends
it is airy
mind there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message
she went through a lot when she moved and seemed to have a sense of depression in the story
anyone can see what you put so you should be safe
to some people the strong words help the reader get the point across their head
sounds easier that looking up get the dewy decimal number find the number
once i got into the orchard and climbed up a huge mango tree
people all judge things differently
and they try to blame it on a book story or show they had seen
i made it into a beautiful garden
no matter who you are or what you do internet plays an important part in life
he no longer had that much water
lastly computers have made a lot of people when people got to too many people a major view when it comes to family and friends
most of the news can be very offensive
the people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read
dear  i believe computers have a positive effect on people
dear  i have heard the concern of many scientists about computers
you also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have and would they be able to interact with friends and family members
computers definitely have good effects on people
computers give education stand information to everyone
in the past year victim have committed suicide
so the mood in the memoir was love towards his parents
so to all the people who think that computer help anyone well reasons why computer can help someone
today computers are like the worlds biggest book of knowledge
however this book is seen as one of the centuries greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term
have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book
for example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well
so by you not burning off that fat you just keep gaining and gaining
my answer is no for the reasons i have listed above
it is necessary to water them every day
i hate all these because they will make us do wrong things
hints the name
computers and technology today have had a very influence on very many people
making friends or keeping up with the ones you have in a positive way help fight depression
you can have a video family
if people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints
thank you very much for your time and effort that you put in to listen to me
this is quite possibly one of the last things i would think of causing a problem if i even thought of this at all
in the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to 
there is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another
it just depends in what ways censoring is used
once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast
it was a lovely evening
if you ask anyone in school they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool
says the missing child agency
a lot of people in the world today are having this same question
then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road
many find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive
finally he reaches a bait shop and his water and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future
computers definitely have a positive effect on people when they learn new things
lastly i would like to express how i feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries
what would you do
moving to from about  computers have greatly helped and i stay halfway country
there is a reason why we are becoming one of the fastest countries
ever since computers were invented not only have they downsized but became more and more useful
there would be so many conflicts if this happened
maybe you just want to relax and learn plug in earphones and listen to math help
computers can be very handy when you want to know whats going on in other countries
the author creates a grateful mood
why i think we should have computers
you cannot see how a character truly feels
this is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer
seeing these things in books movies magazines and etc
it allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than seconds
also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in
i mean everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years and years ago
more and more people are using computers on a daily basis but i do not agree that this benefits our society
that is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs
there were no people around to help him but there was a snake
you need exercise to stay healthy too
you can know everything about that country without ever visiting
that book would be taken away from all schools in the brings us to this problem
plus there is not a bad book that your kids will find at school any way
by using censorship you are sheltering the world
this is what i think the mood of the article is about in the memoir
children need books to provide an escape to expand their imaginations and to help them in school and life
there is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer
they cannot ever make on the ones of a paper properly
you eventually memorize where all of the keys are located
you are the visitor click here to get your prize
every area can organise a special playgroup and other children should accept their disabled friends and play with them
this is the issue with taking books off the shelves
if you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located
at peak hours people try to board a bus whether there is any space in it or not
we use computers in life
magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library
libraries are meant to provide information anyways
social networking sites and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer
to special uses
it is very dangerous
i have a pet animal
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
many people not agree but i just tried to make people to see my point of this statement
now is the time to turn of the computer and go outside
this last paragraph reveals something special to the reader
this is an example of how censorship works
dear local newspaper in town use the computer for at least five hours each day
high profile documents such as the constitution should be held in high security areas
also to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large snake in the middle of the rode
movies are good about it though
so she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland
all he did was use that blasted electrical error call a computer
she took me in her arms and held me tight
thank you for listening
books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them
one reason i do not believe that there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it
whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song
dear newspaper has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much
the author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons
the mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp
this can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines
they use them to much these for people can stop going to gyms and get over weight
on the other hand are some books offensive to readers
by changing him physically
what are you going do
some people can and some people cant
he had received a big cut on the forehead
the librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library and have the kids book in the younger section of the library
after planting the hibiscus she watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat
because there is no logical reason for not to have a vote on what affects them
it was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst
i hope you can see why computers can be good for people
while many people enjoy the use computers there is really not that great a need for them
saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money
think about the conversations that go on in schools and at the work place
in this day and age computers are used for many things
dear  computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away
first you should always be happy no matter what culture your in
other people think that the computer is very helpful
for young children stay with the cartoon educational type things
do you like what i like
this also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be
there are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books
parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve
it also provides us with entertainment if we are interested in playing video games
it makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that
in libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate to serious or violent
also to conversations are fading
libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community
the teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic
they would not be able to show off what they really like
finally they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle
it is not illegal for a library to have a rated movie
they might find it easier with a computer
i think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer
now i told you all the reasons why i think using a computer is good
this would make parents of younger children happy but also the people wanting to view this material happy
another example i was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly
i once talked with someone on for over an hour
another way to speak to friends or family is a website called 
i think we all can agree with 
the world is maturing even as everyone speaks and people are learning all the time
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
i know for your company having no computer would be a nightmare
whether it was from a parent or even their best friend they have heard it
when you get punished it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of 
many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before
she had good relations in her house
it tells us what was happening in that part of the world
in conclusion i believe that is we are bad for society
these children need to be taught that there is other ways to do things
many people even work from home thanks to their computers
computers help children and adults learn so much
the soldier must be ready to overcome any difficulty
if a person took offense from a book or magazine i believe that person should just put it back
you can also buy thing off the computer
so yes my final opinion is that libraries should in fact censor their books or at least make an effort to
even though they can be use for many things like research
is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity
like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need
the average weight a year old has increased from pounds in  to pounds today
music on the other hand is very important to teens these days
they sprayed water on the house
this one is a sort of spear against the devil of carelessness
without a doubt computers benefit people in society in many ways
my uncle has named him brownie
these books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves
if you keep it up now it not seem bad but hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes
there are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities
in conclusion these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist
books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago morals were different a while ago from what they are now
waste her time on whenever is home when could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends
if people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said
typing skills are a great example
children are our future because when i am old they will be the ones who are caring for me so for me censorship is big deal for me
like all proverbs
post offices are very useful to the citizens
serious actions might come from the objects and later on come from the same child that either listed to saw it or looked at it
the terrain had made him drenched in sweat
there is no way to approve a book to not be offensive because it is not offensive to every person who reads it
if you were lucky you could find a bit of what you were looking for
very beautiful sight
second computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily
it depends on the level of intelligence maturity and age of the people who have access to these materials
the third reason why i think using a computer is a good because this allows you to talk online with other people
but who has time to go to the library and spend hours searching for an answer that would take a matter of seconds to find on the computer
like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor
with are of the largest number of members
when you see things you want to do things just as the what the magazine
other people think computers are hurting the citizens
by sitting up straight in your computer chair all day can improve your posture
some books movies magazines etc
there would be chaos and nobody would be able to live or even exist peacefully
by keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she came from
first books can be used as monumental learning sources for kids teenagers and adults
then the terrain in changes when he says flat road was replaced
it also gives you location and dates of different events that have happened in what you are looking up
not everyone has the same opinion on things
all around the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex
i believe that offensive books music movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries
the last mood that their was was harsh and sacrifice
the library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material
so i think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like everyone likes something different
now i understand there is a vast amount of people who are against my position
this quote means that his parents mood was careful and do anything for people if they needed help
dear newspaper the question is whether or not people are spending too much time on the computer or not
people never have enough time for activities
my first reason i think computers have terrible effect on people is because its a waste of time
doing that is like putting duck tape on the writers mouth
when i went to a skate board demo at skate lair i had tons of fun
for example  be over there by my clock hanging on the wall i want you to knock it off so get away from it 
in return they were respected
what is in these stores only makes us stronger
students of all classes visit the library as per schedule
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
also the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony
have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive
many things on the cyclist journey affected him
people are concerned
this paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story but mostly reflection
it gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in
another good reason to be able to use the or computer is you can talk to family members who joined the 
books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything without a purpose should be thrown away
the mood to put it in general terms is happy
they lack motivation to exercise as well as help around the community
if you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it make things more difficult
i think this for a few different reasons
if a piece of is particularly offensive the piece should not be displayed
most of what i would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people
from school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there
different people find different topics offensive
in some schools they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home
there are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment
me for example i love working and playing on the computer
dear  i think that having a computer is a very positive
more over it will bring more danger to you and your family
i disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why
so when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map
also after taking a poll
also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it
sure there are somethings that are very offensive to certain people and those people will try to put a stop to it
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
for example education has vastly expanded since the computer
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
for example a friend of mine is on the computer quite often and has developed a weak immune system
so get up and write our local news paper telling them why computers benefit our society
also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high
sitting at home on the couch eating a bag of potato chips
students have to learn them when they study mathematics in higher classes
if he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be in the story
if we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history
also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family
therefore with such positive affects should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done
some items are not appropriate for everyone though
dear local newspaper in my opinion i feel like to many people spend to much time on the 
your already sitting anyway so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself
nowadays we do not come across a snake charmer so often in delhi
people have the right to choose what books they and what they about
when does our first amendment right to free speech with censorship and too much censorship meet
the weather can change my level of ability sometimes
computers help people study learn and even talk to other people
in addition i happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks
i think it is okay for people to use computers because they get to learn new things and meet new people
all this show that where was he born how he got her and him getting a better life
dear newspaper i strongly believe that technologies for kids and adults to use computers
we need to show them that we know what they doing
it seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence
i could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society
they can submerge themselves into obesity
we could be improving obesity spending more time with family and friends and exploring nature
in the current day and age the environment is a growing concern
in the beginning of the cyclists journey he is very happy and carefree
the girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over she will start over too
for a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us
some offensive things are part of and shows how things progressed from back then to now
now you know how to fix your problem get going
like you are writing an article on dolphins you could learn more about them
all books are written to be read and with the division of such books everyone can agree upon this books help us grow
by doing this we can get rid of censorship and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as 
many song artist write about love money and fame yet others write about drugs profanity and suicide
for example news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish
the silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society
lastly you can use a computer for world news
but do you see that every day in this generation not at all
overall society needs computers and they have and overwhelming positive affect on society
i think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again
they provide a lot of information
is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age
amazingly the computer is filled with knowledge like this
so keep computers
there are parents that allow their children to read listen  and watch whatever they want
and just when you think you find something everyone likes someone will come along and disturb the peace
or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones
when you have a computer you can get influenced by other musicians to create music
you can be helpful
say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it
also he did know where he was go
this selection has a soft nice and good mood
is for all of these reasons i strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community
they believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills 
then it comes up in about seconds with around links to websites to help you out
i know personally that it has help us
i hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive affect on people
lastly this gave me the mood of love
i remember one time when i was in the middle of writing a report online
one day we will end up like the world in 
should books magazines music and movies be removed from shelves if found offensive
so this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or group of people find offensive
due to time difference it is hard to stay in touch
computers are not a bad thing but its is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health
you could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games
lastly it could be bad to get though life without your friends and family
hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom
more and more people use computers everyday
plane and simple
overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him
he reaches school before us to clean and arrange our classrooms
can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment
they can help contact friends and family from all over the world
this lets people explore the world and do anything
to ignore leaves you in fear
people say that computers waste our lives
one feature included the first ghost town that he come by
nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home
then after that i can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out see
i would want my children learning anything and everything about world history
what ever you want you got it
the things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world
you can see the foreshadowing
all of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone
along with this is video chatting where you can have face to face conversation with somebody even on the other side of the world
all the teachers and students like him
i think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning
you can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live
there is not a person in the world who has not had some form of communication with others
and i want on 
people have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say whether that be in written form or verbally said
dear newspaper of  the use of the computer is a controversial topic
or try it for themselves
of teens are shopping by brand names like    
i interact with my friends of us population between the ages have a 
she was alone living with her husband who was not well and confined to bed
he took the help of another bus driver
he can use the computer to help him find that phone number
recently i was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for a process that would take a human weeks
so how are we suppose to know what offends who
there is nothing wrong with that
one of the ways computers help people is through improving their hand eye coordination when a person learns to type and look at a screen at the same time
computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable and the can be fun too
whether someone knows it or not when you are typing fast it is help you hands
computer addicts do this almost everyday and before they know it they are
i look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another
do homework  projects and store important files
he also orders his flight tickets in his computer to go to 
the mood of this memoir is being thankful and is presented in all these different ways
not every student employee or other person can spend that time looking for an answer
the business side should be more then enough for me to convince you
besides no ones making you check out that book
they teach us things entertain us and are sometimes good pillows but they can also be bad things
loved how his parents loved him back too
the mother says 
in fact the are the best bet for a better future
 required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens
so they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that but it is not
have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book
it is not being effective most times
removing those small things however could grow into a bigger problem
the conclusion of the story is that she do like nature because she talk about the hibiscus
this affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness causing him to push more and more to reach water
dear local newspaper have you ever forgot the book you needed for homework
these skills can also help us do more things at once
you can learn a lot from a offensive show you can learn what and what not to do
the features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not
the dolledup bride accompanied by her sister and friends arrived walking at a slow pace
in the ramzan season they go to the mosque to pray
is why i think there should be guidelines or rules
this implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings
the cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out no one could help him
as a teenager each book i look at its always about sex or gang violence
that would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they cant
financial loss is something that many people are concerned about
offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it
in my experience some music is just too offensive
i surveyed kids and said that computers are there main source of communication
the last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard
i learned to get my voice heard i needed to do it in an appropriate manner
when you go to the various sections of your local library what section do you start sprinting towards
prince siddhartha married a very beautiful princess named yasodara
i agree with the statement of in some degree
this he had lost hope and hung his head
also i think if there is bad music it should be taken off the shelves
society possess a big problem
of all the places taking things off of the library shelves is not going to do justice of what really needs to be done
another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society
the library workers know what they are doing
computers are helpful on finding information making your work less difficult
and movies right from your computer
computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends
all you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision
but what are they taking away from us
now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the 
there are books that children or young adult should read and should not read
and maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer
and would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet
writers state things that to some degree offend one in a million people
there are many things a person can do on a computer
how this benefits you is because you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them then video chat
reading that book should let you see how that child grew up
a very big one
views on what should be censored and why vary based on type of person and their background
computers help people stay in touch computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways
getting lost will also lead to dehydration tiredness and heat stroke
there is a place for everything in a library and most of the locations are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is held there
this place was completely deserted and there was no water for him
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water
but if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them

its the most common thing to go on the 
they should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in
second we can learn about faraway places
so go on a computers and talk to your friend even that person a picture or something
all the computer is is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy
a few things that i would find that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs nudity horrible violence and bullying
limit the time on the computer
they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people teach hand eye coordination and allow people to communicate with each other
what do you do get on your computer
its all about how you look at books movies music etc
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us

this be one of the biggest causes of obesity in 
falsehood leads to evil
i can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors
if every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests there will be no material left
all kids should have 
but i mean those are only my opinions
i achieved a lot of knowledge by reading various books and newspapers
censorship is a tough topic to discuss
just think you sitting in the house on a rainy day bored out you mind and have no thing to do
yes it dose have a positive effect on some people
you should only go on the computer if you really have too
and then when comes a computer can be great not to worry about not having enough time to go and
my first reason is natural disasters
then there is the issue of offending people
for example adults can look up whatever they chose on the internet and so can everyone else of all ages
the concluding paragraph to the story winter hibiscus gives a sense of hope for the future
she believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read

lastly is a website where you can add friends from all around the world
when my grandparents went to school they had no idea what a computer was

so there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools
this is because of less exercise less time to enjoy nature and interacting with family and friends
when i was a kid in grade i read a book far beyond what most graders read
to sum it up many things about our lifestyles need to change
would you rather us not have computers and not know half the stuff about we live in
we should be permitted to say anything we want even though in our hearts we should know what is right and wrong
though i am not trying to benefit those whom seek the material i think it would
i have one more reason why i think computers benefit not effect
every parent has different rules and guidelines for their children and this is their right
all you have to do is make a word document and type with the keys
i think the memoir is a very heartwarming story of a family that loves one another and his thankful that they have a place they can call home
like say a high school paper
computers affect all of these areas of our lives
criminal acts vulgar language and more
we lives so i think use should using them
the winter is the current season and spring is on its way
it is a bright object in the sky
also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too
you could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to
everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media
we can chat with our friends which is very useful
however there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research
we learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of facts
not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines
you type in something you will get what you were looking for
there are many ways in which the setting of rough road ahead affects the cyclist
technology lets everyone explore new topics
it has a stone building
i just think that computers are ruining the life of many people
some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences
both of these very different settings gives off very different feeling
who in the world would say a computer is useless
will effect their life in some way
so if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic
there is nothing to worry about
we need the different opinions in life
i have given you three reasons on view of censorship in libraries
they can have different sections such as adult children and young adult
but very few play badminton
dear  people have computers and people use them
lastly you basically do anything on a computer
authors editors photographers and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves
they use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time
the author also shows how close their family is
instead of censoring our youth of from history we need to set age limits
the bad thing about computers are hackers and people that wont get off their computers
computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends
your friends are going to start pulling away from you
so he moves on and finally he re aches life
you can have fun with your family by playing games
you can learn about whats happenings in other parts of the world you can learn things about celebrities and you can look at the weather
high and students are going to hear
the last mood in the memoir is happiness
this is the kind of violence children read about all around the 
there are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves
in the evening he returns home
books music movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways
the is a public place that allows people to read what they want
out of have at least two computers in the house for a reason
i seen so many materials that i think are not proper for people under age to been looking at
he was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road
well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it
that is why i think the author used such a powerful statement at the end
you even forget the people you know even where you live if you spend to much time on the computer
over all i think that libraries just need to reorganize there books movies and magazines
lord buddha was one of the greatest religious teachers who ever lived in the world
what have we do to people
i found that book to be very offensive just because i was looking at it from a modern perspective
influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives
say yes to computers good effect
they are very convenient
they are either black or green in colour
for example i like to listen to hard rock heavy metal and rap
it be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book
he tells how even though his community was made up of many races they still lived in friendship and unity
the purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners
my conclusion is if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at
previously i stated how people spend time with loved ones well people need to spend more time doing activities as well
computers provide entertainment to people
the people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive the way people take in information is the main factor
he gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground
you will never know because everyone has there own and who knows whose opinion is right
speech on the educational value of travelling
it seem like i am on a lot but really i have something
dear newspaper i strongly believe that computers do not benefit society
libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things
the first stomach store the food that is not completely chewed
i have long brown hair
instead on some chips while typing
she though of how strange it was
the mood the author creates in this memoir is gratitude
books have been around for a very long time
compared to real life and nature there really is no comparison
two they can look up things to help them
computers benefit people all over the world
there would be no rented movie stores theaters or success in the movie production industry
do you know how dangerous some websites can be
now for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job
yes some of these way can be dangerous but are safe
does this mean anything to you
not only can i seek help from others on my computer but i can stay in touch with my friends and family
computers bring no adventures just pictures of them
this is alarming because at that rate people never get to know each other and the world become an electronically based workspace
and the library need more style for the people are excited and take the books and read
you want to do as you can so you have that at
physically he was tired and worn out
dress up to educational
i like to play with my kittyi love her very much
first computers have a negative effect on people including chicken because computers are not safe
by saying he was doing when it should have been 
but he was a poor student
dear newspaper i think computers are a good effect in our lives
dear newspaper in think that computers are not good for the society
i think you would find more things about that person that you would in books
but do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library
in conclusion sections in a library can be used instead of censorship
there were people of all ages outside the ticket window
later on that boy was caught and punished
to others however it draws them further and further away from the story
the computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool
this is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy
every morning we should wish our elders
usually this game requires very tall players
also it says that they came selflessly as many immigrants do to give there children a better life
today a lot of children and teenagers are getting bullied
the cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain
if you need information on anything you can search it
also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication
this would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about
well you could go on a computer and look for food online
to many children take the movies to the extreme and try and act like the actors or actresses and the children end up getting hurt from these actions
there are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms
also computers can teach us things
a place where the citizens can check out books music movies magazines and more
they are a way of communication  and allows students to do better in school
he sleeps for a few hours
computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable but best of all its right your fingertips
in conclusion computers do not benefit society
this makes it easy for strangers to
you can also use the computer to research topics
they instant message listen to music go on   or 
they put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini
i think as far as the child part of it  that no  children should not be aloud to read things that be vulgar sexual  etc
search engines such as    and more allows us to research anything we want to know at just the click of the button
to  eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace
when they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else
what kind of society would we have then
if all different races want censorship then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people
i hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today
computers as you can tell are extremely helpful easy and fun to use
his daughters are students of class nine and seven
breathing in some fresh natural air can really calm a stressed child out
are you 
some experts say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that be true to some people its not true to everyone
one condition on why a bookmoviemagazinemusicetc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it
the computer can give you plenty of 
after reading the book i always wondered why they called her she
is this good for our country
need to go outside more and be active
so as you can tell computers make a strong positive impact on society
but who knows where technology can take us
i would rather the world be an educated place with minor dangers then a place where everything is kept secret and safe
while growing up
they also find them in libraries and the more they read the more they want to do because they are influenced very easily
whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library
it was a chocolate cake with juicy cherries on the top
it is also not another persons right to decide what other people can and cannot observe
we also have a pair of lungs which help us to breathe
so then they call there buddies and say lets try this and most of them do then there in trouble
just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer
this proves it is extremely hot outside
its now called an email
for example 
peacocks were in large numbers
you can search any topic and learn more about it
i have give yous you the facts the rest is up to you
advanced coordination would mean that person would able to accomplish more things like fast typing
along with that they have online books so if they forget their real ones they can still do their homework
i see those books as our history those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up
the internet is a great source for reviews and ratings of books
i think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child
this way you are not completely removing it but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it
if the choice is left to them that material might not be available to the reader that needs it
although not always real it touches people on an emotional level
furthermore instant messenger is the most addicting
libraries always need advice
that could easily go wrong if children teens etc take it more than just a movie
censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy
that contributed to the evil practice of expecting money on the slightest pretext from the patients or their relatives
but his determination led to success and arrived into a town
plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
these are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir
you need them to see how you are doing financially computers are essential to our and economy
they had left friends family jobs and their country that they had loved
the hibiscus inspires her and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country
i do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising
it was great because it was right on the computer
computers can most certainly improve our society
not only are they helpful but they are necessary and i hope your agree with me
computers encourage users to be more organized
i do that all the time and i like it
imagine sitting at the computer completing every assignment and doing every homework there is
so what i am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life
they might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it
in our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
therefore i strongly advise not to take any books off the selves
everyone has their point of view
using the internet world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds
instead of being on the computer learning hand eye
if you need to know something you can just type it in and boom
that would be on the parents plate to deal with
one other way to speak to others more for business reason is 
well i know i have
you can even earn a college degree on the computer
that is my opinion on computers
this can make families keep in touch and friend close
everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions
computers are a great tool to help us with our lives they help us learn skills for later in life
i think they should make a floor people can go to to hangout and talk
i hate selfishness also
public libraries are even with the widespread usage of the internet important places for us as residents of a city to socialize and learn
the features of the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways
there should be no problem
but libraries are to learn about many things such as reading for fun reading the newsletter or just looking for random information
a sense of security with friends families and neighbors
this statement shows him going down the hill
however i strongly believe that this should be limited
i hope you agree with me
i think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves then it should at least be marked as offensive
instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game
children and teens need to be protected from this major threat
everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too
students be dancing to their favorite song
i will never forget how my parents turn the simple house into a home
computers are becoming more advanced everyday almost everyone owned or owns a computer
it should not
but who is going to tell them that and what is the answer
he keeps on however and at last sees a shop where he can get water
i love to play with my dolls listen to music and read fairy tales
then you can see others face to face
if they are overweight their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge
these have been some moods in this story
it read rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
i do agree with you on one thing
gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide
movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me
children are going on the instead of doing there homework
and very generous because her parents moved for her education
the second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places
education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now
first i think that computers can sometimes make you smarter
he is a very good man
i also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will
what even happened to cellphones you can take
lastly computers have a positive effect on people
we can interact with each other
that would lead to hundred of kids with on obesity problem
it is all helpful in the end
the authors wording was very well done
the mood portrayed in the story was family and friends are very important and they help what you will be in the future
for examples my pictures of my baby cousins so people can see how their growing up
in my life there have been numerous obstacles which i have had to persevere through
so what else did they say
the sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up no matter how tough the situation
you can even play poker on your computer
so as a result i keep in contact with her through the computer
most books on sex teaches you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay self
dear newspaper i think that computers were one the best things ever created
one such feature is the hills that are present in the essay
libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking discovery and learning
they can learn and even interact with
they were loving to all and they sacrificed a lot to get to where they were
from my own experience i know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie
they save work on their and they use computers to build things
the features of the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affect the cyclist
you could search up a lot of stuff
these should not be available in a library cause anybody could rent them
a recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer
this is very urgent situation so please be aware
the time is now to understand the full benefits of computers
is where about half of the libraries money is being made
but it seemed that she realized how the plant was able to bud to the odds and survive
artists are ones to take risks and so are writers
some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people
computers are essential to our present day lives
the cyclist said that this sight was troubling
all of these things in the setting affected the cyclist
some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits
i have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do bad things no
traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills
finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road
he had a number of dogs cats birds hares tortoises ponies etc
if people spend all their time on computers then do they exercise
many people use websites to check the emails
it would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books
seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people
the train stated
people are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important
on television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff
if you just take a step back you notice how valuable something really is to you
it would be all the more reason for him to give up
the author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing
it means giving up the right to say and think however you want
if children are separated and exclusive to adult material i see no problem in having these items on the shelves
what are they doing on the computer you ask well lets find out
the child brought some fruit for me
this ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people
he studies in grade eight
along with all that though it gives love an copy
i think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
one of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world
now we have computers we should use it
then preach his doctrine to laymen
i say this from experience
some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies or songs say to do
dear  i strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and the society
unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones
dear newspaper i read an article in the newspaper that said how people on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit
my last reason on why computers are good is because of studying one thing that always happens is i leave my textbook home
he is a very hardworking man
i think should be a matter of choice like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the 
they cannot
she is sad and misses her home especially after failing her drivers test
will leave someone with nothing to read now
toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test
i think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book
we know the roads rough when he says large highway signs dumped out at me
the internet is a wonder place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics
the heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired
with all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey
in this essay i will describe to you why i think this way
she knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do
for example what if you came from another country
i read a book that was offended to me but it told me how to react to the situation and how to overcome my situation
the building was there but it was abandoned
without computers i would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as i can with computers
that he almost died most of missed read it
lastly when you have a big project you can do research on anything and everything in the world
it also helps by accessing and surfing the internet to more useful stuff
the answer is yes computers are a good teaching tool
would you ever read a book about the times if your 
plus there are many different disorders in the world
are maybe really good books
and while certain groups advocate to protect the children of from these offensive works the children will still find a way to access them
as you can see i have stated many good reasons
its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books
and and are fine for any age group
i see literature as another form of art
this concludes that computers benefit the society we live in today
the was a dark time
have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate
second have you ever asked your self about much time you ever spend with friends and family
many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others
do you like computers
in this case people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting
my mother kept them carefully in my room
censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter
she can quickly type up an essay or research a science topic instead of doing painstakingly slow using an old fashion method
however i believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries
but computers can do anything
it is better to go outside you got fresh air its nice and cold
you have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it
certainly going on the computer will mean less time for exercising
with the advances in technology average people can be updated on the new around the world every minute
chairs were arranged for the parents and other guests
that  uses about the same amount of energy in as regular light bulbs in hours that light really saving you that much money
also i believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean nasty and offensive materials
it is the most important festival for muslim people all over the world
helps life if you work in a office or a trademark
who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie
and have fun
music should not be as much of an issue as books
kids will become overweight
the creator of each song movie song magazine or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer
the next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride he had to do and that made him disappointed
libraries are a place that someone can go to to learn about something
now lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users
if an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid
you need to have steady hands
in addition to my first reason computers help long lost friends
throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people cars or buildings around
my   has a computer class where we learn how to skillfully type
we have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources
not even a library has all the information you need
grapes of was banded because their was slavery in it
its their job to
now tell me who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested
this made his journey very dangerous
i think the use of computers in our town are very good for society
there are some names for instant    and many more
the best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you
well we need to do something about all these materials that are offensive and banned them for good
computers help us to find information we needed
computers are more practical than books
using the computer this way is another terrific idea
every book has a different plot and a different moral
some have never been offended
i know you as a would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would
in my opinion we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family
when she goes back to take the test shell have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test
everyone wants to live like there dying or in other words live life to the fullest
this is why computers have a positive effect on people
nobody has the same views as everybody else each person is different in their own way
because they help people learn about faraway places
looking for an adventure of your own you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking
the magazines always have girls half clothed even in seventeen magazine
furthermore advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people
the plant represent her home
you can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on
but at the same time we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer
these materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned
i believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people
the setting affects the cyclist because hes in the middle of nowhere with no water
a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
then they began their investigation
so you could say your happy with your weight but no one ever said it was healthy
i sure we all know at least obese person or teenager
as he goes along his confidence starts to wither away
it is an important thing to think about
by typing or even just clicking the mouse students are bettering their coordination
like the geese
what should we do people ask and she says well take away the 
is much more beneficial than learning how to type or talking to your friends
when the cyclist did approach a town it was abandoned
with computers everything is easier
well according to over billion people use a computer worldwide
it has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way
one reason is the you could talk online with people
my mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love
this gives me the feeling of thankfulness and to really admire what my parents have done for me
my school has a very big library
that means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding
this represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on
with any luck id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat
some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
they help you learn have fun and communicate with people faraway
thank you for taking the time to read my opinion
so he was out of water and was going to be thirsty
so now i leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge
then i was able to check a book out
that is what i think affected the cyclist
at first people waved a friendly hello but nothing more
as long as those books music magazines movies etc are put in the right section
like spending less time with your family getting addicted and unhealthy
the next day i might learn something in school that i want to search deeper into
computers have helped advance medicine as well
say if you an your friend has the same computer which includes webcam video messaging and more
computers are good were ever you go it can look up for a project for school
as he begins to see how hope
the constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well
but the only types of people that those books movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids
is always exceptions to whatever people say
dear  i think that computers have a positive effect on people
suppose one is participating in a horse race
computers take away time to actually use your mind and problem solve in real life solution
that is how it should go
finally online predators are a great threat to teens
also you lost all your friends contacts
then there would be no more author and more actors and actress
there are things people will not agree with
the mood i think of his warming happiness and joy
but is it good for you
let alone read about it in school
computers also can give you dieting tips and advice from live locals
they can get this practice from exercise catching ball threading a needle or using a computer
the way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too
i myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for
i am very fond of my dog
the most challenging problem faced by the author was the lack of water
this day and age is evil all around the world
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
some people work at home on computers
what i think the cities that have a bigger population should consist of two libraries side buy side
the books are ranked critiqued summarized back cover summary and even sorted in a library
what if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal
with this process every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed while the ones that truly deserve it are removed
if you have a close friend who moved across the country then these ways to communicate would be very helpful to you
the cyclist was tired and exhausted
video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends
you know says that over of people will never go in nature they get a computer
these negative comments will get nowhere in life
 i am writing this letter to inform you about the use of computers
so please take the violence off the shelf
kid just sit at home  play computer games such as sims  video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them
they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as 
so once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred
anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make
after reading all the facts surely one would agree that a is a great tool that should be used
your child finds a magazine
another can people computer spend less time with family and friends i was watching television and playing on the computer
the factory even made him more thirsty
so i suggest you pick one up and just have a blast you wont be sorry
that is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do
when you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves
i can make a connection because i have both a and that i use to stay in contact with family friends from all over
this affected him a lot because the desert is very hot
giving people facts about faraway places
for example the sun was beginning to beat down
with temperatures being high it is easier to become quickly dehydrated
removing offensive books magazines music and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints
most of the time people have to do essays
this amazing device can also let you talk to people online
with him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat
they are the best technology because you can do anything on the computer
that means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger
using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever
yes we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want but i think it should only go so far and then should be stopped
my first reason why i feel that computers have bad effects is
patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
nobody is forcing to read that specific book libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books
the other girl answered
books are known to do this to people
there is also a nice bakery shop just outside the market
the author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else
this quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going
but we can choose to read what ever you want to
it represent that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness
book tend to be censored and even banned at schools
do you think the adolescence would want to waste paper because their messy handwriting and mistakes
i believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines
people can only choose what they want and nothing more
the author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her
throughout the excerpt it shows his gratefulness towards his life living with his family his life in his home and his overall life living in 
but how is this possible with some people going to work everyday and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day
there are some effects computers have on people that i agree with and disagree with
lets go farther on
people were already becoming lazy because of television
they allow people to communicate their ideas and opinions
have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf
last sunday my father had to go to the heathrow airport to receive his uncle
let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility
lastly computer can make people unhealthy
people spend to much time on the 
or listen to it
computers help people do all kinds of things
finally the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph the story is complete
they carry very helpful information
then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves
when the cyclist is in the serenity of an early sunset evening the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half
you can use the computer to lock up your subject and a different websites will come speed quick to your screen
this made me very unhealthy i gained nine pounds in one week
if you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they need those kinds of books for
the last mood i thought was happy
i think that computers are becoming an issue
i would want it to be read seen and heard
computers are not good toward society
says a local mother as she talks about a computer game
this is important to because i am not very well organized when it comes to school
books magazines news papers and music are a great passing time
they also gave educational games
great masterpiece and rare books are sold at concessional rates
websites like  or  or  are scary when it comes to privacy
you can easily find the details and information you need
more people should see computers as a positive effect on people
it is the people around you causing the offensive news
to me censorship laws in libraries are not needed
they would rather go on the computer
will keep them from that anyway
ends the article with a very inspirational quote
so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music
because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip
this expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are called family
while the first few weeks in school he is picked on and made fun of
the censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching
it is telling us of his childhood
a person that come in the library daily want to read that book because that is the type of books that the man likes
books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning
whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today
first he described his childhood home
one reason i am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology
and about music
do you like learning about faraway exotic land and animals
without computers everything would be so much harder
some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short rolling hills
most of the housewives observe it and they don’t like to kill rats
we were just her about an hour ago but you want to know the funny reason we are back
another way to communicate is by video chat
there are millions of book in the world that people find offensive
i can think of several books that i would not want a child of mine to pick up and read
then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will return to take the test again
computers are not that bad
most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet
i have to disagree though
the many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways
as you can see the features of the setting affect the cyclist
computers can and will take away family and friend time
second are many solutions to try out before taking an item away
there are many beautiful flowers in our garden
they both have some of the same characteristics like chatting to your friends updating your status every now and then uploading pictures songs etc
for example flat roads was replaced by short rolling hills
the author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to highlight the theme and symbolize a new start
there are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist
he finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink
these are the items that teach us new things everyday
dear local  people have been using computers for years
another way is to have an adult monitor what the child gets from the library
if a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done
this put him at a great risk for dehydration which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten
everybody is different and what offends my neighbor not offend me
its like he forgot we were even the reason why i think computes should be in the state of 
you cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes
email allows you to do the same as text but you can write longer messages
go read a book to find out
for example say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting
people take pity on them and give them something
second i would like to talk about some of the books libraries have
what is this world coming to
beautiful flowers around their neck
short story about  leo tolstoy the great russian author
life in itself can be an opinion
the author shows the love of his culture home and family
answered with yes
libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them
if anything happened to him there is no one to help
when someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people
magazines are stocked on shelves in stores and on the front will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself
the responsibility should not be put on the librarians but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material
it  you have realized that computers do benefit people
i ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns
they allow easier research i can learn about other countries and can talk to people online
they should be replaced with educational things
parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing
people need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever
then he talks about his house and about how he had he had his birthday there
i stand by my opinion and believe offensive books magazines and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries
milk is taken from the cows the milk is also taken from sheep and goats
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
that is what i think the mood of this memoir is
books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that
in other words is that computer help a lot of people
he just sit in front of his computer and do nothing
i have an opinion about this and it might not effect everyone in the world but i do hope so
violence is very harmful for children
he is explaining his past
the hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope
in addition computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily
also in this memoir the mood is shown by gratefulness by the line i will always be grateful to my parents
some of that material is bad though but some is good
ask yourself is it right
there were vendors selling balloons caps eatables and lot of other things
to whom it concern i think computers have a great effect on people
this also adds a cozy feel to the environment
any isle of books was open to anyone i felt that i had the world in the palm of my hand
computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other more important matters
if he chooses not to that is up to 
the two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring
this part of his journey affects him the most
this was the first obstacle which affected him
all in all censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really
people have opinions people disagree
you can talk to relatives friends or anyone you want to talk to
she has set a goal to accept it
fine something unless to read about
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story
i know more than kids that have glasses now i also know that over parents i know now have glasses for the same exact reason
also he says at some point tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
so computers do have a positive effect on people
because libraries are public they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves
although we are becoming a smarter species we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world
second people can interact with family and friends online
more than half of or benefit just from working on the computers
the summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist
she said shell retake her driving test when her plant buds and is brave so she will do the same
at the least libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree
to most cultures declining food is offensive
whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devils offspring our youth need influences
after failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland
the flower faces many dangers but still manages to blossom
it not even be your friend
i have reason it build skills fast information and fun
online chat especially has an effect on most people because were trading in a fun day for one where we just talk online and back internet
poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced
i have met a obese child
in my conclusion about this article
if they hurt your feelings then you know not to read listen or watch it again
besides many of the things that people should be censored is probably not that bad
the best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves
these are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for
also if you sit on a chair all day honestly what will happen to you
for example computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily
yes the cons can be annoying  sometimes serious
it is also used to run trains from one place to the other
computers not only help people in school but at home too
the books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life
that has yet to become the problem
you fine out how old is or how tall is 
some of you ask  about at school
every parent and family is different as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries
censorship violates freedom of being different
last computers are a waste of time money and effort
how do they learn from computers
also in paragraph it says
this one reason why many people use computer
if they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read
they need to make a living on the street
you need a good grade on a project
teens who are going to be immature about it does not deserve to have all those things
computers have a positive effect on people
kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all
somethings people find offensive others might enjoy
the libraries and the community have choices to not have a offensive book on the self
maybe a near death experience causes someone to write a book
said our health teacher
some people are overweight because they eat and then do not exercise after
you can talk to people online with instant message it is a lot more dependable than a telephone or cell phones
censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history books or newspaper articles
some people go to a library to use the computer for a project or to check out books musical materials movies etc
finally jobs can be completed even easier and makes workers more responsible
you would probably agree that communication can be used in negative ways but communication is keep our world spinning
he creates a setting that many people can relate to because of the general feel of family and heritage
for example the cyclist reaches and fish camp he is able to hydrate once again
it seems that the time of research is diminishing
even if your just happens in you can keep in touch through email
and car are ran off of computers
in fact almost say they spend more time on the computer than anywhere else
money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture
i think that it is bad enough that a lot of teenagers have been exposed to a lot of these things already
in conclusion there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials
family lives quite a distance away well some friends and getting out of touch is a possibility
authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public
in fact even the internet has books to buy and read
the fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned
if you are religious you should have the right to be able to read what you want
well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a 
does that sound fair to you
many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years or even days of sitting in front of their computer they become lazy
the internet can be useful in everyday life
movies are rated by the language and content they have in it
all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today
we know this was the case for the cyclist because he says but not before i gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth
then what we will be able to read or listen too
then in paragraph  the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal
but if a book talks about certain things it should be banned such as hate against other races or it talks negatively about someones religion
the camels from arabia have one hump
libraries have all kinds of books
my second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades
that whole paragraph really gave me a good feeling and i could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the festivities
first off the mood starts with being friendly
computers are a bad habit even though we might need them its better safe then sorry to do it the old fashion way
there are certain ways to research information effectively
  things start to change hits changing terrain
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind
there was no sign of civilization what so ever
i think that computers have a positive effect on people
there are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist
on the internet alone you can view your school textbook
they are more of a benefit than a burden
the author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers
wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush resulting in a bad grade
parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching or rated movies
it should not happen any book movie magazine should be available to who wants it
reduced stress trading to confidence effect on society
if a person finds a book for example to be offensive they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one
his neighborhood was united and hardworking
first our parents read us books to get us to go to sleep
reading it i felt that i was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates
you can become obese for reasons
for example your friend live the other side of the globe you an your computer and message so you can still talk to them all the time
dear newspaper i believe that advances in technology have many positive effects such as computers
instead going to the store to buy things or walking to your friends house to talk you would typically use the computer to do so
now more families only spend time with each other when they eat dinner together
that is why i believe she wanted to conclude her story this way
when these people see you on the computer kind of example does it set
now that you have finished reading
most libraries are organized into sections for children young adults and adults
another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is children
this way of communication prevents children from learning valuable social skills which come with conversing face to face
this is why the computer supports our society
now i consider myself a young adult and i believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong
who can say where it should stop
all ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer and with some materials that is not possible
unable to bear the smoke i moved away fast
at this point the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable
i know i would like to
would you be hurt and taken back
passing on from people to kids to their kids
this would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was
my second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries
i think the libraries should be broken onto sections
the features of no buildings no people and no cars affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water
his gratitude is being showed towards his parents
a snake charmer is a common sight to indian villages
when you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around
of hospitals nationwide say that computers are on essential in their facilities
i think that people need to step away from the computer desk get good grades avoid bullying and criminals
computers should be known as our friends
outside there is great things to do like go to the park or play sports
do you have family members who live far away from you
this is my point of view on things
so since you are not working out and your mind is always on the computer you can get sick
during summers he grows rice cotton and jute
the author in this memoir created a mood that showed how felt about this house and his parents
this gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since hes traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high
he also mentions how grateful he was to have a caring and loving family to be brought up in
she means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time
there won be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen
mentally she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know
or i get an answer to a question
some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but i disagree
has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book
its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die while most of us do nothing to help
another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time
if someone came across that in a book it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book
but it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride
did you know that of children are obese at young a young age
these social networking allow teens to talk with there friends
this is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media
then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school
just make a new section for it
they were able to catch the man
the association of reported that in of used a website and of them were in good positions
this fact is quite amazing because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time
if you do theirs something wrong with you
you can tell a friend that you cant it to there party
taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else
the setting of a desert in the uncultured
having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad censorship
the cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down
the only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer
most of the questioning about a book is the language in it
the people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away
she was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow
we need to leave every book on the shelves
they gave up their families friends country and careers all for their son so he could live a better life in the 
chatting is the number one thing kids adults  and teenagers do
no matter the age they are
no worries the person no contact you by a simple email
we are a middle class family and my home also belongs to the family background
kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered
but why do some people not hire them
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very sad loving caring
there is a time when i went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout that had an impact on colored people
they even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school
what should be done about the books movies magazines and movies that are offensive to some of the people
no matter what type of book it is it still tells us a story of another place and another time
dear   computers
being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts
this made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him
libraries can not censor their materials
now we have violence
i think also if a young child or teenager cant see read or hear those types of things than they should not be in there period
going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay
last but not least when you have nothing else to do you can play games and watch videos from online
you would get addicted to being on the computer all the time
he fights for his country and people
these people brain wash people convince them to meet and rape and kill them
in my experience as a computer engineer
show just look online you will find it
another reason why is that a school project or essay
the reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and need it for something they are doing
just like parents librarians will try to find an educational book that the child enjoy
but every town the cyclist came to was deserted
now that are new technology with computers and such people are distracted and do not want to exercise
these days it is very popular
this was a huge achievement for the 
we can now shop cloths and other household items
for example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much
in conclusion people spend to much time on their computers
computers messes up kids grades
this is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue
if people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere
the computer should be used to talk to family and friends homework research work and you bored play some games little games on the computer
this was true in the censorship of  as well
people stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons
they have a pair of eyes and a pointed beak
did you know that obesity has gone up since last year
she puts in examples from the story that could help find these reasons
or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out
you can go on the internet and find out how they live there
some features of the setting affected the cyclist
some such as playing sports
in this time i hope you have learned more about the computer and have changed your mind
second computers help people communicate with others
most important a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what some one looks up checks out or even says
she flirted with him on and on day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really and a pervert
and get a college education without leaving your home
out come the sun shades umbrellas and cotton clothes
she feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test
i do not enjoy books that do not have drugs alcohol family stress war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring
dear  minute of the day  millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops but is it always a good thing
relative means that one person has a different view than that of another
more time spent on or anywhere on the means less time studying which means lower grades
i was thinking to myself that oh well i am young and i will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad
there are many great things about computers
as soon as the recess bell goes students rush out of their classrooms
second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then
being an adult one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and the judge of what they are going to let their children watch
as a result many are suffering from various physical and mental disorders
each day more kids are getting addicted to the computer
its just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes
life is filled with mixed society and emotions so not everyone will agree on the same thing
my second reason is that even though computers are often thought of as destroying  can build social lives
they both could have good ideas and functions to them
that is the mood the memoir set of me to understand it
there are certain sights like and where we can interact with other people
over of the sites used by teens are based on networking
these two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times then it was taken away
students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers not there
well they should know that it can harm there kids and it can also teach there young kids bad stuff
dear local newspaper more and more people are using computers there days
this affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park
we can learn that are going on from far away
the is one of the greatest countries ever to exist yet we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives
if the books or magazine would start being taken off the selves then we would have less ways to research or learn certain things
secondly computers have a positive affect on people because it saves people time by shopping online
the novel   is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme
where would we be without those books and authors
an ideal citizen does not cheat the government
computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently
in my own opinion its a good thing
censorship in libraries is not as needed as most people think
also teaches you homework that you did
in fact of all the people in this who owns a  is addicted to computers
i mean what do you think
i would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie
people get called names all the time
you would just sit there looking at the computer all day
we learn information about the world and about what is going on
soon though the terrain changed
for example  be there very own website
also hes running out of water and becoming dehydrated
if any book is subject to criticism or opposition are not all books worthy of the same
he starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain
it gave me a gigantic
my second reason for being is that it can help teach said and life skills
and all those websites can help 
many people assume that computers are just for entertainment to play games and have fun on your free time
in public libraries i think there should be sections of books based on age level which most libraries do have already
suddenly it started raining
i thoroughly believe they are mistaken
also their weight breaks down and ruins roads which in turn cost more tax money
kids are kids
nature used to be the most peaceful think now it the internet
these magazines and books could also be seen as informing
if more people had computers then they would the to questions
we should not have this right because it would not be fair to any one
the mood created the author in the memoir was grateful and loving
the strong heat because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke
the ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased
to wrap it all up the mood the author created in the memoir was about love and happiness
another example is paragraph ten
it refreshes the mind
disks and listen to music and watch filmswhen you use a
traveling by bus in an enjoyable experience and i prefer traveling by my car
i remember when my friend and i were years old she started reading books with offensive words and her mom got mad at her
all of us are different and we like different things but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own
dear local newspaper i have herd that some people do not agree that computer benefit our society
the ending is a cliff hanger to show that her story has not yet completely ended
one way is is shown when mentions his grand parents
when you limit the themes of books in your library some kids just pick up less and less books as time goes by
whatever the user wants is a text and a click away
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
nobody should be able to tell you to get off the computer because that is your choice in life
internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away
without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman
by tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right what will come next
they believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying
also helps kids like to find information for reports and
let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler
according to my prior knowledge i know certain materials will affect different people in different ways
the thing about these is they are displayed in different ways such as music
even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic it will still remain a topic of much debate
the mood of this memoir to me is comforting
the setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake
but not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination
in the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it
my name is and i think computers are not bad
many people like computers and have one
a book on be inappropriate in the eyes of a  but that book be sacred to a 
that was the sound of a light bulb going off in your head
but are they getting used to much
the author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together
out computer users have used calculator to help them solve a problem
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
about how his parents was so selfless and would always lend a hand to anybody needed help matter who they were
the majority of movies and books have relevant information portray events that could take or have taken place and teach valuable lessons
the author created a very positive and optimistic mood in the memoir
young children are often daily visitors of the library
another good thing that you could play games with your friends like all types shooting games racing sport arcade all type
what so you think about this
cousin lives in and the only way i can ever talk to him is through a computer
why would you move from the shelves if they are going to know about it some how
my mother  father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge of the language or the culture
i mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them
having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers readers listeners etc
the example is saying how the plant was almost died when she bought it
many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly
they can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look
or have you ever wondered or said to your self any of these statements
i believe using a computer is part of you healthy choices and you can lean a lot more than you really think you can
kidnappings are caused because to much information on the internet do you want that for your child
the answer is no
one song that i just saw was called 
dear local news paper i think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age
she wont give up but try again later on in the year
but computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them
furthermore a book contain images not suitable for children
being with your family is important because their fun go out with
not to mention the career paths involving computers directly such as repairing or movie special effects
dreadful humble time conservative computers are taking away the meaning and enjoyments life that are offered to us
these technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends
we do not need things like that in our world
it can be and very offensive
thus if he ever reaches the next town
that is because they would start looking at it more
i wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer
if every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book libraries would have to close because no books would be left
but what if there was  computer
just have to remember whats important to someone and help keep an eye out with them
the internet makes that research very easy as you access to any time
on the other hand it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent
i have had a select few instances throughout my life where i have read a book or magazine that to some seem offensive and to others not at all
what if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow
others not but they still will be able to see them in there own way
also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him
well i refuse to let it set into my mind and i hope you choose the same for yourself
the narration says not like the kind we had 
the computer also helps you to learn
for one there are many sites out there that portray false information
in the story rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways
you can almost search anything on the computer
music is passion to most people
what you see or read can really have an affect on you
once when i was in a library i was offended by a book title that was against my religion
since they want it more they will find away to do watch or listen to what ever it be
failing a test especially a driving test stinks
learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life
are living a modern time society is advancing everyday and computers are a huge part of it
librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries
and because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium there should never be a limit on these rights
also a computer can help you with your education
maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism
theirs always something to do or a place to go
this is an easy way to get around the system
a censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library
so i figured out the hard way
you should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at
to me that sounds like something with a positive effect would you say
go on a walk or a bike ride or walk your dog while riding a bike
this is affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends
it is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer
also to be able to learn about faraway places will help in school
they only way that i feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material
this can have a very negative affect
another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out
it causes violence among people
in conclusion computers impact proper in many positive ways
parents should modify what their children watch but as an adult they are able to watch or read anything that they want to
so which one are you going to listen to
if the whole community disagree with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it
it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them
i intend growing plants of flowers
this is a very interesting quote
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come
computers allow people to learn they allow people communicate to family and friends too
many people could take music in the wrong way
it is now or never you would never know if you can be that man in the hospital with that cancer
some books in libraries offend others
also the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink and not die from dehydration
this time she made an excuse but how many times is she going to make up an excuse
it has been discussed by many people but a decision has never been reached
but after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her
in the memoir the author creates a loving mood
computers also give us the ability to research places and things we never get the opportunity to see in person
no we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves
just use the technology at your hands responsibly
not being with the people you love not doing any activities you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life for
so read on to hear more
so in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things
i will collect small things nearby and will build a nest a top of a tree
these works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor
she was depressed and homesick
just yesterday i had to type up a response a free writing choice and an entry for a history project
but this is what i think is right
a third way the author sets the mood is by speaking so fondly of their parents
kids find these books movies and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books
and will forever be an on growing matter in problems around the 
this is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries
you could censorship the books and hide them from the public but that would cause another problem
with computers you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them
about of children are more attached to colorful objects than books with words in them
this taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money
someone never give up and do what he wishes to do
the computer is a good way to contact family and friend
an example i have of is my baby sister
this sets the mood of being grateful throughout the story
computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives
almost every library is very organized into categories
the landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water
which if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you
any question you can be asked on the internet and you will get an answer
there was a rather large snake in his path
computers would be easier for you to collect research than a book
many record keeping systems are switching to computers now
books magazines movies music etc
the desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one
thanks for your time on reading why i think computers are a big problem here in the 
lastly computers let us talk to other people online
the terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut
 ore and more people use computers  but this is not necessarily a good thing
 electronics expert
it is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads
in all of my years i have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library
also with so many computers it creates jobs
i would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication
the story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing so the author wanted to end with message of hope
i believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do
as a child my sister grew up with computers she knew how to fully use it by age  she went to collage with amazing computer skills
reduced social interacting and skills also result
she buys it and takes it home in a pot
this document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive
also there are many people that find the offensive
the marketplace is always crowded
people have the right to say how they feel by any medium
and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book
when that happened stopped using the computer and went back to basketball
i am in grade at mystic middle school
the things i and many others believe should be censored are profanity violence and offensiveness toward race religion and gender
we look different and see things different
some books teaches them about the world they are growing up in
other then that i think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past
the internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to
keep reading for more information
computers are used by many people to interact with another
so the cyclist was happy and strong
however some movies are okay for some people and their age
where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible
out of students that they spend more time indoors than out
people should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time
these are some of the things authors want to avoid
therefore i do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries
we need knowledge to make the most out of it
last you 
it is illegal to censor any publication such as books magazines music or movies
heat dessert humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey
this describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up
first rolling hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end
items like that should be sold in a separate store
without it his family would wonder how he was and be worried
we all at some point have seen or learned of naughty magazines like playboy
throughout this memoir the author creates moods whether good or bad of the memories of his childhood
all materials in a library are for the public
also people are able to communicate online
music is like a drug to me and i am addicted
you can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in 
would you want to live in a world like that
thank you for time
for example i read a very famous book called the of by 
so my answer is no about taking things away that are not censored
when you have friendship home and love everything will be perfect for you
the sea helps all forms of life on earth
in conclusion all of this can only be done with a computer
you cant him them from it either its an on going battle that will never be one and it will keep getting worse
all they do is sit down eat on unhealthy snack and play games and videos
now since i am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things
you would think that your going to hang out with them later
to start off as an eight grades we are prepared to go to high school
she has grown to her environment like a flower
very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other
because you are on the machine all day then you are using little to no energy at all
nobody is forcing you to view it but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it
it is their freedom to do whatever they want
computers can improve learning in a variety of ways
they are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible
furthermore scientists suspect humans are now a major cause of global warming
there are many reason i feel this way and i hope that after people have read this they will agree with me
i do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf
just as in basketball when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it
they sit in groups of three or four
the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf
one of the books we had to find was the 
even though certain books offend people i think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf
the book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished
censorship can have good and bad qualities
if not then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit
the mood in this story is very happy
computers are great they can help you with anything you need
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision
this however is not acceptable
this is because everyone from the most to the least intelligent people have their opinions ideas and hard facts in a computer on the web
thank you for taking the time to read this
these reasons are knowledge different sections of the library and freedom
they also allow people to talk to other people online
but they would never say anything to the library cause they know that i will be hearing these words all the time when i get older
dear local newspaper it has came to attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad affect on those who use them
so go get yourself a computer and amazed
and even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions
so take my opinion into consideration
while some books are censored because of shame some are censored because a certain group of people find it offensive
you can not please everyone so in that case censorship will just have to be looked beyond
for example if you we addicted to computers then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life
if a certain artist or actor is offensive to them they should find something else and leave that or movie for someone else to enjoy
if there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future
most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for 
there are also websites called online databases on the internet
children should be kept away from these books but they should not be completely removed from the shelves
the computer does effect how people exercise i know what you are
they will get addicted to the computer
i rushed over to her and put her back to sleep
you have an opportunity to learn about things you like
they have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection
the internet also allows you to learn about certain subject or events you might not have a book for
i do agree with this because with our countries of obesity
not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic the information could very well be false
anything put onto paper is legal
even government allows many concessions and grants for educational tours
lastly computer make things easier and have images on 
the ride on the hills and through the desert also tire him out dramatically
the is all people use to write on their paper and doodle on the back round
she is entitled to them
libraries are almost in every town
it was july the schools had reopened
books as well kids have very imaginative minds they not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for
everyone i hangout with is not in to freaky novels
in conclusion if you find a movie song book article or magazine that is offensive to you get over it
i hope you think the same too
it was sad but we promised to stay in touch
as evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting
works of literature are just one of them
mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to
they teach new things
she is taking it to prove to herself no one else
sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about
did you lash out or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding
in exercising while making on 
my mom never bothered to answer that question but if she did she would make up some story
a computer is a huge technological advancement with many uses
when the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination
almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another
there are countless sites and to name a few    the list goes on and on
people can also use computers to type and save paper
in many ways both advancing technology or not why be inside doing nothing but talking to people
there are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves
people are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk
allowing us to communicate to one another without us leaving the safety of our homes
her mother was very understanding and accepted it
its not health
you simply cannot please everyone
this section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there
they are a great blessing
i feel very strongly about my statement because everyone in this world is different
dear newspaper percents of jobs day use computers
helping that child find what they want a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child
in that situation i would just go on computer and a friend asking them for the assignment
i support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people
last example is if your teacher says find the book about the and you go to the library but everyone is taken but you have one by tomorrow
you can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people
just pay attention to whats going on in the library
that means that it is open to anyone and everyone
laptops make work possible on the go to
in some ways censorship is necessary and in other ways some people just want attention
some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free
they censor you
this led him through the desert
well you can shop online
people are saying that computers have a negative effect on people
that is how even came to be
thank you for reading this article
these are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries
someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves just because it be offensive to them or there way of life
it will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch
i am proud of my dream
some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries
this is simply untrue
the cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to park
computers are they lot us chat with friends and family
it was a flat land than rolling hills
what would you do
they have so much information that if you were to go to the library you would be there all day
it would empty
my first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer
since my schedule is so busy after school
that is only one of the reasons i think computers are beneficial to society
something that is offensive to one person or a group of people not be found offensive by another person or group of people
another reason is to express the theme
i will give attention to discipline
taking materials out of a library i would have to disagree
that sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else
no matter how offensive the topic is
if we silence the author and there story or song how will we be able to view life in another persons view
dear local news paper computers is a good idea because every developed country uses computers
those are lives that could have been saved families that could still be together
computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more
each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe
so friends save trees by not cutting them and make them happy
this is because they are able to look so definitions faster research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips
in a time of pain all you want is a friend
the world wide web unlimited socialization and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers
in the spring she will have a piece of her homeland blooming and she will be warm again
this creates a loving and family mood
to take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it
also computers let you learn a lot about history
censorship is affecting society ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away
another reason why computers are good to use is because of online chats
others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves the shelves would be nearly empty
if you have ever been to a bookstore or library you how hard it is to find the book your looking for
she was able to make a connection with the plant
the cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map
when a student forgets the homework they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night
he is very good in studies
but i believe that the main purpose for computers is information
also they wont be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone
if things offend you how would the next person learn
i also know computers can or will help people all around the world
children that are not in school or in the early stages of school
finally the computer is a great way to communicate online
a recent study shows that out of families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time
smell nice out to day
the music you listen to has a huge impact on your life
individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room
i am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries
my guess not much
furthermore computers can be very distracting to many people
also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions
different perspectives come from different people young old parents and children
that material is the life blood of our society
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in
the last kind of books i think is offensive is books because they are hard to read them in 
i will remind you of the three reason why this is true
honestly in my eyes its simple if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it because others enjoy it
this helps the children stay there and not wonder off into one of the adult or teen sections
so nothing should be banned and just keep it and everything will still be the same
there was water everywhere
another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from
offensive books should be there to only distract the teenager from school
also you feel that there is nothing you can do to fix it
if a child read something about sex he or she might be curious or confused and ask their parents about it
there are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout
i think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him
she is very cute
computers learning by let vast of information being available
i believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people
he ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike
you can become obese
overall our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music
people use messaging and its also a way getting connected to others
she should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do
the thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together
for example a person be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on
also you are pushing your loved ones away by being on 
i could finish my homework in minutes compared to hours
computers are needed in this day and age or else some people would not be able to survive without them
most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends
the second day of this festival is a special day
dear newspaper i think computers are good for you because talk online teach hand eye coordination and other stuff too
everything is normal again and we go to check out
had a earthquake we went on websites for that
this is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did
this really cannot be helped
and if we got rid of all the more mature books what kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read
this is all because technology was invented
the offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there
your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body besides the vital parts
spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease
when the geese get back
computers are enjoyable great pieces of technology
in conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more
a computers chat you to reconnect with old friends and make new ones
it will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them
so he gets on a bike and rides to the next town
this is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another
dear  i believe many people spend to much time on computers
the computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple
in our everyday lives we come across many things that can be taken to offense
some parents censor what their kids read and watchand some do not
personally in my opinion i have no problem with anything found in libraries today
instead libraries should be divided into sections based on topics
drew  a park ranger says
i had just joined middle school
for example when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills
many say that ignorance is bliss but is it really when people impose their ideas on others
if books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already
computers help educate the minds of people and without them we might not know anything
then their problem is solved
so the past no longer haunts them
kids can use this as samplemodel essay and write your own essay
she said when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
well i think so
i live in a small town near longford in london
i am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers
i think that computer help in many different ways
you just have to find a way that benefits you most
last we get to talk to people online in these next paragraphs ill share my thoughts about this topic to you
when you need information on the line
their are better things to 
some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind
certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason
during his lifetime was ruled by kings so if he wanted to be successful he had to appease the 
some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries
that is my last reason my opinion is what it is
the mood of this article is very loving and kind
culture would slowly wither and die and our lives would become drab and essentially useless for lack of a better term
please take this info your next 
computers are an essential learning tool for school system today
i would be grateful also
first you get a head ache then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy
and lastly do you want your put in danger by simply just using a at home
if the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water
there family is happy
some people think it is a good idea and same do not
people do not exercise enough strain their eyes and have less interaction with real people
what is a government for
i do not want to be the same as everybody else
like in the movie they are beating up and killing people just because they are colored
libraries need to be kid friendly places so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer
not only those but people are still interacting with others
i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway without paying a fortune in money to go the 
personal life is restricted to certain rules and criteria
but now you can find anything almost anywhere
also once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again
do you want to relax and do something fun after 
he learned with his family how to love others and how to respect
and she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter she knows that she will not fail either
also a lot of people are using the for there businesses
therefore you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country
if the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding
they look for knowledge and taking away a persons learning capacity can be harmful to everyone
i do not agree
right computers bring people together whether its friends families or relatives from far countries
if you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad
the parents turned a simple house into a home
if one wishes to learn about how to murder in a then i think they should be aloud to do so
when she says
the mood created in the memoir is a happy and caring and also sometimes sad
big public awareness programs should be organized to teach the public about the value of water
the more hills the more energy lost the more tired he became
but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town
when he leaves the factory he feels 
now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive
it was starting to become daylight and he had to walk miles to get to the next town
computers are fun for many different reasons
the use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented
allowing the reader watcher or listener to expect more and want more
furthermore people are wasting their important attention
i miss my garden when i am in kuwait
my reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers less time exercising and lose interacting with family and friends
one way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages
a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature
this means that books magazines movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive
one example is that people that stay on the computer wont have much fun on other people
sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game  sure in some ways it is
that is why people use computer for research
have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next
many people have different views and opinions on things
one essential right that every man woman or child should have is the freedom of speech
to begin with seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate on the computer there is many ways
daily exercise while having fun beats just having fun on a computer
for an example who is harry 
no i do not believe that libraries should censor anything
a can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science
the situation would have been different if it were anywhere else
the features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist
the mood makes me think of the color yellow and of the sun happiness and warmth
i have read some books outside of my school library that i think should not be found on a library shelf
dear  i am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society
censorship in libraries should not be allowed
in no way shape or form is this morally correct
a third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people
a library is safe haven
it gave him that extra boost of energy that seems to have come out of nowhere
two pedals and a bell are also part of it
now i regret not getting together with her to hang out
books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years
these are all things that should not be allowed to access on a computer
also the computer can teach you lots of thing
next computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world
overall this memoir had a very positive and happy mood
for example a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man but a black man would consider it to be about his history
the person could go out and see friends and family
one way is interacting with different people all over the world
they sacrificed their needs and wants for their children
she said i needed parent consent before i was able to check it out
computers are the future and have even proven to save lives
it seems today we attempt to censor everything but are we going too far
people think that computers are only used for games but in reality they teach us things about the world
dear newspaper or to whom this article concern
since music is categorized in such a way there should be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library
games are great to get your mind going
you guessed it computers
if someone reads them as offensive they might just be taking it the wrong way
all you gotta do is talk to them online
i was doing a water depleting 
this memoir is indeed heart warming and touching though it is very inspirational
in conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired hot and thirsty which affects his entire journey
experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is tacking away time from you being able to interacting with family members and friends
the cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years
we are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see but we can start to eliminate some of them
computer are also helpful for applying for like you can look for you like
they want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home
one the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker
they are either working or playing
music is an outlet for many people
school libraries are a whole different idea
but why should we remove books magazines movies etc from shelves
whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs values or customs
just about any domain name on the web
everyone in the twenty first century uses a computer
computers are everywhere these days even in the poorest places like 
but a lot of people use computers almost everyday
that mood was replaced by short moving hills
the right to remove a book off of a shelf is not good thing to do
some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults
the geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day
it allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally
i feel that certain materials that young people see in books music and movies are at the library
it represents a hopeful tone and symbols that relate to spring
the setting can affect anything
tennis baseball basketball hockey etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination
instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips children should be outside on their bikes or swimming or playing sports with their friends
since he cant find water he has to conserve what he has
the narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope challenge physical pain despair and relief
lastly i think the computer has a negative effect because it them
he keeps the books in proper order
what if you live far away from the nearest library
you can even chat online with friends or maybe find long lost friends
my last reason is that people are not
maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is
them to talk
i believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what
she realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment and that that is what makes a great strong individual
i hope you read this with my regards
dear staff are computers helpful to us regularly
every human being does not have the same taste in what they read listen to look at and watch
i think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination
giving strangers you information they can trace you down and find the street you live on
libraries are supposed to be for all ages
in conclusion people might say that taking out book is better than keeping them
or maybe you have a history report due the next day and your parents can drive you to the library
video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest
but its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it
you can use this to talk to friends and many on line
other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to
i was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like swimsuit magazines and many more
the library is a place for peace and quiet so headphones are necessary regardless
it saves gas money and time
books always have reviews so people can tell if those are too or not
in history many things are considered offensive
hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more
imagine my joy of rowing for almost ten minutes
we all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries
when i was a child i picked up on everything
everyone just pushes and jostles
this shows how much love the author has to be grateful for
finally computers can be very dangerous
sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people
the author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes
think about paying somebody to count your taxes year after year when you can save a fortune and do it yourself
i agree so because one it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world
this shows his love for his kitchen
he has a small family
the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist
these so called computers are causing this why look over there
 the mood shows admiration towards his parents
while can be debated that computers are bad i firmly disagree
offensive material to one person might be what another person wants or needs to read whether for recreation or class
that is a job for a computer
they should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books magazines or movies
and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing
parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read
if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it
at the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books
i was able to let them know a matter of seconds
it also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away
the author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story
life without newspaper is difficult to imagine
this providing stories for all and protecting small children from magazines such as 
of course her and exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that and she moved on with her life
of students wait till last minute to do their reports on average they spend over four hours on the computer
many more things that offend people are always going to be there
so why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom
the ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies
he was beginning to lose hope
i just think that people should write for the pure joy of it not to persuade people to do something bador give bad thoughts or ideas
but with determinationyou can accomplish anything
the internet has over millions of websites for many reasons
there are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see
did you ever turned on your 
why should information and knowledge be with held from people
first of all in the story it says and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke 
there a lot to say about the music out there
now that i have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience
anyone can write and post an article on the internet even if what they are saying is not true at all
it can be fun chatting educational or hard working
there was no mishap on the way
luckily i was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic just by typing the keyword
some people need computers for their 
a song book or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended
company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the one ever
if a parent does this to their child it just sheltering them from the world around them
that is one of the beauties of being an citizen freedom of speech
i understand that parents want to protect children
please read on to read in detail as to why i feel this way
the issue is people was to much time on computer
these technological devices have enabled to us to get our work done in a timely matter to receive the grade that we deserve
does somebody hand write every paper that comes out
she kept say how much she was thankful for having such great parents and a great house
computers have benefited society in many ways
once you have finished researching it is easy to type your report
in a library only certain things should be done
in paragraph  he also shows how life with his family was
books give us the inspiration to do great things
a computer can help you do many things could help you learn chat with friends and can entertain you
are diabetic which means we are not at a safe health rate
the mood also sounds very loving because he loves his parents for moving to 
this boy was jim who had been running away from master
finally strength is the last why the author chose the paragraph to end the story
my favorite place to go is northern in 
a person is a human being
we used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics
after a long day at school teens go from the bus to the front door to their computer chair

he tells me that his on a line hooking up with other people
they help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about
according to  or have a website which can be accessed over the computer
another thing that needs to be removed is racial material
you can play games with people
they should ignore it and find something else of interest to them
the hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water
they are known to be friendly and intelligent by nature
this problem could easily be avoided if needed
we see a rainbow only when there is sunlight and rain at the
books can be learning in many ways
most children are addicted to computer games
i also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests then they should just not look at it
sometimes those books can get into the wrong hands and end up in the trash or burned
so i decided to stop
the library could put those certain books in own part of the library
is usually online
people could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library
although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned it would be quite difficult to accomplish
along with books many movies and magazines are also being taken off of the shelves because of offensive material
each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place
but the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video
when that happens all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips
secretly left his house and went because he was curious
i know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games
lastly the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students
when she returned to england she set up a training college for nurses
dear local newspaper  i am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people
they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong
but the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it
the parrot is quick in coping with what others say
this could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library
i say this his family always let people from the neighbor hood come over and they were like family
for example once my friend  was planning on going to for a business trip but had no idea how to speak the language
certain readings and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one
the author concluded the story with that because she is saying that when the year starts off and starts over that she will too
if one removes these from society in any form then at a raw standpoint they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society
all of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest
this agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions computers and phones
she thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year
movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content
this is the mood the author created in his memoir
it is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination
the drainage system was choked
in that case why censor certain things that people are interested in or even things to research in libraries
spring has a healthy effect on the body
computers are good for school uses skills and just for fun
having family come live with you till they get back on their feet
i have chosen this ambition with confidence and after a lot of thinking
i think computers are a great way to have fun
he talks about how his parents had to start over again with their lives to come to 
when the spring comes she will bud with the flower and take the test again
the tone adds to the theme of the story
this excerpt conveys a feeling of nostalgia and warmth as the author praises his childhood home
so the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat
you could learn about other places in the world
some people like to come in the library to relax and look at a magazine or listen to some music
whenever i go into  my page comes up and shows me the current events
it has a big effect on a humans life
some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them
another issue too much computer time can cause  are even more health issues
this is what i think the authors mood is in the memoir
then people would understand that everyone is different in their own way and not everyone will enjoy what they do
we should always give respect to our elders and teachers
the computer can help in many ways
which this means slow down or you will have an accident
also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles
this would be of good importance to me if you took my letter into
she will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country
a book that have been banned in the could not have been read by my mother or father
i chose this mood because in the memoir he describes how nice it was to live in a town where people cared for him
everything is not all bad it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it be
we people as a whole need to come together to make this happen
here the home is described even more as a part of the family less is a building
but they can do it in another way other than taking the book off the shelf
for example the earthquake in which
in the backyard there is a small vegetable garden
they allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks
books are an extremely important part of literature
music magazines books and movies
computers also help us stay in touch with our family members and friends
it shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it
she began failing classes
i obviously think that censorship is a good thing
the girl says that she is going to take the test again when the hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow
how many times has it been said that communication is key to a healthy relationship
in the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of 
the library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books
another factors is the maturity of the reader
everyone will have there own views about a book music movies or magazines
computers today are consuming our world
the best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else
thanks to computer also i learned that has one of the in the 
those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad
computers are every where in a schools homes band business across a 
removing certain materials from the library would not be in good interest
firstly computers are greatly changing the way people communicate
so if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn you can communicate with others and you learn responsibility
all activities came to a standstill
these are the moods the memoir created
the surroundings have little effect on him
the technology of computers has brought education to new
so yes take them away
instead of censoring items there is another solution
the technology takes very important time away from children and adults
but if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from
is very tasty
computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball football basketball or a gym
imagine playing baseball with a friend who lives miles away from you while still being a kid in  or set in your exercise adventure
there are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people
some of them are small some are big and some have fans on their head
furthermore you can play with your friends and in the process develops social skills
most modern day book movies music etc
we need water for drinking and bathing for cooking food and washing clothes and utensils
she was upset and afraid that her mother was going to be angry with her that she started to shake
i firmly believe that this is correct
they are constitutionally protected in the things they say
the features of the setting in rough road ahead negatively affect the cyclist
as creepy as it sound
however those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it
as i grew up in my younger years i hated the computer all i wanted to do was go outside and play
sure and a lot of others love their computers
his acquiring of knowledge by probing makes him supreme
this just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other
believes this is pulling her family apart
instant messaging is just like texting on your phone except much faster
also all he could do was a water depleting 
there should just be a limitation on who can view it
others just want to talk to other family or friend member in other towns states countries or continents
no matter what someone is always going to take offense to something
the people who do not find it offensive might actually want to read them
there would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive
dear  minute man people are complaining
work data and they help of businesses we file reports communicate with other branches of that company
adults and kids spend to much time on online pages
so what you choose pay over thirty dollars just for a long distance call or stay on the computer
one object such as a book a movie or a magazine can teach a person millions of lessons
why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive
could use it for related could use it for 
what is the first place you would go to talk to people online 
also it takes time enjoy nature but the computer blocking the way
in the long run all this talking over computers is going to hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job
before a person checks out a book or movie they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting
once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop
they should not remove the books completely they should just warn people of the language
just like that you know and off to you meeting
you can use computers for exercise then it is also up to the on limits
my misery came to an end
as the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused
please consider my reasons when making your decision
learn things on the computer but only virtually
the is writing in first person narrative
actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children
overall was happy about how his whole childhood when and it seemed like he loved every last minute of it
computers can affect the way people are and how they interact
the author concludes the story by showing the girls connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese the winter hibiscus is her connection to her homeland
with my wings i can fly above all the buildings in the city
a simple message though one of these websites will make someones day and could even make yours
it also make our work neater
technology advances people are opened up to many possibilities suck information via the web unlimited socialization and simulations
it can stop children from exercising enjoying the out doors and spending time with family
movies should be judged a little more carefully in my eyes because movies are like show and tell
a lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier
to do assignments for a job or school
but i know that i was traumatized
we all have it we just need to start using it
next using computers builds hand eye coordination as well
dear i think computer are one of the most inventions ever
computers help kids too
just because a person does not appreciate their child picking up a book they should not have
every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing
now you know what the computer can do to you
to answer the question bluntly no i do not think that media should be banned just because is offensive
lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world
he is also thank full for his culture
there can also be language that the kids should not read
computers and the were a technological break through
many parents go hiking camping swimming and lots of other stuff but they that anymore
but why should your values and beliefs dictate what another person can or cannot get from their library
but what cams this
the author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons
everyone has been teased once in their life
this memoir had one theme that meant many different things
everyone needs exercise
he said to me in no uncertain terms “young one never be sloppiesh
now we have the computer
i also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on 
it all right there together
plants and replant them in the field
another example was when my friend wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from
this quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding
also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for
i believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions
discover how great an impact computers can have on your life with just a click of the mouse
computers have truly played a vital role in our education
censorship is not good for any society
rated is want they our now letting children watch and buy 
today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that censorship
all over the universe people agree or disagree with what i have to say but its your perspective and what you think about it is your choice
computers are a great way to talk to someone
do children need to be protected for some things
everybody had their favorite movie song or book when they were younger
from my personal experience i have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books
our country has many problems but a few of them are the core values that are upheld in the 
but if the libraries have censored content in the library then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content
another thing about computers is that you can talk to your family members all the way in a different city town state or even content
truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth
computers can help you find your way
he takes a little rest and starts work again
its as simple as that
now on to more about using computer for homework
might of experienced something like this
first when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living
a second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research
their family  their job
people today are spoiled
due to their role the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible
he cant say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none
if you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it
he came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building
personally i think computers have a positive effect on people
however hope is renewed when he thinks of the cool pines and rushing rivers of 
the computer next to the  is probably the number one thing that makes people fat
computers have a large positive effect on our lifestyle
however she survived the brutal attack and deleted her account
if we take away one kind of music then we have to take away every kind of music
i agree that some things should not be displayed on shelves at libraries
periods like the holocaust the genocide of about six million by  would eventually die with the generations that knew about it
everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions
years ago people were able to function fine with out computers so we should be able to too
in school libraries the majority if not all of the library is devoted to children or teenagers
he says over and over that he loved his home when he was a kid and enjoyed hanging with his family
the violates the separation of church and state
with that being said i have come up with what i believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries
then you will love the 
i know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone
making purchases is fun though
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story do not exceed posted speed limit in many ways
first you meet how people or friends
aforementioned obesity is issue
losing one can be very sad
the next day i went to take my exam
the author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph
i wish they would not but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so
computers have allowed us to communicate with our family that live somewhere we cant afford to travel to
whether you see nothing around
being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing
she soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about
also they say that you can learn more about someone in minutes of playing with them then in minutes of talking with them
thank you for your time
it allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college
some do not believe that is an opinion
the possess of issuing the tickets restarted
in conclusion i think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad
computer are a direct cause to child obesity and they are a threat to society
the number of computers sold has gone up since 
most importantly i would like to tell you a story
with the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them
what if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff in a little writing
the breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down
i have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in   and etc
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated getting tired and by getting lost
i hate cheats and fairweather friends
another example is when it says tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me
he went to find a book to look at and i went to find a good book to read
an issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books movies music and magazines
people find something special in what they read that other people might not find
a kid grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it
one cyclist was coming in the opposite direction
i can say that books and songs have saved lives
a few months ago i was at the library
computers also let people learn about new things
once your power goes out you have noting to do because you got fired all because of you computer
there is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people
i think it is a positive thing for children to know about the past
computers take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it
he had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted
it is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world
or do they lose customers and stop giving the rights of freedom of speech
her gentle grandmother
second is your water supply
local research show that of planning their vocation use the internet
private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law
don’t hurt your dear ones even in your disturbed moments
lastly it helps you to interact with other students when not in school
reasons are that they can educate  they make things easy they are enjoyable
however to absorb you gain new knowledge be it of a new culture or new person
there is much to be learned in the way of psychology and human nature from almost any writing
finally my last reason why i think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot
dear  you think computers help society
imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then
you can contact the people there with computers
who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends
my last reason i think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs
for example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water
a library not be able to please everyone
yes being on the computer definitely has a bad side
in these types of games it costs money to bag upgrades buy towers
here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems
the effects of computers on me are very good
taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples knowledge of our world
that is exactly what i said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon
books that are found offensive are more interesting than just plain boring books
it also shows the importance of the hibiscus
as said by people from the state 
is one of the most popular chat groups on the internet is another popular chat group
i think that computers are good thing to have around
libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians
sometimes enjoying nature can be difficult but if we all look closer it can be really fun
looking up places in sometimes
computers offer another way to learn things about the world
that statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart
first of all you can learn about places that are around the world in a click
or you can just have simple talk and are great websites to keep in touch with old friends of you even make new friends
also he shows how members of the community treat each other as family regardless of race or ethnicity
everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing
it all comes down to learning and there is no censorship on learning
i hope you understand this better
that way when you get bored there is always something to do instead of being home all day
the worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water
i would make efforts to develop allround personality of the students
shes going to retake it and try again
are very commonly asked questions and should have attention put toward them
most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate but computers are updated so frequently you have all the facts all the time
also they help greatly with communication
for example i think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination
when i think of a i think of a quiet place that i can go to and read or study
in conclusion if even more censorship was done to public libraries libraries would be used less than they already are
in conclusion you can see how a computer can effect a person
computers benefit society and have great effect on people when they are balanced our with other important things such as exercise and socializing
that is just a few way that setting could harm you
there have been arguments over it so severe that it has went to court
even she heard their voices
the author also said that there was no way to express her gratitude for the generosity impressed upon her at such an early age
online you can go on any website and talk to people
i think his mood is every happy
but if they just sit back and think about it then it would be okay
the cyclist surrounds did have an affect
here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood his gratefulness and his view on things
you can tell thanks to the computer we talk more to his parents than he used to
they help you with things
for example pictures of weed cocaine or pills are in books
speeding the development of climate change
you are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public
if it were not for books and novels from the past the current generations would have no clue of what history was about
censorship helps prevent people from viewing listening or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups
i think they need to be removed from shelves or put away
the overall mood she created in this memoir was sad happy and peaceful
he had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope
you might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends
if you also how the economy is doing you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt
what can you say about that
this statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding water was very hard to find and scare
you can see computers are very much needed when it comes to school work
such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch
questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years and there is no simple solution
third the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text
although after approaching the old factory he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded
the most important thing in life is family and friends technology should get in the way of that
my opinion on this subject is its not right
although there are some positive computers can be dramatic
this is how i feel about books magazines music and movies
i would solve the difficulties of the teachers and students if i were the principal of my school
another reason computers could lower your quality of life
i believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye
the mood created by the author in the memoir come in different ways
total censorship is bad
too much time on computer
first i believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material
would argue that it was the greatest invention ever
i am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me
so next time when you want to buy something that maybe to mature for children you might want to reconsider going to the library
in conclusion personally i do not think censorship is necessary in libraries
another reason why is that you get to meet people
now you can talk and see a person in video chat
in the story he said this place might have been a thriving little spot but it was a ghost town
computers should disposed of before they cause the end of the world
well all you need is a computer
i believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned form their childrenbut not from the public
went up to the main desk and started complaining
is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what your there for
he also mentions that the sight was troubling which shows how big of an affect the features around him or scenery can have
the times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time
he was starting to go a little crazy
they might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer
it is unconstitutional to restrict any form of expressive speech whether it be books movies music or magazines
technology is not our enemy
desilting of rivers in the plains will also help
life is what it is from contributing factors
disgusting
a mother of the 
this again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death and not be able to make it
if so then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves
the hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes
by taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether
drinking drink after drink never having any water
no books are allowed to be read by the people
this is really helpful you want to learn about people from around the world
it is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you
his parents were selfless
now everybody would have to do what i wish
more and more people use the computer
books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves
then again if its too cold breathing gets really hard
computers are very helpful to many it gives them an education and they can interact with many people
the internet has a much broader range of articles so it is much easier to find information for any topic
but if your an adult you should be able to read listen or watch whatever you want to
computers are one of the most advance technology you can search anything in the world
i mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is
the computer can also help with business
kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision
well demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries
some for books some for magazines some for movies
so libraries have to have some censorship on there work there work should be removed so minors wont get the wrong message
we all get a laugh out of kind of stuff
i think that their should be rooms were certain adult books are at
now no one has to get in a car and go visit any one else
what if i told you allowed students to do better in 
for example in my life i use my to video chat with my sister  who is a freshman at college in 
from slavery to the future there are movies where i have learned a lot
to me it was irritating
have you ever taken a nice walk in the park
one reason i think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it
but she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord
these have been what i believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist
where do we draw the line
the mood created by the author in the memoir was in a very thankful mood
occasionally she will glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to 
i feel very happy to see the fruits plants and flowers in my garden
history books should not be censored because it is facts and teaching kids on what has happened in the past and how people survived
any parent would agree with that statement
my last reason we get to talk online
children need to see animals smell the sweet scent of flowers and feel the breeze brush against their cheeks
if everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves we would be fine
with this new technology you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time
tumbleweeds crossed my path  
computers do many things for us
in the end computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society
kids are told many times a week by their parents teachers and other adults to go the library
however work is a really large effect computers have on people
it seem as if viewing reading or listening to something violent or explicit would have an effect on the listener
i have read a book that people have wanted to ban and it was one of the best books i have read
i believe that if someone wanted to know more information about something the library or the should be able to provide it for them
with technology like this they save with just a click of that mouse
being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome
the memoir also shows this mood of graciousness for the understandings his parents taught him
overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up
i used to watch this girl named 
i support advances in technology because in the future
that why movies are rated so that a parent could what kind of movie their going to be watching
this made me think of my parents immediately
sitting on the computer for hours everyday is also looking exercise
the computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside
this is why the author wrote this memoir to thank his parents for what they did for him
recognizes this but also knows can never do enough to thank them
in the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist
some books are just too good to be banned
the girl wants to do that on that time of day and thinks she will get it next time
in conclusion you can see that i have clearly stated the benefits of computers
books are important to have
when i visit a library these items are very out of reach for children
the author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had
they enjoy simple dress and adorn their houses with necessary furniture
these are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me
a friend like that is helpful
most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest
fresh our will help that maybe going to the gym or jog outside for a while
speaking of hurtful the internet is very unsafe
a third reason computers not be help society you can see i feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society for many reason
he was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake
that does not mean that we should not provide information on different world religions simply because a person from another religion be offended
how cool is that reading this letter and sharing it to your company i believe that you should support my cause
then what if they want to keep listening to it
the beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh
many features in the setting affect the cyclist
you can send an email to someone and wait for a reply
years ago when i was in grade my class was reading a story about the  
the author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal
you can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country
my cousin is from 
show that you don like don watch it
if you want things that are more intense or out there then you can go to a bookstore instead of a public library
of course not
what if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time
i know that i would
why would anyone want to put this kind of material in there masterpiece
some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills
libraries usually require cards
in hibiscus by  the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone the hope and the representation of the essay
then everybody starts saying the foul language
the memory still haunts me
knowing that others have already successfully passed
 because a good friend to everybody else
if they limit their time on the computer and do some active game it would be better for the child
with each passing day computers help advance the future and help make the world a better place
some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented they will disappear
dear local newspaper i believe computers have a good effect on people
typing is used everywhere even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the 
she could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever i went
from their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft
some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views opinions and morals
this way you have more time to get extra from teachers on instrument in the school band
see what i mean computers are some and also a positive part of society
no on lived there it was abandoned
the story rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit tells of a biking trip gone wrong
are some books music movies and magazines out that are offensive
i also believe if we had a time limit on computers it is more a push to be social and go out and do things
first children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another
if computers are important to them the could they be destructive to society
in the final paragraph she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home
it enveloped you into its world and you felt every sensation it offered
we stayed in a hotel which was within a walking distance from the sea
he took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut
one instance of this media censorship
were do you go
plus you can get arthritis in your hands if you type to much
these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist
due to the advance in computers many people do not go outside as much anymore
i left her a voicemail and called her house phone instead the same thing bad happened
had to settle for what was given to him at the time
in public libraries things are a little different
kids can use computers to find information they need quickly
but if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie
do you see all people computers looking up facts about things as going on the computers learning
a person who is involved in sports is mentally and physically well developed
this shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting
the carpenter’s job is not easy
but i am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read
censorship is wrong our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another
furthermore children also have access to the public library
those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out of state family
but the people who like the item say like an explicit they would probably buy it
in which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty off the shelf
offensive media is almost anywhere
people can learn various facts right from their computers
the mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration
my point of view is that people have the choice to go out side exercise and enjoy nature
over one million people on the computer daily
being hot in  it has cyclist is around deserts causing more heat
the features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water out of date information and rolling hills
i would have to say yes to that question
this fantasy is possible you continue to use computers
right she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see
people can research learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online i think that computers have a good effect on people
it helps you at your hand movements
this causes the kids to act in different ways
had high doubt when saying that quote
it is an ideal school
i do not think that is right 
of all my reason that computers are bed this is by far the most disturbing
instead my father called using 
in the memoir written by the mood is happiness
they struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships
in conclusion i believe that censorship should not be used in libraries
setting in do not exceed posted speed limit really determines how the story turns out
also people of different religion could find it offensive
and we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening reading or watching
however it is also opening your eyes to new cultures
also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out
well i have done my part
learning about new places can help broaden the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation
if we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well
and in the present day world work is the only way to success
teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework when projects are  ext
if we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for
all you gotta do is go to that certain room look for  check out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
not being violent or cursing after everything you say is not going to hurt anyone
many features of the story effected the mood of the story
a good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride
to the editor of the  i am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society
born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book magazine or a movie
most of then will help you learn about the subject and then you have time to finish it and hang out with your friends
as a student i know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives
 you should be able to read any book listen to any music and watch any movie you want right
they just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of
the environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways
when you go to the library what kind of books do you look for
that are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist
he describes them as well as others in their community as honest hardworking selfless people
one major mood in this memoir is love and loving
so libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public
is what i thought the author in the memoir mood was
it drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this
with computers come the internet and with the internet comes games and social networking sites
the snake that he came upon must have been rather intimidating
he is every inch a gentleman
i picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and exercise your bones will become weak
without the descriptions in the novels a piece of history would unknown to many
they think the they always talk about everything day and other things
it is all about choices
he also creates a mood of happiness unity and overall loving that he has seen throughout his lifetime
i believe that children should have the right to know about some things but not all
some material have sex and violence that is offensive
as a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir
the more he works the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so
people were ordering online to get new computers
i believe that computers do not benefit society of all
we checked into a hotel and had our lunch
in one book that we read this year in my class was  
for example like in the book  of the  is an allegory
libraries have so many books and books that talk about everything so what would be the point of having a book taken off the shelves
at first when the cyclist set off in the morning the conditions were great
to sum it all up computers maybe but every single cloud has a dark lining
these materials do not have to be removed completely
this can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like
the setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the heat
his journey does teach you though that trough determination you will be rewarded
to a and were censored because of the racist language
my next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests
books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race
florence nightingale introduced the famous “nightingale oath”
the mood created by the author in this memoir is love and happiness
just remember to be careful
in school we should always wish our teachers
what would be left
when she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time
i believe they be correct
those are three of the most important reasons why i think computers benefit society
i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
it makes her feel more confident
if those are removed i do not think that people would care that much
the animals and the food they eat
computers have a positive effect on people
for one device to do all that is amazing
trees give us fruits for food and flowers for pleasure
also computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time
no you are not wrong because there are many people who think that some books should be taken off of the shelves of there local libraries
now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor
wasting the time they could be improving homework or walking the dog the time is not bring donated to a good source
this is because we would get less exercise less time to enjoy nature and interacting with family and friends
this is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive
putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society
all of these resources that kids can find that has this kinda of material in it can be found in libraries
as you can see computers have helped students all across the 
it helps us with things like learning communication and even money or economic problems
considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well he begins to struggle
talking to people from around the world can be interesting
the back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area
you could even keep in touch with them from 
but instead he just sit there online everyday eating
without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly communicate and find information in a fashion
their is just so much amount of time you can be on the computer for and not get bored
just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library
she is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better
if someone were to write a book about my religion i would find it interesting
even thought they are offensive they provide good details that are required for a good book
computers are very convenient
the author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then
around paragraph  the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family
also trees that gives us oxygen too
there i was shuffling my way through the library finding the perfect books to check out
if they did decide to remove these books are kids would have a hard time learning about the truth
does one person really speak for an entire gendercountry culture race religion
the internet offers virtual tours of places like the of even places can be explored without stepping foot out of your house
the internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner
we should earn through our efforts
on a computer you can find great things about a place and people
computers are a big part of my life and i still have time to do other things with my family and friends
with more advanced computers and technology there can be more special effects and move violence added to movies easier
it is a mixture of many gases
to wrap it all up computers save us money everyday
instead of going to the library and reading through all these books to learn something you can just go online
this ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent
there are card games board games even games
now a days people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her
since i am a teen i also know the problems with youths and computers
sometimes they eat potato chips and cookies and have soda
the author uses verbal irony when calling it a town town having it not really be a town anymore
this is a great idea
books that deal with slavery also be found offensive like the book 
i remember when my sister was in grade she never took her eyes off the computer
when the terrain began to change he writes sometimes life can feel so cruel he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water
i hope i made you all realize what a computer is really for
so if a relative or friend is farther away from a more or if they are down the street with chat rooms it makes talking easier
computer are also great for looking up places
it is a choice
you should not ban books because we have the freedom of press and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want
there are no books besides maybe math books that  offend at least one person or a group of people
in the end the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him
think about it your child could be out getting in trouble or be nice and safe at home playing on the computer
i like the saying sticks and stones break my bones but words will never hurt because it says if your offended then get over it
now some people would have been very offended by this book because the were calling the all those names that the do not like to be called
her handwriting is terrible so her teacher will not be able to score it
so as you can see i support the use of computers and i feel they are critical to peoples daily lives
personally i believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries
they go on and you can talk to someone in just a click
this is why when these movies are played on television they are edited so all audiences can watch
they could take it home and begin reading it and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them
in the technology is a huge part of society
libraries are places of learning
they will want to see the world
and they affect very crucial family time
this is because not only is quicker but simpler as well
i have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it
people can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them
they need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel to act to do even to think
so these are just some of the reasons i think computers could be bad
concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home
libraries have all kinds of people walking in and out everyday
clearly computers have become a part of every day life
in my own experience my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part
computer allow families to see each other online
sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book help the other person
because like i said everyone deals with it at one point and not everyone can be happy
people have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not
above all else there are millions of creeps on the internet preying on children as a young teens
this means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip
this is a hard question to ask
what they could be doing is enjoying life
then my family bought me a computer was so nice using the online dictionary
books are very important to our society
all people of have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free
the doctor will always be needed
which effects him because hes beginning to loose hope and thinks hes not going to make it
it is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others
this also revolves around addiction
then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes
finally i believe movies should be uncensored
for example ordering clothes and toys but most popular is doing your taxes online
the libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them
when your were a kid did your parents let you play all day on the computer
and watch movies
this shows that he is grateful of his culture
we all have seen a rainbow one day or the other
not only will computers impact people but it also impact family in friends
the third detail was that people gets very fragile and weak
another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness
why would you ask i do this
if it is a bad day then they will not want to but probably will
there is a fix to this with internet
also less kids are reading
they are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you
they would start a conversation with you like they would ask you for your name and where you live
i will teach the poor children without only charge
personally i believe in censorship but to others its a waste of time
so computer specialists what are you waiting for
and because they tend to want to type faster it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster
but if you choose not to utilize the internet there are many programs that are very helpful for learning
in the country of the united states there should be no such thing as censorship
there are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience
these skills be needed in their job field
he thinks the heat will kill him
some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for  computers can also help you read better it has little 
and they make writing a lot easier
because she reason is
so many books would be lost if someone could write because it was offensive
the music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in
the teacher tough me a few lessons
people have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it
there is a lot of confusion then
the sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels
this could result in a huge confrontation
he rings the bell in time
luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well
they should have a section just for those movies
its not because he created the fastest computer ever
however the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort
dear local newspaper i am going to write to you about if i think computers are a good idea or not
from birth parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong
i do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon we might just have to keep living with offensive products
an examples from the is
this will help us later on in life also
not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others
is there one at your house
if the library was privately owned then the owner could decide to put whatever books they wanted into it and censor whatever books they wanted to
to see the movie
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit written by the  the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling
dear post computers have been here for a while now and taking them away would be like forgetting all the progress we made in technology
there are so many things that effect our opinions
they use this to try and see more magazines
about of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life
if one person does not like a particular book or magazine they should search somewhere else for what they want
at last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk with friends
i never get tired of all the pictures all the gossip and all the jokes at the end
how would you like to talk with someone all the way down in 
the reason i say the computers are helpful is because it helps give direction helping the economy and because you can send messages thru quickly instant messaging
he hates nobody
kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it
that brings satisfaction to my life
i think that censorship in libraries and book stores is a good thing
parents should be happy that their teenager is reading and not playing video games or out with friends
and they should be going outside end running around
there are children around the age of in there and younger too
music you love be offensive to me
it had the word in there a lot
other than that i have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive
we need this fixed
i think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because has bad things online
but my brother said that they would get scared and run away
i for one think computers benefit society today and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step
library the facts are in the name
people need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone
i wish i could play with her like i do with my other friends
he had to travel a lot further then he had planned to
either way it would help them be a success in their life
if a child has permission to access a certain material then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate
most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre
labels such as or are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision
computers make it easier to connect to people near and far
this is a good way to use the computer because you can stay updated on what is going on with your family members
if you ask my opinion i would have to side with not removing certain booksmoviesmusicetc
you can have a job in the computer business
after along to more hows of playing
so you make the choice
i think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults
no and why might that be
how could you go wrong
in some aspects the experts are right
there is still more that a computer can do
and it beats playing on the computer all the time
the heat had affected him greatly as well
it is real relaxing to me
i do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries
should be censored in some cases
i believe that if something or someone offends you you have the right to take a stand
also there are advantages to reading books that show something different that that person have experienced before
i am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason
i hate violence
many people not realize it but what they read and watch greatly affects them
if certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects
you stay in touch while enjoying their company
libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning
for example the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort i think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test
one point after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes over on long crippling hill a building came into view
thank you for your time and thank you for reading my paper
this is why computers are so helpful because they give a way to research other places around the globe
movies now a days have come along way
last the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race
so why should any book be different because its not a big event like 
the libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it
more and more kids are falling into those traps
some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically
people many years ago used to read books on scrolls or even in pictures to tell stories
these help you find long lost sibling or whom ever you want to find
they follow what technology to make life 
a flute seller was playing on his flute
books magazines movies music etc are all good to read watch or listen to
sex drugs cursing etc
this question might be answered forever
if they have life problems then they seek the solitude and privacy of unfiltered and limitless internet
what be offensive to you not be offensive to the person sitting next to you
should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive
she found strength in herself and courage to do better
there are many different races and people with different religions living here
it goes from flat road to rolling hills
what look vulgar to someone might not look so offensive to another individual
this is just another great use of computers
movies can teach a lot about different countries and books do a wonderful job as well
i really astonishing how much education we have gained from using the computer
within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic
they will one day take over
this is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many many different kinds of books
our media is very powerful and should not be censored
people from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive
a freedom of thought and a freedom of press present within our nation and increasing in presence around the  precludes the idea of this censorship
some mystery books have parts in them that be offensive
l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth
but computers can be a bad thing
kids when they are little their brains are like sponges so they learn and remember stuff well at that age
and one of those many thought to be impossible was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds
when voted one it could stay or be removed
i think that computers are good
have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf
you have a system
being a student i am commonly curious about what references teachers are making and additional information that is not provided
i grow some vegetables also in my garden
it allows people to stay in touch learn about places and people and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news
could use it for info on a project or homework
so we wait for the postman eagerly
say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army
the main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library
his method of teaching is convincing and inspiring
if we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed
this section are for the younger children
such as a book magazine music album or a movie
these probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him
some like offensive things that they have in the library
their child might even have the right to it
computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers
i think i agree that computers affect people
more and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies
although computer gaming is a big reason why kids go on the computer bullying is a huge factor along with stranger danger on chats
when an author must take this into consideration
out of people have gotten in big trouble through the 
this shows how much she misses home
computers are useful in school
it is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about
taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library
here are my reasons why
when the sun sets the darkness follows
my third and last reason is their job
so if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left
do you really want to write it all
this can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time
he tells them how important the fruits are for a healthy body
you cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart
they are making people fat not getting there exercise eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology
some authors do this in a very offensive manner
first computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy
one mood in this memoir is courage these two people show courage when they get here and they keep that courage for a very long time
everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways
lastly the author created the mood modesty
he is my class fellow
we should have the right to read listen and watch what we enjoy but younger children or other age groups should be monitored
they enrich our minds
this quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed
technology has helped many people and still continues to
another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks
other they being bored all the time you can play thousands of game with just a click on a mouse
then what happens to that homework
censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination
lets say you had a job designing houses to be built
so as you can see technology benefits our society in a big way
because then you would no how old they are 
so why waste money flying to see someone to deliver a simple message when you can deliver it personally in almost less than seconds
is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take
the green fields looked very beautiful
months went by before i realized and i were great friends
the lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people
things will be much simpler in the long run
television is basically the same for movies
they once per a day after the sunset
lets say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away
so the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there
in another newspaper not long ago it stated that a student attending  was dropped out for doing so poorly during school
in the following you will see why i computers have its benefits to the society
what the book stores libraries and movie stores should do is put an age limit on the books and movies
if we should not forget why should the youth learn
i have good reason why i think people are on the computer a lot
some people say that computers are a bad influence on 
but you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you
“you must not lose faith in humanity
the memoir is basically about family and how important family is
there is also a website called 
these quick changes happen without thinking and become a natural habit
reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option
a lot of the movies are adult movies but they do have a kid section at a lot of the libraries
opinions are alternated often about many different things being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful
another thing that is somewhat related to this
meeting and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom
along with websites games and networks are also very popular and addictive
most of the time after school children stay in the house and do stuff instead of going outside
these days come quite often but what does do
he was saving up his energy and his water
this is the reason for the author to conclude his story like he does
some might say  means that the people of will be much more green
taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it
also the internet is helpful for work
another reason that a computer benefits society is ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live to far away
school websites have information about classes events and clubs
the man feels like their is nothing left and its the old men who caused this
how can you make fun of someone who does self harm
certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at
they live on the other side of the state country even world
in this story the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist
like i said everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it
she advises them to work hard and study
what can you do to change
without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it
i think computers have a huge effect on people
dear newspaper people 
some people are impulsive by nature
but i can understand the other side of the issue
but the most important part of using a computer is to enjoy it and have fun
because it was hot and empty he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist
it is already and we are using the computer for so much
with a computer you can
this problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites
teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks
most people like the songs because it says to do bad things they just want to be heard or want attention
so i decided not to remove the books from the shelves so the people who did not find them offensive could read them if they wanted to
if that was someone you loved
if a person wants to check out a book that is offensive they should be allowed to check it out and read it
also she likes the geese and the hibiscus and these things might make her feel more comfortable
the library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types
that way there would be no problems
one narrator states i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated 
how do you think the world would be without computers
movies could also get kids to be bullies
computers are helping schools teach students
fake and bogus writings is a small problem to readers and writers
she is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic
another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides too you
the flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life
there are truly you can learn on the internet
as you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist
if they do not want to then they do not have to
these three themes set the mood of this memoir
a computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about days
learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading but also the human race
all work and no play makes jak a dull boy” is an old saying
animals are very faithful and helpful
they were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf
the biggest surprise is that there is online dating
the problem i think is people not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it mean
computers help us do research they keep us connected with friends and family and they are required to be used at some 
most modern day businesses are run by computers
furthermore how would be able to even start a fire without how to light a match
if you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question
told me that
books are cultural objects and our minds are molded by the books we read
the thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous
many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways
surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good and they believe that people will buy their product
it is a good source of entertainment
besides interfering with our computers do the same with education
even though many restrictions put in place there are still some faults to the system
this is not what our envisioned to become and they were right
i believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children
authors are brilliant people
this type of material should only be given to an older audience
a boy can play football on line then take what he learned and use that in a real football game
next is the hills
one more detail about the mood is that he sounds very grateful for what his parents did and the hard choice they had to make about moving to 
i shall try to be an ideal teacher
you the even uses computers to write your articles for the paper
when it is raining outside your parents are at work and you are by yourself and have nothing to do turn on the computer
this could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they become violent or depressed
dear  much do computers affect our life
he really shows the people who have read his memoir that he respects his parents and thanks them so much to make his life better in 
as soon as i put my ear to her head phones i turned it off immediately
another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other no matter where their location is
can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place
my final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature
when you listen to music  it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from
many of the older people think that it is not fair for them
that is the problem
i think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer
those people do not have to read books that they find offensive
these days children learn about things sooner and sooner
this computer madness is losing lives we cannot allow this to continue
this shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives
the censorship start out as a small intervention but it could turn our nation upside down
what about your health
the computer craze does not stop kids will continue not to go out side and get to have some fun
when i read this memoir i felt happy reading it
you could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location
although to some people this argument go either way if the line is never drawn on what is available who knows what the world come to
this shows that she really is adjusting to her new home and has hope for when spring comes and the geese return and hibiscus bloom
interacting with friends  family is better than talk thru the computer
dear local newspaper i am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society
also in the story it states flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
if a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books less children would pick up the wrong book
why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves just out of reach of the children
also you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened
children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little but they go on the computer instead
these excerpts really convey the of nostalgia warmth and thankfulness to the reader
there were no computers this hand eye coordination could never developed
for example if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic
it has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves
this is one reason the computer is a good source
censorship to most people means much more than the average syllable word
finally the cyclist sees a building in the distance but again deserted
that had to change your mind or nothing will
his lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things
some are impatient and look at their watches at every other second other are worried and fret
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
think yourself calling your best friend who lives in 
some newspaper have websites you can read the paper without actually paying for the paper this saves you money and was less paper we can save trees
if a child checks out a book and their parents let them it is the parents fault
though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries
at first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground
if libraries take the information out of the library the students will not be able to find the info needed for their project or paper
family to him that he be learned is not just his parents sisters and brothers
everything in life is as rhythmical as a wave upon wave on the seashore
dear local newspaper i believe that computers are bad news
this statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do
lastly computers are beneficial because they help education
i strongly believe that computers are a very helpful resource that make day to day life easier
there are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned and future people would not be able to enjoy them
in conclusion libraries should not censor any of their materials
this is extremely dangerous and unfortunately it does and has happened
computers are what makes all this possible
if you can talk online then you can probably talk to people in real life
as she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked  did you like your book 
they teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience
overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework
the addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or you see are real life situations and activities
the features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways
dear  experts are concerned about the use of computers
so if they wanted to read a book like that they could probably get it off the internet even if they can not in libraries
and if you are connected to the internet you can play games with other people around the world
movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time
are some good reasons why computers are good and help you
what kind of message are we trying to send to them
as you can see computer benefit society helps peoples hand eye coordination
also the book be very enlightening to another person and removing it completely would be unfair to them
some might find this offensive but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them
the definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time
you have to act now before its too late and computers have over taken the world
any water he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills but he had no choice
in the last book  it has a lot of profanity in it
it can tell you about crimes that are happening
people would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online
you can go on sites that you on your 
most people live meeting other people online
the censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed
on the other hand it also helps with your education
ever since the invention of the computer people have seen promise for society
others can get mad at a movie because discriminates races of other kinds
it could only get worse
the parents or even kids are not spending lots of time with each other due to the computers
now that is in shape for any sport plays
i personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some even more
libraries are a source of information
during his time at  he discovers that he is a homosexual
dear  i believe that computers have a negative affect on people
as you know the author of this book is named 
the butterflies make our homegardens beautiful and help in the pollination of flowers
the flower makes her happy and reminds her of home
in the following paragraphs i will explain on reasoning
lastly computers help students because if they need help they can just ask one of their friends through the computer
while at lunch she slipped and dropped her tray of food
it really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with
the issue that is going around is computers have good effects on people or bad ones
has been known for rapping about drugs sex money and violence
i know for me the internet has come in handy for school projects or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word
as grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him
he should get up early in the morning he should go for a morning walk every day
she is filled with new resolution when she says to herself then i will take the test again
it is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it
thank you for your time
while my mother was fine with me watching the movie some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate
the computer also allows you to talk with people far away
computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet
once again they are distracting dangerous and hurt families
that is just another example why the computer has a positive effect
that is that great thing about technology
also offensive materials have made an impact in society for ages
so that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books
things like this still go on and the rate at which they happen are in creasing
this is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places
if they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with
after the breakfast i go to the bus stop to catch my school bus
for example if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway they could type in the place and see what it looks like
travelling makes us see things people and places with our own eyes
not only is it a punishment for them but it is also to keep them away from other people
if you are a social butterfly and love to converse with other people then you simply must own a computer
i have aunts that i cannot live without who are strong base who i cant live without talking to for a day
it can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life
first reason that computer have a positive effect on people
this is not a hard decision to make
because of the internet people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors
at peak hours there is a mad rush
i think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps make learning about other countries easier
our heart beats all day and all night
so i believe and i feel that she must be the most beautiful woman in the world
i personally concern with these people computers have a positive effect on people
like we went to a hot exotic place mom looked it up to see what we should pack to go there
many people use this method for jobs
when i was in sixth grade i was in a foster home that i hated
for people that are more vulnerable to those situations or seeing those things it could greatly help with some people and show them that it is not right
not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing well but i believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms
communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people
they have just started to be able to use the computers so many times they go through a phase or addiction
it was dry and hot and he had no water
our teachers taught us to be nice and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same
there are more reasons how people are being affected by computers but these are the most common
you can learn about the history of presidents countries important people musicetc
in my opinion the computer has been one of the best technologies in history
children nowadays have it hard on themselves why make it harder
they affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains
censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech
there is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves
i also read every single one of books
we go through all the trouble of turning on and opening pages just to chat online
there were books about politics religion sex and violence
when i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on a 
do you use a computer
people should always treat others the way that they would like to be treated
the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech
how would you feel if you went another country and knew nothing about it
i think they should overlook it
it does not bother me when they do this
is because children that read it could join in on what the book is suggesting
to stop yet another generation from messing up their lives taking the materials off is the best solution
any time i look through the library i come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate
another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things
since we are all different
so i think computers are very important and they are needed in people lives
but even though this could happen what type of free run by the people for the people group are we now
we have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do
the of was created to insure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control
reading this made me feel grateful for what i have and think of all my parents did for me and sacrificed
i have reasons
students use it for studying and making projects look better
he was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant
dear i think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it
the public has to accept those choices
emails are a great way to send information
all sorts of people go to the library
one way computers benefit society is by making it easier for everyone to get information about something
such as talk to friends play games even turn off your lights
do you love to have friends overseas
 and  now
let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil
dear newspaper  my name is and i believe that computers have a negative influence on people
but i am happy that i could learn to ride at last
those old men had him through neck and been once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions
several great leaders such as the first president of the   decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country
you can meet new people and is a good way to make life even better
a man falling ill may be cured by ordinary medicines if given in time
so the fail is slowing her down
my third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life in a good way
this could also be a way to learn another language
people will eventually see them hear them and watch them even if its not in the library
if you ask me i think they should leave up their
well thus where same opinion i had about the computer
that way you are happy and so is everyone else
thank you for your 
though the users think there is nothing negative about using the computers but there is
for example a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it
allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document
they still cant tell whats real and whats not
the matches are lit by parents to light fires or candles but what happens when a natural disaster strikes like in or 
they let people talk online
as is normal throughout all deserts the sun is blazing hot as is the sand
like the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs sex money and violence
also make sure you know who your friends are
offensive language be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases
books be the only exception
but then some books are not offensive too everybody so it would be unfair if all books were removed from libraries
how many humans inhabit the world today
i like my school very much
in the end either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people
some people do not agree that computers are good
that we need them to communicate to other people
when i tried a drop or two it had the flower of battery acid
they can however now just get them on the go
libraries are a communal institution open to all views and writings
yes i agree every material has something in it that another person does not like
please reread and pick the right 
yes it be true that adults like to read about sex and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read
on each video there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or dislike said video
get to know them in person and not over the internet
so i do not agree with censorship in libraries
computers benefit society because we can learn about places we want to go
spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family
for example the job
third it helps people with school and sometimes work
there should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities
being allowed to write how they feel is what is practically based on
also from experience i have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling
the way this author wrote this memoir he created multiple moods
with all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop
every other child in the world has done something similar
just because you do not agree with every little thing that someone writes does not mean that someone else in the world does not
censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today
this short cut turned out to be a nightmare
have you ever wondered how libraries pick their books
censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn
how do i know this
 the computer takes time away from nature
like when you go to see a rated movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie
censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society
when it comes to censorship i believe that very few things should be removed
then he came to a rough road
make sure you go outside and have a great time too
not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family
online communication is a fast simple and effective way for people to communicate whether is at home or at work
ever consider what books get banned from the library
this is my opinion expressed in words about how i feel about the whole topic
when you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life
i believe that the books with violence which helps to convey and important point which should not be missed should be displayed by school libraries
first she wants to adapt to the new this new land
being addicted to the computer is too
this can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet
computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with
many libraries in the world have censoring on their materials
google gives you answers to anything
libraries they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them
most importantly with his lack of water in his bottles all of these characteristics were harmful
because you would spend so much time on the computers
if we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library there would be nothing left
those are the reasons why i benefit people using computers
it be against some religions to read inappropriate materials
meeting people over technology especially for miners is a huge risk
once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them
my second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people
the time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers
we just need to find it again
he is healthy and strong
every book has a different experience that can help a child learn
if you keep them from a book or etc they might end up reading it in the long run
computers are a good source to have now that is just my opinion
so should we take them off the shelves
censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others
people would rather sit at a computer for hours doing wonders of our world
lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family
i hope you chose to inform others with this information
he will get dehydrated
having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away
the mood is mostly calm  happy because telling the courage his parents had
he had little water and his area had tough terrains
learning and the are online job to be online
whenever i have spare time i go to my small garden
the freedom we have is a freedom of choice
computers are making people unhealthy
the cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign but he kept going
you can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself
school children should try to become gentlemen someday
but if one person complained and the book is no longer there does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on
yes they think that there is no real harm
but one hour or more is too long
in conclusion the computer can ruin your life and can make you go blind
what does that mean
no i do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries
computers do not benefit our society today
i believe there should not be any censorship in libraries
well those are my suggestions to you
he shouts in the street in an interesting tone
but for you close family you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing
the question then is do computers have positive effects on people
after lunch we bid them goodbye and returned home
some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else
those who complain are only making more work for themselves
pride hath a fall
also a class that at 
when people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries
he was overjoyed
there was some flog and not much traffic on the road
the stuff wrote sang or played in these things harm these people but that is not what it is in there for
there are hundreds of websites that will let you watch it for free
the features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather
people could assume that drugs kill you
heart disease is caused by obesity
everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the has to follow
all in all we have to be fair
three out of five homework assignments are on the computer
there even working with computers to make better bullet prove vest so they will be more lives saved in war
a movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example although the same thing can happen in books just with words instead of pictures
disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library
not only is happening in the libraries its happening on televisions also
i inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions
weather can make them use up their water faster or slower rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower
when was finally free from a main goal was to have our freedom of speech
the author explains of how he felt of his parent that risk everything in order to give him a better future according to paragraph 
take my friend for example
even walking home from school with a friend is a good way to be outside
the neighbours say that this boy had killed a large number
the author creates many different moods throughout the memoir
dear local newspaper you imagine a world without computers
if they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone
the butterflies are handled very carefully as their colours easily rubbed off
at first it wont be easy but its worth it in the long run
next you get no exercises
so in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus
there are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want
secondly computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others world
the level increased dramatically and so have the high pressure level
you will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older
she sees it as being indomitable renewing and beautiful
 computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town
that is the whole point in reading is so you can learn
features of the setting could affect the cyclist
but if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job
innocence in the library was gone
we should be string enough to look away and not fight about it
on the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression
when he talks about his friends being like his family it makes people grateful for their close friends that they have
that would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves and it takes little effort from all parties involved
so the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways
what is offensive
i have been to many libraries in my life
like the program excel created this to make a simple way to organize data
history has given the world many a cruel dictator
so i think computers are a great machine for people to have
the computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher
the setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way
the mood in the memoir was to show what family is that its much more than blood
the mood created by the author in this memoir is a very calm mood
these things are everywhere and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem
these type of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books but have been distributed to the teen section
when she gets the chance
computers are used from leaning or for fun
neptune is the farthest planet
something that is offensive to me not be offensive to another
they have many features
instead of talking hearing voice on the phone
this place is wack
my last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day
the brain is like a because you can store information and nobody can hack into it
be like me and get rid of your computer
dear editor of the  people say that technology is affecting everybody left and right
kids need to get away from the computer
if someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that
we can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on 
in the us we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles and religions this is one reason i think censorship is against policy
i do agree this is the case in some ways
so learn experience and express
the censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust
if there is a burglar going around people can find out and lock all doors and windows
that at least she could hold onto
first the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot making it hard to pedal
in this passage the mood is set to be grateful happy and loving right from the start
i encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone so they know all the benefits to using computers
dear local newspaper editor more and more people are using computers but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea
lots of kids and teens go online to make new friends
it is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house
i also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about
at some works the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having and about meetings
homes offer security and feel affection for human life and it is one of the most important things
lastly when viewed carefully computers are very reliable and can be made extremely safe which eliminates the main fear computers
i think they should be certain magazines in the library
you can just login and talk to anyone in the world
if a student sees something offensive or violent on a book there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers
i am  i have been playing in for 
some people think that materials in a library should be censored while others think everything should be allowed to be there
i have read many different things in my lifetime so far
overall i think that censorship should be allowed at high schools
nothing good comes from making people feel bad
and you can learn new things that you have no clue about
finally the last great thing about the internet and computers is that you can entertain yourself through online games and movies
i really hope the people make the right choice
movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view
most students use them every day
which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novelmagazinesmusicor movies
due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular
but if she falls again the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her
just to make the other person feel better
but even more importantly what good is hiding the truth
a recent study by and the studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer
i like getting the full effect out of things
if you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school
she sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for
movies music books etc
of course there are benefits
i feel that however possible you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires
kids are now staying up later on the compute in turn lowering grades
he passes a water pump just what he needs yet the water is something close to toxic
he believes in simple before his students
this means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane they can just play a game or watch some television
next i will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you know
of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family
books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading
each generation of men dies but its thoughts and knowledge that pass from age to age and faithfully kept
i believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style
not all children and teens are drawn to reading
with all of the new devices we have  people can just get their books online
we all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations
dear the  computers do not benefit society
basically i think the computer is a huge time and effort saver that every household needs
the plant will go through a cold and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring
the chances seem bleak
when they just take it off everything will be in grate shape
everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them
it could always be much worse than what it is
instead of spending hours on your feet go sit on your computer for ten minuets or less
censorship along with many other things is relative
so the night before i did a bunch of research of different shops museums and places to eat
it is known that anybody is able to rent books movies music and magazines in libraries
this in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader
parents is this what you want for your 
it should be up to the children what they read
she is grateful for their perseverance and for their strength through this whole process and thanks them over and over again
when purchasing items online you never really know what your going to get
traffic came to a standstill
especially pertaining to what books magazines movies and music almost all people are reading watching and listening to
for example instead of sitting on the computer much go outside and play soccer kickball and more
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist
no one would have any food to eat at a restaurant at school or any where else not even at home
now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on or a newspaper
i know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things
there were rusted water pumps with hot water but nothing to cool him down
i have heard of many books
also some people need their computers for their jobs
the when they came back quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself
shes saying there always a second chance
when he finally reached the store he was excited and relived
 he sees a building up ahead and discovers that its a walrus grape juice factory
that is why i believe computers benefit society
he called it a substance it had a flavor of battery acid
i am the fifth child of my parents
the cyclist felt black humor due to the features
regardless of who is reading it
they are categorized just as much as books and music
the final reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his hardworking parents
what can you do
she researched it and got how to the mark go away
they help communicate around the world
local newspaper i think that computers have a huge affect on people
for example last i went to tennis with mom and shes never on the computer
we ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive
computers help organize your thoughts which helps reduce stress
finally once you have your information all you have to is your source
i had a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer
in this type of setting it would be fine to allow any type of book in the adult section marked mature
thank you for your time
this can cause great tension or sorrow in families
i moved again
censorship has been around for a very long time and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning 
he and his whole family have respected each other and others
he has many instruments for his work
they have gone to the college fund for money
when i grow up i wish to have a horse of my own like brownie
i feel that too many people are becoming addicted to computers
so finn runs away from the custody of his father and meet another boy
that means everyday someone can learn something everyday of their life
i was talking to cousin on the account said his name but it was his wife
the creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to
you could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer
books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get there point across
without computers society would not run as smoothly as it does now
well i personally do not go to a library but many others do
i have come up with reasons to support my opinion
it is a faithful companion
do you think way too many people are on the computer
as i mentioned before when the police officer came to our school he talked about this
that is of course an obvious statement
i for one do not approve
out of all the things that need to be censored the library is not one of them
people can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree
they their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history
when i read the above statistics i came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing
if anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people
sometimes people save money because they buy something online a sale than going to a store and paying anymore money
the slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship
in all of these websites you can keep up with whats going on with your friends and whats new around the world
the articles would probably be after the events occur
when people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got
you are the mother or father of a young child and you take them to the library
this is what the mood was in the memoir of was portrayed as
should we put a censorship on the libraries really
world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books
this winter i experienced the coldest night of the season
efficiency means not speed
million of information is found on the internet
it causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water
there is one goalkeeper two fullbacks three half backs and five forwards
ever since they were invented computers have been advanced more and more even years
they are out in the world and and there is nothing that you can do to stop it
you cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves but what you can prevent you should
he read the passage and his eyes went wide
some people might say that computers are useless but that is not true
with all of these exceptionally great things we can all live in a happier better world
the author mood and body were greatly affected by that features of the setting
the book was full of adventures
the water runs out and we are now it our conflict
this is a great advancement in our society
if we had all of this then there would not be any more problems
so parents please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer
so make sure they all stay clear and far away from them
these are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places
my opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day
the large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned grape juice factory added to the hopeless lost tone
the computer saves money for a lot of us
yet again our next and final issue
he is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep
i would only go on for a little bit to talk to your friends
the lion can be seen in asian and african forests
for example say you have a turkey in the oven and your so in the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off
a majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items nor would they understand them if they did
i thought of getting down it was then that my eyes fell on a dog
the mood of this memoir is warm and friendly
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways
he does not waste and electricity
last month our class teacher took us for a picnic
you want the kids in to spend hours each day on the computers playing games while they could be outside getting fresh air
i would listen to the complaints of the students
the setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist
its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer
teenagers can play games on the computer
it is naturally hot in the summer but in the desert it is twice as hot
newly explain now they not online and got so close they 
also knowing about the different cultures of the people in far away places gives people a better perspective of the world they live in
in conclusion this is why i think that computers are a positive effect on people
the topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one especially with younger kids
were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them
see a message so computers interesting with friends and family
a strong nation is being built with well disciplined society performing its duty efficiently at all levels
offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result
the choice of what material you read should be left up to you not restricted by what someone else finds offensive
i think they should leave up there
lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers
offensive books and movies can cause many problems
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness
the author is grateful that his parents left their homes and left everything behind to give a better life to their kids
there were also ropedancers and magicians
anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone
after all her sadness within the story she finally gets the energy back to tell herself keep trying
how do we keep them safe from offensive literature
they had many celebrations with family and friends and everyone cared about each other
i like my school very much and i am proud that i belong to it
she buys the flower and returns to her new home to her mother who is working in the garden
i use to search it all the time and i made a poster project for fun
be open minded
with little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist
however even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in
we could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do
there is much censorship that occurs in the world
our learning our beliefs and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship
just think of all of the things we rely on this device to do
they provide us with a wealth of entertainment enable us to communicate with one another and even help us learn
dear of my local news paper you believe this garbage that the so called expert are saying about computers
he looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch
i was to scared to see how long the other lists were
leisure is an important need in our lives
he gets up early in the morning and goes to his clinic
my second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a  you can go online to check what you have for each subject
censoring is a good and bad thing
i know it will surprise you when i tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day
even if the are across the country you can still chat with them for free
songs today hint at sexual activities
authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next
then once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good
the hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring this shows that winter is its weakness
lets say you want to know about someone famous you look it up on the computer
for example fly a plane
do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives miles away
they let you communicate quicker
when people come in looking for some good information about something they look forward to finding good tips and not being let down
i have once read a book with very mature content
there are so many different means of communication using the computer which are all free
and try to find where you like and come
people just want to get their voice out there and to be heard
this profession is not only arresting
i feel that censorship affects the writers and school system
censorship for books
finally computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost
there are many examples of this literary technique throughout history
there is just so many things that the computer can help us with
his son is of my age
romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds
all in all material in libraries can be offensive to some people
it involved taking a note cards from different sources
can make a change
dear  you know more and more people are starting to use computers
we need computers for life we always will need to use computers for every single day of our lives
magazines these days are even worse
everybody in this world needs to see that their are things were not going to like but we have to get over them and move on
so these ideas hardly leave any other opening for me
my second reason why i think this is because when your having a party and you need invitations the computer can help you
he made me feel like i was invited to his home with open arms and i could feel the environment around me
computers helps the locate most wanted criminals
well it all lead back to money
the sun gives us light and heat
i hope you are for the mind tips and family
this has also helped us in wars
this way no one will know that they read it
there are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offensive
however is that really the right choice
she took those books the ones people were complaining about and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk
the mood created by the author in the memoir was admiration
time my computers crashed and i had a report due but all the books were gone
it is your choice to read it
however will be threw a computer site world wide web
have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your ever day life
libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves
when she see this plant he childhood comes back and she forgets her test
try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries
teachers principals business men and even children deserve the right to reading what they like
this sentence lets readers know that times are hard now but in time things will get better
i soon found out it was a book that i would never actually read
we become illiterate without books magazines and other things of that nature
an i can check how teams are doing
my sister went to the kitchen and tried to some work
you can find history on almost everything from the past to the present
parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong
now on to more about why
i think this because they talk mainly about the good thing in their childhood
electricity is generated with the help of water coal and even sun rays
the author explains throughout the memoir how his parents were caring and loved to help others
i also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else
he explains how much he appreciates the love and care given to him by his family
he is clever at studies
when you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one because the salesman talks then into it
to display these materials
when you don interact with your friends your friends might not bother trying to talk to you
this happens because they are more comfortable interacting through the computer
even with that being true the question truly is will it do you any good to take those things away
well you can always use the computer to find out more about the place
she is determined to pass the test
taking things off shelves also has a good side to it
dear  technology has been advancing at a rapid rate for many years now making life much easier for everyday people
libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests
online news is widely popular  extremely beneficial to many people
this is great for not only school children but adult to
in the story it said drop from heatstroke
there is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say
he had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out
in my opinion it would be beneficial to students parents or teachers to get information on different topics
dear  more and more people do use computers but it is not a bad thing
the kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence
another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it make other reads feel like they are not alone
let me throw out an example to you
if there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life
you look at the screen type your words look at the screen again while clicking your mouse
the dangers are always there
censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer
last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
they want to fit each magazine personally to each individual
maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear or see
as the debate continued i myself begin to ponder the subject
they involve cursing killing gun battles and sexual content
i sat quietly next to him
parents need to sit down with their when they have questions and discuss the truth with them
so i have mixed feelings about computers
it is evident that computers are effective and are advancing technology in our society
another time where computers are handy is at tax time
everyone has a right to read listen or watch what they want
therefor computers do have a positive effect on people you can stay communicated updated with the latest news and have an advance education
that means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family
if libraries censorship books and everything else on the shelves there would be nothing left for children at the libraries
the authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important
thinks when the time a to kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable
i believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves in a library
opinions can cause a lot of problems
computers help people stay organized
using a computer can also help you stay organized
a great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club
when surrounded by new digital age
libraries should have the right to have any kind of text movie magazine or genre of music that is desired for a student to learn from
and because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it
so she is going to be reading to prepare for when the spring comes when the hibiscus is budding then she will be budding too by passing her test
i think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air
until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone
just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it
if exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke
over all addiction in everything including computers and a horrible 
i turned out that their short cut was wrong
in a public library many children who the books are censored for are with their parents
there was no one insight not a building car or any structure of any kind 
people use books to forget their troubles and take a trip to somewhere outside of themselves
it showed her getting used to her environment
so as you can see computers has its benefits because it can teach you social skills
throughout the years many events have taken place in our history
this is the fault of an immoral world
games could possibly be very useful when you need to prepare yourself something
though many people might go against it
that is why the author concluded with this paragraph
they are good at students too
and it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends
everything in the world is in one computer
if it to graphic for kids put it in the adults area
although the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip
their is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad always a good attitude
there were shops of bangles readymade garments toys and sweets
everything in the story is about to change
 
you can also look out to nature
i do not think it should matter weather we have music movies or magazines in the library
kids are never outside again
i prefer to go on educational scientific and historical tours also
on the computer what exercise benefits are you getting
nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though of course
one could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses
music if it has an sticker you have to be over to rent it
any one has the right to anything
of kids in my school own a computer
have you ever had a computer
should them type of things but in the with children
as a consequence kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the all day instead of exercising
also when i go on the computer
now there is two things gone from the shelve but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off
this leads to my finally topic
also they made him a home
many people have there own personal view on this subject
engineers use programs on the computers to help design what they are going to build
it has all facilities a good school should havewell furnished classrooms laboratories library and playground
the poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said
some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes
some people like certain movies such as action comedy romance or drama
your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers
this also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail which costs money unlike email
it shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life
just like how i talk to people about a band we both love
sure you might get complaints
you might need it for typing a paper for school or work and you can use the internet
personally my parents would be horrified to see grotesque inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them
education can get anywhere if you want it
people like this are more likely to gain weight have little social time and spend too much time inside
movies and television
would you like to be on the computer and throw away your life
he is a businessman
if your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family
he should show good results in the examinations
not everyone can do these things but everyone who has a computer can
soon he was carried away in a car
for one computers help with entertainment
some people are going a little bit too far when it comes to older teens
many kids are adamant about it but with the help of a computer they will be more willing to get it done
lastly people are losing their desire to do everyday things
some kids enjoy reading adult books
so this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting
in some countries people distill seawater and get fresh water
if it is winter the least kids could do is go sledding
then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library
eating for hours each day to not a good idea
i personally love books about drugs sex and many other inappropriate things
i for example have learned so much from
humans also pollute water in many ways
when she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus her mother says that it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here
i only get to see her once or twice a year in person
one example is because he said they where all family to them
whether it be children teens adults or elders some things are inappropriate and should not be accessible to certain people
not only are the helpful but they are fun and easy to use
if you just even look out your window to see this beautiful god created for us you would want to go out there and enjoy 
the rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist
this can help keep families in touch
many people in use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things
i want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out
the internet is also a dangerous place and the growing computer use with maximize the problem
some people find them offensive because they might have bad things in them
it makes a bad impression on some people
libraries are for obtaining information and for reading not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics
finally learning is a huge deal with people today
not to fear super duper computer is here
not even waste minutes on you phone
i understand that people do not want there kids to see them or hear them
as you can see the setting greatly affected the cyclist
helps them with school and taxes
thirdly family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should
i like her appearance very much
my father went to drop them back home
also foreign places become closer to home when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries
these are three huge advantages than using computers give people
get off your computer and go for a walk
after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit
sometimes it will be in effect while at other times it will not
that shows that he is grateful to have friends and family
if you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer then i doubt you were
the flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills
i hope i have shown you as an independent person my statement was true
the common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please
the town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt in that it is increasing
no i not believe there should be any censorship in libraries
so they try to get them out of the library
this is a very difficult topic to argue with
but like all good things too much computer time can be harmful
but to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its there friend
books can be offensive to many people
i know that when my library had a series of books that i found interesting that i was back in there after i finished each one
different genres of music even send bad messages
when your reading online you just read what people say basically rumors
there is no absolute divine being that can accurately judge a material
there can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap
have you ever researched anything using a computer
the question is should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways
so just because i agree with everything i said  are you going to agree with it also
by going on the computer i learned all i needed to know and they some
i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
for example on some computers a business software can be incorporated allowing a meeting to be help over the computers
the film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces
the libraries really need to just stop and think for a second is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment
i could make that he said
i had finished my syllabus but i was still very worried
lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function
keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall
you could take any famous work and someone could be offended it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs
i made sure my parents were not home when i watched it
we need to do things on our own more often and stop relying on computers to do everything for us
to prove there over twenty 
reading this material give off bad information to a child
they narrated the story of their home
a very popular game is the 
third of all if you can chat online with your friends or family
so i asked my mom i can go to she said yes
something that someone might find offensive might be interesting to someone else or they might have to do an report or project on it
these are the mood created by the in the memoir
also they have the ability learn more on the computer
if the materials should be moved they should just be moved to a different area not off of the shelves totally
in nature there is always some thing new
computers make things a lot easier for a lot of people
i recently seen photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding 
books music movies etc they all can be found there
finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up
another feature was the grape juice factory also abandoned so he hung his head and that blues tune summer time rattled in his brain
our youth have the right to access these materials
on your report card
certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries
finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility
i think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful and satisfied and that he is loved
i reason that computers are more unhealthy for us
also computers have so many different forms of entertainment
if we did not have search engines life would be a lot harder
as you can see nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature
there will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored
when this failed the cyclist was even less determined
you get your information from books and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time to get to a local library
it is understood that there is both bad and good in the world and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that
we all would have not personality at all
no this would not happen just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys
there are lots of things in a 
these are just very few things that can happen
you can learn about or
someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday
she had the determination to succeed so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion
that is the way life works
homework can be made easier connecting with others is easier and entertainment like and video games are a click away
there should be restrictions against offensive materials
every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not
well if you ask me i think does
the phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood
for example everyday i walk the halls i over hear students talking about happen of the computer 
i believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself
she took offense to that
in conclusion the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness
in conclusion i think computer negative effect on
granted not all people did but that is because of certain variables
using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world
well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it
light instrumental music was being played
this method is widely used today in the modern world
this shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories
it is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time
parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children
as said above libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds
expresses his gratitude toward them a lot
maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist
cousins and i rarely see one another but computers make it possible for us to stay connected
he calmly sat there answering their questions with such a patience that i was flabbergasted
this is where people bully kids over the internet
my hobby has changed my life
this makes life easier for many people
i did not think that that kind of thing would happen at a public library but it did
if the things that are in the book are true or are in real life
those sites you have to use on
she will take the test again because she wont give up
this of the should only be entered by an adult or with an adults permission
should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down
it could be anyone
throughout the and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material
the next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us
a child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button
books are separated by age too so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate
first there are so many different people in the world
another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it
first of all
more and more use computers to get the information they need which could in the long run be hurting them
others join them after finishing their lunch
thank you very much
this reminds her of her old home watching the geese
when shielded as a child they would not know what do to if the chances came to them to do drugs or drink
a majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap
it changes from flat road to short rolling hills
was blessed that he had his house
there is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf
computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago
in the beginning of the trip the cyclist encounters a ghost town
children get so caught up in a computer game everything around them just disappears
she shows she is motivated in many ways
everything in life can have a double meaning which makes it easier to find offensive material
it can also help them in anything they want to do
men women and children crowded near the conductor for tickets
when people excessively use the computer they put their safety and well being at risk
people need to see how beautiful our world is if we really want to save it
lately a technology buzz has hit all over the world
there are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby
and because you can go on at all hours of the day kids can get bullied at any time
from the mans point of view he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for
some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family
as continues through the passage it says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help
they travel places with people at their fingertips
i know that i am always finding the computer useful
those other people would send it around and in the end it was a horrible mess
even if they are miles away you can click a button and have a live video chat
too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing
well from all over the world are not getting enough exercise because computers
for example i stopped watching the movie and i stopped reading the book that bothered me
censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect 
computer are all the time
for some people this book they will or have even read this book several times i know i have
if everyone limited their time on the computer we would all feel a lot better and be more social
so throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory got some water to drink and got new directions
having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends
the trip was very different from what he had expected
this goes for anything else like furniture instruments or even cloths
in conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit
so i will say again to consider my ideas
you will be amazed
i took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it
when i have to write a paper on someone i usually use the internet
energy he barely has
this cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing
censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of
i think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people
i know that when there is no one around i get scared
no matter what nationality you are you can get along with anyone
i once rented a movie expecting it to be a scary thriller about a killer in a trailer park
this can certainly lead to brain problems hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death
dear newspaper editor i think computer are a benefit to everyone
was happy for the simple house they had and was grateful
as the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence
my friends mother had enough and had to kick him out
also when he was talking about how thankful he was for what his parents sacrificed for him
computers can help with a social studies or a science project
that is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you but your family and friends too
they feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends
it might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it it does not matter
if libraries censor their books then other materials might start vanishing as well
all of these things should be
it is a new day and age things have changed from what they once were
your body need water to work right
computers are a learning tool
some people learn more about people from books
authors use endings that make people wonder so people think
once while i was watching the  a man said people died because of playing on the computer for over days with little food or water
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
if you want to get homework done and you have a computer it gets you off topic
when she says when the geese return their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season
removing anything from the shelf is not bad
finally is one of the most obese places in the whole world
it we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have  one of the most important devices
if we did not have phones to use to call someone
they both came to the and had to work in whatever job they could find although they deserved much better ones
are you worried you do not get enough exercise
the cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings
no people in sight lacked security and water also no buildings
do you see why the computers a good way of calming down
she gives examples in the story that makes many people get many
honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster
 but how often do you even see those people in real life
three features i found were the lack of the water the heat and the conditions and limits of the road
in my opinion there are some books that i could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons
now it is seen as one of the most famous works in literature
he read five books and only got a half a page notes for his assignment
so there was several moods in this memoir
some people think this is a bad idea but i disagree
this is so because he talks about his parents with a passion of love and respect
i believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf
it helps with communicating with other people
and his family cooks together which he really appreciates and 
and yet i was full of apprehensions
although some stories seem like a bad option it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out
financial and body problems like people do
music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing
my three arguments are they help your typing skill educational
we used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week
yes make sure all books music movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive
everyone looks fresh and is full of energy
if you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories
lastly computers benefit our society because they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire
no nobody wants that
this will help us all because we want to learn about new things talk to new people and see new places
over all in the memoir of the mood can be mainly described as grateful towards his parents heritage and home
water is a valuable gift of nature
for example if you are in school and you are deciding what college that you should go try the a great place that you can go to get information
i exercise enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too
in other instances things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed to checked out
no one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know
each person is different and people have all sorts of opinions on books movies magazines music etc
another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health
if you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn
how do you cook an exquisite meal
it would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties
we need to change this habit
imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay
the of is undoubtedly loving
people everyday become and being right with  so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines
when the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride
for example some are still upset over slavery and that happened over a 
she says i will take that test again
meeting people is a big thing
in fact you can communicate with multiple friends on the computer
because i only enjoy reading about the romance
a hard question to answer
it shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much
your friends be offended by your favorite movie or show
so if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book
this crazy computing must end
computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world
do you have a favorite interaction website
are of children who are addicted to computers
and they do help people that have physical needs
books and magazines are two fun things people love to read
and the country is 
while cycling you are in need of clean water
in other words censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in society
dear  i am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people
the hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future
therefore a book that not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it
in the story she says then i will take the test again
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful
in conclusion you can see how computer usage has affected us as a nation and in a negative way
families are seeing that the more a person plays on a computer the less time that person is going to spend talking to  or 
many features of the setting affected the cyclist
on a computer you can learn just about anything
to me the main source of communication is chatting online
there are ways that censorship can be good and some ways that it could be bad
can you picture person in your town blind and having glasses or even going to the 
i think the books should stay on the shelves
they would not have all of these donations
the cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water
some times she explains with the help of charts and maps
the mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author
i got the home work and got an a all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others
dear local newspaper i was reading this article about computers
so the only other option is the school library books
complaining is bad for business especially if its a government building
growing up as a kid i loved being able to go to the library it helped to enhance my vocabulary spelling and which i learned plenty new words
in conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried
par  this gives the memoir an inviting mood the author always had friends and neighbors over for dinner
the plant will help her past the test by being strong tough and nicely finished
if a child walks into the wrong sections there is only one person to blame the parent
the library is a place for all people no matter who you are how old or ugly
when colour enlivens our environment depression drifts away
you could instant message them
think before you do
young boys and girls also visit the market place for fun
if the materials propose things like racism i would like those items taken off the shelves
what does everyone else think though
computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather
sports are very useful for our lives
as you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things
therefore also few towns making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies
last of all computers are for our entertainment
the place where people buy and sell various things is called
computers help people learn about foreign places
the narrator is explaining what courage it took for his parents to make such an adjustment for the sake of his own happiness
i have felt this way multiple times
eventually his water supply began to run low which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed
rainbow is not a real thing but an illusion
relationships are suffering and computers are at fault
depriving them of actual history
so rather than studying for their tests they could be on or 
it could have some things in it that people could find offensive
with computer you will be able to talk to your friends cant talk on the phone
they help you learn more they are like and when you bored you can go on the internet
we should take precautions and do deep thinking
i came on family and many families are very close so its natural to be doing things with father or brother or whole or cousin
talked about her life as being very nice because grew up in a house that turned into a home
libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public
so a computer is a good invention

for example i a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations she became pregnant and it ruined her life

the short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill
another thing about computers is they help you in the work place

on the internet you can learn about anything and everything
this knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly

dear newspaper computers benefit society because they teach people
in the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men
we found that the computer manual booklets says to only go on for an hour at a time
this light helps us to study at night
also the beating sun affected him in a different way
the books and movies are also split into genres into which each movie and book belongs in

just like how they have an adult and children section

those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist
she told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken
some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children
computer is something people use to talk to people and keep in contact
that is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist
computers actually help you with sports in a way
this is going to be my first opinion
they do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions
the towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted
the mood created by the author in the memoir was simply love
after cutting the cake we played many games
also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overcharging by 
so the books and magazines should stay on the shelf
the mood the author created in the memoir is love
he is still honored for his three newtonian laws
its all media and entertainment
there even be a possibility that some books not necessarily just books hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to
computers are great technology but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives

the features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous but they also make him determined to escape them
offensive entering a you know your are going to find something interesting to readlisten to or even watch
it is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles and different perspectives
computer usage has its ups and downsbut my point is safety health and education one the main issues we face because of modern technology
or a worse one
seeing this brought back all the memories of her life back home  that kept her going

dear  have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button
censorship takes away the one thing a writer has there freedom of speech
these have been many advancements on computer technology and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it
the author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles
computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world
do you know you can enjoy nature anytime
i know for a fact us teens watch funny movies to make our rough day turn into a better day  well that is what i do at least
a boy read out the lesson
for example the author states looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
and all of them are offensive to someone
so what if a book found offensive was removed
the mood that the used in the memoir was joyful and motivating at times
kids always follow what they hear or what they see
at one point or another in life we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends
last but not least i am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising
another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness
going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time
computers are becoming a household item in the and around the world
that same day i came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing
in my opinion i am really thankful that we have computers
a whopping amount of use the computer for work
she got a we also be able to see whats going on with the and different place
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it
seasons change according to the earth’s revolution around the sun
this was one of the most popular places in the 
we all need to enjoy nature more
the snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape
in my opinion i think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves
libraries are many libraries throughout the that stock their shelves with materials such as books magazines music and movies
it is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely
just being inside just make you kinda gang weight
obesity is a huge problem in  five out of every ten are either overweight or obese
with this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework
censorship of music and movies is not right either
allowing a child not to read a book such as   is unpractical and harmful to the child
however i said that computer help people learn about thing that happen in the word
in the story he told the many sacrifices his parents made to give him a better life than the one they had
if few people disapprove of a particular material the book remains in most shelves uncensored
by me knowing that i am aware of the fact that children are not exercising
people need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time
also it is just flat out a waste time when you could be outside playing a game
they can have music movies magazines books and much more
magazine and books are the basics of a library
what i mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him
so in the other words the computer is useful for students
if there is an who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library
some people take romances being offensive or comedy or horror
dear newspaper i think that computers have a positive effect on people here are my reasons
certain materials such as books movies magazines and comics can be offensive to certain people
thing is that he was running out of water
this can certainly inflame groups and even start protest or boycotting it
computer screens are harmful to the eyes if you stare at one for too long
its like this everyone has their own taste on what they like
is only six about to be seven
thanks to computers i have that opportunity
you will become less active
as you can tell the difference in setting plays its crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply
the mood of the excerpt is very bright
i have to face this problem every day
there are ups and downs either way it goes
of complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house
their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason
society needs computers in order to look up crucial information
it take over your life
i think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it
if a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf
there will always be things that we wish not to see in life
by spending some time leisurely we will be able to prolong our lives and also be comfortable
people spend so much time on computers they lose touch with the outside world
these are some good pros
for example in seventh grade i moved from to 
why go out with friends when you can talk to them online
is very grateful throughout the memoir
our future leaders are already glued to the games email and instant messaging of the net
music is the number one entertainment people enjoy
this way you can save money and trees
the streets turned into small streams
most libraries are divided up into different sections there is a section for adults teens and children
the dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist
before computers were made all people bad was their family
this has a big affect on him because hes very thirsty
well in the library they will have generations of books on offensive material
this is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip
i certainly think computers have a positive effect on people
to wrap this up i would just like to say thank you having the time to read my letter
your family is going to be by your side no matter what
sale of ice creams and soft drinks becomes a regular feature during scorching summers
these two factors will cause major stress in you daily life
dear local newspaper i think that computers are a great thing to have
that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
many books are an authors experience so they are meant for high school age
there is a great heat in summer in india
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the setting had a major impact on the character
so yes i do their
next reason is to go outside you can enjoy more stuff like sports tag and other activities
sometimes we just want a good book to read
and then we have no nooks left on the shelf for any of us
it gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive
the hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again
this tells that the computer is just good at all
instead they could be going outside or even study
lets say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it
people think that this scene is to provocative and another person look at that and say there is nothing wrong
this shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there
sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk
he is sincere and regular in his work
did you know that anybody can view your profile which contains personal info
after time the starts to become worse and worse and the kids gain weight and keep gaining wait then become obese and unhealthy
my conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone
also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water
then different learning programs to teach us a different language
as i was growing up i was able to get what i needed done for my school at the library
this is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist with what i believed was my last burst of energy i maneuvered down the hill
they should only have books they want to have
it showed his small house and family and their interests and how they all acted together
and its something that would have to be done
when something gets a bad look sooner or later it will not be there anymore
also you can learn more about people places cultures and much more
these things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology
some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence
watching your teacher teach to you through a webcam
dear  i think computers have a positive effect on people because it will help you with interacting learning and coordination
let me explain more these reasons
also in the story he says i checked my water supply
he takes the letters and other circulars from the principal to the teachers
his music is just i of his life
reading books on philosophy religion anthropology world history and literature is my last liking
my favorite sport is basketball
music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone especially when it is only a way to express
so computers are a good thing and a bad thing
i would like to thanks all f the reader for there time and hope hat you all support me and my ideas
all readings music or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library
censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country
they even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away strengthening your relationships
computers are excellent for students that play the piano like me
also the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive
but he always helps the needy persons
what types of things do you go to the library for
without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have
some kids like listening to music while reading
there are plenty of dangers out there in 
it would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen
this brings me to my conclusion
now lets bring this letter to an end
an eight year old should not be able to go in and get a movie whenever they want to
your getting exercise  exploring nature too
but when she finds a hibiscus plant it reminds her of her homeland
so much color is splashed on all eyes and ears on such sights and sounds
helped the world to change in better way
also most of kids parents can contact their teacher and email them to see how they are doing
that is the mood the author creates in the memoir
i conclusion computers have a positive effect on people
information can be found instantly
so computers can not only be unhealthy but they can be deadly
the people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get there way at least in their community
of people who have to much going life believe that they
with the you could learn a lot
so if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards
books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world
after a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice
action songs were sung
your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward
would you let someone ban your favorite movie just because it has mildly offensive materials in it
we all want our kids to be happy
the cyclist had trouble finding water he needed and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions
second the computer gives the ability to talk with friends and family
they are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family
having family all around you
this is along the lines of personal thought
she is usually extremely bored so she goes on the computer and plays games and talk with friends
every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas
but you can highlight the important
in  this shows us that was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him
my friend barely used a computer and always played outside
the peacocks dance in the fields
how would you feel if you wrote a story about your life and someone found it offensive so the took the book off of the shelves
i think every one should have one
of all the recreations that men indulge in a morning walk is the most rewarding
next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things
in front of my house there is a beautiful lawn
coming from someone who does not particularly like reading
some of the greatest inspiration comes from music
also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed
another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate
it is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster
another example is the heat the location time of day and time of the year
there is no need to talk to a friend or family member online when you could do it in person
well many of us have
for example the family and life and even if you miss them
no books magazines movies and music can not be perfect for everyone
computers are advanced our world little by little every day
maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to do it
the features of the setting affect the cyclist mood and behavior
well computers benefit our life
where would businesses be without computers
if someone finds it offensive then they should quite simply not read it
that you do
also if you were to want to order some things such as shoes clothes perfume fragrances lotions and some even order house hold things if needed
take a chance on the computer stop the negativity and a pleasant surprise will come your way
will i disagree with what you say
in conclusion there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library
if they are conflicted by a movie they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf
the reader feels a sense of comfort
also there was no one around
books about murder should also be allowed to be read but not by children under twelve
getting more exercise could help you out in a big way because the less exercise you get means the less healthier you are
dear readers i believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons
ten  who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with same one a thousand miles  with no mail or telephone or whats over
he was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around
today millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage
in order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems
the response i got from those people were unbelievable
when my brother first got his computer he literally locked himself in his room for days
in the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive
the most important though is our advances in technology
the scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every shack or building he comes across for water
the person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more
in conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist
he talks about the memories he had there
you could be going to new place around the world
supply and demand
i know computers can help find information but personally i believe that books are better resources
with this power over them the people are weakened and often abused
not very often or that i have ever seen do the authors make a book to just to put someone down
how you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library
thank you for your time
in the class very few student were attentive
thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration
in the song it also makes fun of gay people
the last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl its significance
my neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as 
that is what he or she chose to write about
so consider liking computers
he reaches his school in time
google something like trees
dear local newspaper i think the effects of computers are good
i was very happy to see them
since they all can be found censorship in libraries should not be allowed
lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read
according to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him
the library is a place where many people go to learn
i know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what i have to say their will be no doubt that you will agree
is that the right choice
says about the internet site 
they would teach you how to type and take some lesson on typing without looking on the keyboard
if speed is what you need then you will look for a computer
dear  i am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on computer use
computers can also help people communicate with each other
a lot of it is especially not for young children
but using a computer can solve that problem
magazines help people keep up with news
smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill
so to rap up my thoughts and feelings
each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise
this is why computers are bad
sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change
so many kids could check things like that out and not even know what it actually is
she buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home
events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past
the people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer
the hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding
if this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge
in the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch
our librarian is also very helpful
the heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter
on time it might take your just over a minute
there are so many books and magazines music and movies to be discovered in this world
i strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group person or community
i think soit would help our kids and young adults to read more educational books rather than magazines and comics
when little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section
the budding of the hibiscus represents the time when shell be prepared to take the test
at the end the team with more points wins the game
many people are thinking this is a good time to go on the computer but you bored you will stay on the computer until you have something to do
they help people of all ages
you go and have many more friends which makes life in general much better
there is a lot of books in the library just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book
he had to bike many miles but he only had limited supply of water
now an you can text people right from your computer
computers are the future and its a good one
many people ponder if computers are really beneficial
music is especially one to do this
there every thing is so stereotyped
the only thing keeping us from pure evil is the and their ratings on movies music and television
you would probably get multiple answers to that question
so it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about
street beggars are seen everywhere in our country
an efficient man achieves some tasks within a short period
censorship in libraries and media should be abolished
i really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore
is for children under the age 
in conclusion the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the national park
with this the author clearly shows the mood for love and happiness
another opinion of mine on this subject is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library
in the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake
in the memoir it talks about making a house a home and a community your family
as a result that book was banned from libraries and schools
people find entertainment to movies with sexual or violent activity in them
movies this is a big one just about all the movies are bad
the biker said i noticed the terrain changing
this caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated
she feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her
all you do is type in what you need in a search engine and 
a teacher works to build our nation
books with a lot of cursing can be offensive to religions groups who are forbidden to curse or read curse words
library check their inventory and notice a book be missing but guess what by that time its already to late
people rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people
the land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation
some people go to the libraries just for censorship
however i also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain material
who is to blame
he also rides the galloping horses
with these computers kids with a parents permission can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place
so he had to work hard from his childhood
the flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments
is a computer going to benefit society or will they have catastrophic results
all authors write for a purpose whether it be to teach entertain or persuade an audience
moreover computers help with communication
the books are put there for people to read not just to look at
it also has a very loving tone to it
as you can see jobs use the computer
since the plant reminds her of home when it buds she will be more confident to take the test
i was having a hard time understanding the math
this is why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what could cause someone to become upset by it
for example i read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders just like everyone else does
from this snippet i can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family
but we have to computer become we have to because we need
personally i know that i go to camp every year and make new friends
how great is that
my second reason compute give people ability to learn about faraway places and people
the short story winter hibiscus is a about a girl who moved with her mother to 
it might help us make a better future
that is why i think those books should be taken out of all libraries
computers allow people online
they let us talk to people all over the world
if i am listening to music i listen to the beat and the words at first
even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people
how could a railway be worked without order
i know cousin just had a baby and her dad lives in 
it is not the library to blame but your own
there not a waste of time
i love being on the 
magazines and movies are the same way
therefore they inspire us
i grew up listening to several different types of music
people all over the world are vastly different
dear  having everything known to man at your fingertips
by keeping updated
the most apparent is musical instruments
you can make a difference in the way people feel about computers
sometimes life can feel so cruel
they can help you do anything
in the state of  about of people have a laptop or a computer in their home
emails researching questions on the world around us
this in return causes people to have better social skills
if an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library then any person could listen to it or take it out for awhile
the features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out he had very little amount of water and a long way to go
so being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make worse
by ripping our computers from lives of workers chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences
he is a terror to the bad characters
the topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years
the spectators begin to laugh as soon as the clown enters the ring
the plant will always be there but she has to look for the good that united states provides
kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way
we will always be in contact with the ones we love
i love going though the books in the library you never know what to expect out a book
if computers are so great now just imagine what they will be like in or years
clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child
one day my plea will be heard
that be it it not
you have to watch out for magazines too
some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact
teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed
the author chose this to end the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart
another thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your home town
also what about the kids that like to read
ever heard of 
lots of people own these kinds of movies
do you really think computers have a positive affect
if everyone read the same books listened to the same music and watched the same movies then we could have a very boring culture
the computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much much easier
many people do not realize this but at many libraries there are sections specified for teenagers
confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut
he says its his job
using computers helps society
now he just a nobody
that is why you should have computers all the time
she uses her cell phone to set an alarm
so after that we pretty much argued the whole time
it must be hard not being able to see your loved ones everyday which is why a computer is very helpful
its not like their being obliged by the 
between the and  doctors saw nearly a increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery glasses or contacts
he was born in india
with my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them  bad things
for instance somebody goes home and checks their email
secondly email has created a fast easy way to update people on schedule changes ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores
there are many reasons that book could be in the library
you can see the towns and so much more
computers are used at many 
you be small and fragile but if you plant yourself you can thrive with confidence
opposing ideas should be presented
 i believe that computers for now are a good thing for our society
it cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds not to mention communication
last it can help us do are homework if we have on it
studies show that out of students have computers at home and that person without computer access gets about of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects
the cyclist was in a desert
we the believe are children and adults are spending too much time in their laptops or computers
they were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot
one way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted
the reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument as people lived happily without controversial books
you become more if you go more it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids
some might find it offensive and others not
why would you ever censor anything in a library
if you participate in these activities you will meet other kids your age around the town
without a computer to look up for content things you have to go to the library and check out a bank
the public i feel makes a big deal out of nothing
other people will allow this chance too
in the spring the hibiscus will be budding again
his mother was a chemical 
statistics show that around of children under years of age are obese
sometimes little kids read books whit bad and offensive words
when on the computer there is no enjoying the outdoors
online courses allow an eager student to learn without breaking their bank or leaving their child if they are parents
at the end she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding
second example is students and their homework
you should start to check there homework instead of them just going on there and forgetting all about there work life i did
the last thing are pictures and scenes
kids think they are immune to getting in trouble while posting messages or putting up picture of themselves
young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do
if they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay
deciding to face the consequences of my theft
when in reality members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy
yes but at the same time it is up to you the reader to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable
this is terrible and should stop going on
that can advance the knowledge of citizens
i think there is also an issue with computers
also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings
the story is about a runaway named  and a runaway boy named 
it would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer
statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the 
computers can be very they resourceful at 
he passes through still with a level head
we do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read
she can get better so that this time she will pass
now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them
in truth by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left
a computer around is easier for school also i remember one time i had to write a page paper for and it was due the next day
if i was a administrator in a i would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express
that is why i do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries
when i was  my friend move to 
it also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in 
so though you think computers teach no they can coordination for the rest of a persons life
the mother was also able to overcome some obstacles
when having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas
it always is a terror that falls violently
for example companies that mass  produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker
it is just a way to make learning fun for young kids
however computers also provide surfaces for those with medical needs
if you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries how would you come about this
going on the computer all the time can became an addiction
secondly you can search the web for research
students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed so they feel the need to do things to become noticed
all of this talk about computer being bad for society really got thinking
therefore i urge you to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time to make it known to everyone in the city
my next argument against computers about our bodies and minds
the features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist
yet he continues on and then says what i believed was my last burst of energy i was going to die
when you can talk to people from around the world
this is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration
laptops have made it easier to block people out
overall think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome
we have to ask our selves these questions
you can learn about other places and cultures
i believe they will be in all of our homes
if you ever wanted to go bowling but you never had the time you could play a game online
they should just be put in their own area for adults to read only
those are my opinions on computers of the good an bad ideas
in conclusion the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir especially when he is describing his home
they threw water on the rising flames
most people use computers effectively
no book should be taken off a shelf for its content
that person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book
we enjoyed every single minute we spent
remember the words of shakespeare
of the people who use computers are obese or overweight
they have the right and freedom to not pay any attention to it
this is an understandable point but who is the government to promote only what they want to promote
sometimes they get more than the persons who earn their living by doing hard work for long hours
and last they help at school or work
i could not ride many of the rides there due to my size
you can find information on almost any topic
i however believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth or adults
so he is on his way to the nearest town which is miles away and he thinks he can make it
people try and do the littlest things and they try and make a difference in the world
its not the computers fault
inflaming the public is not what you want young authors
everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either
if i am at the i will always look for a book interest me
the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert considering it was so hot
the problem is that with all of this and knowledge there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up
if you go computer dead then it will slowly start to take over our lives
teachers immediately you have to talk to a supervisor about 
computers are the wall between inside and going outside in back at the world
you know why
he never comes late to school
why should we have to suffer anymore with uncensored books at the library
not only was it rolling hills it was also getting hotter
he could only go 
letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly
it is very addicting
a kid walks into the library up town
options and abilities to use
however others feel they are too consuming
computers can also be dangerous many people will get addicted
and were you can buy the crap to make them
if computers did everything for us would be mindless slugs quick
from my data that i have collected computers are both somewhat good and bad
statistic say the to of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids
a library is suppose to have a variety so anybody can find a book they would like to read
she concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now
was what met him there
i think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one
people have died because they spent too much time on the without eating and sleeping
they provide us with entertainment an easy way to interact with people and a huge source of information
he entertains the people
once i found this out i asked mother to please take it back
people need more time to interact with their family
sure there are cellphones and other helpful electronics but they always prove trustworthy
everyone finds themselves quite fond of a certain genre of music and most of the time sticks to it
we witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to
the first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride
they could play a board game watch a movie and much more
last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet
but then i got a and found her on there
from my point of view time is a big thing
young or the section is for mainly the teens
this whole journey was all mental
for example my friend stay on the computer more than hours
but i do
creates this mood by being grateful to his parents welcoming family in their home and celebrating their traditions with their family
from my own experience people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period
i have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended
a great example of this is the series
another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader
this is one reason why our public library should not have rated movies
imagine that you have a relative who lives a great deal of miles away from you and its too expensive to call or fly over there
the mood is of kindness too because he thinks his parents are kind for letting anyone into their door
also growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot to being a famous fashion designer
lets take a magazine for example a magazine has things that talk a lot about sex drugs and other things related to that
if we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives
these are all great ways to use computers
computers keep kids and teens entertained
if it does happen we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge
she will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later
first people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family
but i say different
one of my favorite series is the series by 
everyone should have a computer in there home today
why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday
i should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in 
spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body
best of all you will be able to talk to your friend and family online
dear newspaper  i think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days
as most of us knows fresh air is good for us
in conclusion eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all especially children
here is a short example
sometimes people who we love have to move far away from us
most of your day should not be on the computer
to me she sounds like a brand new person
if she believes in herself shell be able to get situated in this new place
also being on all of these websites and more try to give you things
when i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind
it is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it
he feels relaxed because he is at home with the water and the pine trees
for example would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us
why not learn from them and reflect
but to some the effect its giving on the people is negative
going on the computer is addicting
libraries need to realize that
the library should always have a large variety of different music
the technology of a computer is farther than any other item
a book is a form of speech
we should help to educate and rehabilitate them
thank you for your time
with some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across
also in libraries there are a ton of music movies and magazines
nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library
censorship is a growing issue in the 
for me i think it is
this helped her learn to type
eventually they all will start coming down til there are none
and sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older
being an author you have the freedom of speech you can write whatever you feel like writing
the cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced
it ended up being scary for another reason as multiple uncensored sex scenes were displayed throughout the first couple minutes of the feature
today there are books on almost any topic anybody could dream of
an author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders
in fact i have never seen a child in the adult section of a library
and those were for specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir
later on when i grew i was turned out i became a street dog
at times it is contributory and times the entire expenditure is borne by him
get outside have to conversation with a friend and internet with your family
would have gotten a  for the project
why would you travel in a place is you back
i myself read almost just about everything i can get my hands on and for some people its the same way
the author discussed the positives in his life
plus you even go to your friends house and instead of laughing youl say 
in a public library i think that all books should be there to check out
the ratings are from  to 
if students go to school and they are in high school they pretty much already know what is going on around the world
eventually there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another
this is where you could write something down in the computer send it to anyone and receive a reply within seconds
clearly the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist
these things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger
the facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences
communication plays an important role for a civilization or society
listening to music on the the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well
letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous
if this was done everyone would have a book to read a magazine to look at music to listen to and a movie to watch
many people work long times and spend too much time on the computer which takes time away from interacting with others and that should be more important
he talks about how him and his family used to come together and have meals as a family
but if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects they will learn the hard way
do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group instead go to the place that looks like you belong
many people were family to them
the schools and ask them questions
your computer must have the right specifications to play it
by just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side
you tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children
he is seeing it in a book so why not try something in a book
why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated
do not let libraries censor books
the computer lets you interact with other keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope
my father went to drop them back home
why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read
dear  i remember when i was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves
and search information in just a couple of clicks
he is a true friend and a sincere guide to the students
when shes willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence
that was one great comment from time
so as you can see that why i say you can through the computer
you can print pictures and find information
these ways are that he is running out of water he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on
a magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it
in the excerpt the mood created by the author is love
there just trying to say that it means more then anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered
we call them desert
so should offensive materials be removed from the shelves
especially if it is by their favorite artist
so the computer actually helped with real life activities
in that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about
first computers are a learning resource and a way people stay updated with the world around them
at the end of the memoir the author went back to the present talking about the past times
but censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone
of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the  or the 
as i stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement
people catch parrots at the young age
on a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends
to begin the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles he did not see anything in sight
many people do this in their spare time to try and set up a reunion with people that you know in middle school through college
the author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had
some reasons why i think this are school work and business stuff
things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others so keep everything on the shelves
as a member of society i knew i would not want to read something not typed anyway
in a harder way
keeping in contact with important people or your friends is a good thing
however there is no better website with all your friends on it
this is not safe in any way
he grows different types of crops for us
the effects that i have on computers are good
the final paragraph seals the deal as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about
the computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can stay in touch
where there are chat rooms were they can interact with others

especially being that children are steadily becoming obese and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable
they can be seen selling their eatables and tempting the hungry disgruntled people
the author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder

these criminals prey on kids
libraries banning books music movies or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests
a social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see
she refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is
it is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land

after all the materials they see read or listen to is for their own benefit their own learning and for their own entertainment
probably not will that computer game running
technology is continuing to grow and it is becoming to impact our lives more and more each day
i be angered by what i see
the rush of water demolishes and carries away the houses topsoil men and animals
also it has many website like  or  that let you interact with friends
are many reasons we should not censor public media
i say if you do not like it do not look at it it is simple as that
taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well
the time has come to decide
there is different reasons why there are certain books music magazines movies that offend people but it also has a significance
well good for you mission accomplished
getting rid of a material can lose someone information about whatever they are researching
the hibiscus is keeping her from giving up
so all the people of keep your computers they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology
computers have of folders and programs to store information you need
there can be different censorship on individual people too

determined new beginning symbolism each are reasons why i think the author concluded the story with this paragraph
you can buy many things on the internet the clothes on food
ever wonder what causes people to do it
we should have an understanding of the bad things in life
a might be tried of hearing about all of time and might find offensive when a girl compare him to or 
the education is just for adults kids can go online and research history of different places they live and want to go
on the other hand young children are in need of censorship
the show you how to get to a certain destination
computers allow you to interact with them with webcams
they are not required to look at it so if they do not like it then they do not look at it
in our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere all of these cultures came together in great solidarity  friendship
also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves
the other part of the day they should be outside walking around maybe playing with pets children or friends
everyone has an opinion and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing
there was no one in sight not a building car or a structure of any kind
this is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person
he often invites his patrons and donors to visit the home
computers help everyone a lot
there are some weak boys and girls in my class
all of these things can give wrong ideas to our children and teenagers
the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one
everyday i spend at least our writing something up for school
some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse why take that away from them
its hardy and comes back
one great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others
first there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library
questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises
for some this is their only way of communication
a cyclist is affected by many things when riding most being features of the setting
in conclusion the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it
the mood is love

one way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account
i would always be honest towards my duties and hard working
exercise is important to your body and computers are not
to talk to people far away is better to talk to on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other
out of people say that computers take away from their family time reports family 
computers are great and you should use it
these books do contain language that is not appropriate for children
 and what we read in the magazines  have a big affect
in my opinion the computers could make that room a little smaller
they could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry
this is much easier than calling the person
if the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor
it was not easy to learn
they read newspapers and magazines
the weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable
the people who want to see the latest movies that just came out are usually going to see some type of violence
she took it with her everywhere she went
dear newspaper i think a computer is not something bad for you
primary ones include the ability to exchange messages with friends and family help in the medical field and expansion of knowledge
computers also great way to communicate to people no matter how far away that person is
censoring books at a library is pointless you take away options and the experience to learn from certain books
the author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows by spring she will be ready to retake her test
i spend at least half my day staring at a screen when i could be outside walking my dog with friends
the cyclist thought he was going to die
in the end a system that caters to the most sheltering of parents is the best one
the next point i am about to say shock surprise or scare you
a lot of their family lives close by and they often spend time together usually for meals as it says in paragraph 
computers allow you to interact with people far away
also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web
or not harmful
you could be outside enjoying nature playing sports or traveling
in the obesity rate has reached an all time high of 
that is how the area the cyclist enters affects him
without computers people could not learn
this one she can actually call home
some people even on them to stay in touch with family or at war
we had to leave all of our family and friends behind
the computer is not used for just communication
through the computer people are able to send messages to each other
studies performed by the know that of child who play computer generated games are overweight
my second reason is when people have nothing to do
these are the books i remember
the setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions
it was very entertaining
i think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored
if every parent had the right to get a book banned there come a time when no books meet the approval of the parent
they will stop inviting you places
but it is true the opposite way as well
i actually think its a good idea about people being on their computers
obviously nature is ignored by society because of computers
some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves
a guest is a person to be honored and respected
what do you think
not to mention it would bring people closer to one another
it would be a lot easier than driving over to the persons house then driving driving all the way back
in conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope
in a recent report the states that in the past five years the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled
money weight and sleep
exploring the internet is what a computer can do
which raises the question who is to blame and what is the solution
it can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams
sometimes there is even a snow the experience of being there
it was my eighth birthday
to block any part of this experience to block our full potential
i actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf
a survey done by the  showed that of between ages are overweight because of their computer use
last but not least computers have a great effect on a majority of people
buying books that you would like to read can get expensive
so take them off the shelves
to see such selfless act is just wonderful
the they want to
however we can also improve and learn from them
through text or videos online communication is a great help i my life and the lives of my peers
do you agree that computers take over lives
dear local newspaper the effects computers have an people are not good
for example computers
i sow seeds in the vacant space and water them
just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back
just because i agree with something do you have to agree too 
google is the most common thing that everyone uses
computers have a positive and helpful effect on people
one thing that a computer makes easier
censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today
everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read
the author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too will get hers
in conclusion the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of the hibiscus
make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about
what would be the point in a library if you can not have certain materials in side it
the author would not have chosen a better conclusion for this story
with the internet that project can get done a lot faster just by typing whatever you need to know
it teaches us about everything  everything
they fill our minds with noble thoughts
the first time she bought that plant it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there
you can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games
all you need to do is type in what you want and within seconds you have hundreds of different links for your desire
this expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him
another thing the computer can teach you is about animals
so the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers test
the setting in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed the speed limit affected the narrator in many ways
the only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet
plus on video sites there are comedy
being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand
what other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value
using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature
they are great for communication learning and shopping
libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy
so next time you have to research something try reaching for the keyboard of the bookshelf
also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime
it would be one without direction where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss
books are another way of learning as well they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it be
so cooks in a kitchen if too many spoil the dish
literature is written by the author for many reasons
this time could have been used for more productive things instead
also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy
to finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year
if its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent
in my opinion i do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read
company all over world make different computers to bring out new styles so people can like them and them
they have tons of games for kids and for adults too
i say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy
instant message and 
you can go online to purchase tickets
in conclusion computers are great machines
christmas is one of my favorite festivals
if they do not read books about how slaves were treated they will never know about the slaves
when i was doing social studies project i had to find out what the flag looked like
the setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist
they certainly take the best parts of online interaction and put them together
if we took out certain books and music from the library it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library
however they should not be censored just because they seem offensive
schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers
the writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph
the features of the setting made the cyclists journey even longer and more strenuous
that is why i go against taking books out that are not favored by others
my little brothers like to play shooting games on the computer they are only years old
no one is being forced to read a book or magazine watch a movie or listen to music
how do you meet people from different countries
not you should go to the park
some people say computers cost too much
but if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older
maybe the family can afford to buy a pass to the public library
artificial simulations are no mach for the real outdoors
computers have games for kids that help them learn and also people learn new things too
if you were head of the library what would you do
but what about us
all of these materials all children can learn bad habits from
everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns
i was trying to find a book to read for an essay i had to write
my own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for hours straight
here is my second reason
they both overcome obstacles
were made it so your basically always within minutes of a teacher
if you need to learn about the of  all you have to do is type in it
books music movies and magazines they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being
should be removed from public libraries
id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate
they are also good because they help you communicate with friends and help people make plans to do with friends
originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places computers have been proven to do quick the contrary
i say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance
having an age limit in place for this material is key so that small children do not view it and get the wrong message
on  i went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him
computers are great people friendly pieces of equipment but as technology evolves people are beginning to rely on their computers for entertainment
you can do almost anything
instead of going online get going outside
these are the things you should have

use a a real map
computers do teach you more things but they also have games
in the story rough road ahead the features of the setting affect the cyclist
at the first town he noticed a water pump but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid
all magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is
in conclusion the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
there is another perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away
that is as long as you are not on too much
even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries it could still be seen
so many stores now allow you to purchase stock on me
also the cool thing about a computer is that there are websites that let you talk to your friends that live near you
furthermore the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then because people are almost always on the computer rather than exercising like they should be
that i could drop from heat stroke
materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy not just to please certain people
once when i was visiting the library there was a man in the check out line right before me
some parents might not want there kids to be exposed to this
that percentage is expected to grow to in the next years
there are loads of harsh things in the world its impossible to just edit them all out
learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it
however a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial
more people get offended by lesser things now
i support the advance in technology especially in computers
the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain
i just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book novels poems etc
through the knowledge of this hunger i was able to start a fundraiser at my church
when the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life
you can lose your real friends
libraries should just stick to the same old same old a section for kids with kid books
the police came and made a thorough search of the house
books are the world to most people and without them those people would not know what to do with their lives
even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice
computers are going to be around for a long time and when they die down it will only be because something better came along
it has two big headlights
this are the reasons why i think that censorship is not right
dear  more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
that includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them
all she needs is time
that is one way our sex offenders get a way around
during all of this i was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at
what does the word offensive really mean to a person
would you want your six year old girl picking up an adult violence movie sexual content movies or even a with cursing in it
all they are about is chicks and of course the computer
i hope you take this letter consideration
if someone does not approve of a movie or something they can search another shelf
until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair
schools should use computers because its the best way to get the information that you need to do something
i have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers
most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another
do you know that square box with a screen on 
i believe that people spend too much time on the computers
i can find out what is happening where i live by looking up your newspaper
this is opinion why computers are benefit for society
the mood in this memoir changes throughout the story
the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail
you can also learn sports and games
dear  glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society
because theirs always some one out their that likes that one book that you might want to throw away
his appearance too is very funny
every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to
i just think that is not a movie to let kids watch
come on did this change your mind yet now
my third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer
this could symbolize a decision which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip or perhaps the decisions he had already made
so ya the are good
without this right no one would be able to express their views
the computer also has lots of music that you can listen to
someone out there hates this book and hated it from the day it was published
there are several features that the cyclist encountered and all of them affected the cyclist
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
please continue on to learn about how we should use the computer
therefore why censor
some houses are made of bricks
adults need to see what there kids read this days
they can have a really good meaning behind it
and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on or break
that is how this memoir makes me feel once i read it
many people use this device to book vacation talk and build relationship people and to discover new ideas the world have to make the disagree strongly
when you are on a team and exercising you will learn life skills
to sum it up computers allow you to learn about far away places
dear  computers are an amazing piece of technology but some people are beginning to abuse the 
about of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long
have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked
dear local newspaper i agree with the experts in people staying on the computer to much
we can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer
i soon became depressed
if you have a computer then that is great
also the terrain was not good
the most you let your child watch is 
nobody wants to read lies do they
some of the books that are banned could relate to someone and touch them
i say this because what be offensive to one person not come close to being offensive to another
even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects
therefore the setting does affect the cyclist
these are all the things that computers take away from people
they need the computer for that task
it is a rich source of calcium protein fat and vitamin c
teach your children to be careful in what they read
i used to have a very close friends but after we switched schools i never heard from her
there once again he is thanking his parents
bringing it into your room and shutting the door is the most common way
in addition to this of teachers at believe that computers can be used as a great tool to help students learn
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
books are here to enlighten people and let them experience something they never would have been able to on their own
here in we have the right to sayread and write what we wantabout anybody or anything
have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about
the materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them
but some policemen are very honest and polite
even if you choose the wrong choice you will learn from your mistake
the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort
please when you are writing you article before and listen to my facts
its a library they are going to have a bunch of material
so you see computers are not that bad
i joined in and we chatted until 
although you spend time on the computer you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature
however book plays a major role in the cannon
virtual people are not your real friends and family
it going to stop whatever we do
plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books then they can monitor that themselves
they should be locked up
there are a variety of applications that you choose from and they are all easy to use
finally there is an amendment in the of for preventing censorship
the offensive things should be taken off the shelves
now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world
i cried the first day he moved
fish is her favorite food
my point is that with computers finding information is fast and easy
two days ago i did a video chat with my grandparents back in it was great
as you tell i am against censoring our libraries
to me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended
so for his birthday i decided an getting him a computer
just remember though if you agree with this then
at the end of the essay winter hibiscus by ho it ends in a positive manner
i have my own state of mind and so do you
do these titles sound familiar
on the website you can talk to your friends
so what if all the non sense things have caught your attention
now says this about his house because his parents were always so up beat and caring that they showed him what love is
without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways
second here are some dark secret of the computer
i was so happy cause when she moved i thought i would never talk to her again
so explain in your next article that we need our computers
it is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing
all the teachers in my school are hardworking
i should i tried it before
was happy that his parents that his parents left everything for him to have a better life
secondly using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier
you can surf the internet talk to people and much more from the comfort of your bedroom
just have to control yourself
and finally help with schooling
it is a lovely thing to be perfectly loyal to a friend
you can change the colors font size and font style on 
so you are probably wondering why they are even on the shelves right
but people do not use water sparingly
and only occasionally would he get an or two from his asking how his days was
sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies
doing that with their life
i have three reasons for this issue and they are  and 
if libraries were to start censoring their books then the result would be a small selection of drab emotionless materials
in spite of being rich he is not arrogant
they always had more then people at the dinner table and always more then people staying at their house
i think that organizing the books in a different way would be better
the author is being grateful here when she recognizes the house she has lived in the house her parents have worked so hard to get to
these people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day
she cant wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come
finally computers are a resource when researching for projects reports homework or anything else that requires information to complete
in my opinion i think that computers help people
the mood created my the author was happy
computers can be helpful and distracting at the same time
younger students libraries should be monitored even more carefully
this could help the people avoid such things
well people have the right to look at what they want to hear what they want
because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state
some banned books parents will look at and say  would this be banned
children all over the world read books and as time goes on our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels
are the words 
but you can get kinds of information from books
students use computers for information on school reports in    or 
but then looked up everything i needed to known in an half hour
some of the material in the libraries are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive
we lead pessimistic lifestyles
we need to keep all books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are
one girl sits by her computer doing homework
they be helpful but more hazardous
she said this because she was comparing her test to the hibiscus
however she was in a boarding school in while her aunt needed her support
it is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf
he relieved because he can get something to drink
i had even gotten some pictures too
is also grateful for both the personally  financial struggle her parents had to go through and braving the harsh northern winters
another cause why books or magazines be removed from the shelves could be that the send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content
the author talks about his kind parents and loving family
i for one do not like doing things if they might offend someone
these are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme
some students in the classroom at the time called  and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife
they have the freshness of a dream
i think it has affected me a lot today on who i am today
that line right there is showing love
but if kids are introduced early we would not have to keep it a secret anymore
items by using my coconut shell trunk or husk
there are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored
they help kids have fun with the games we can play
i know when i go i always find my style of music that appeals to me
also throughout the whole memoir you can feel the happiness when he talks about eating dinner with all his family members and friends
i hope you will consider my thoughts
the type of setting that he faces are steep hills speed limits that he cant exceed dry hot temperature and he has no water
they could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside
i like talking to people from all over the country
because he was running out of water running out of strength and running out of patience
why put it on the shelves of libraries then
people have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic
that is what i think the mood of the memoir is and why
the book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes
in one leg and he hobbles when he walks
while there is a kind of love mood here
you ca share photos videos games just about anything
they help people learn and makes work much easier
people are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested
another reason we benefit from having computers is we learn about far away places
then the cultural program started
in this memoir the mood sounds like a happy one
there are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not
there is never a way to know if its safe to talk to other people on the internet
she is only eight years old
computers are negatively affecting the population
this principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with
the mood described in this memoir is mostly about love unity and culture
he feels that he is at home even though he moved to 
he has to remain on duty in the hospital
for example lets say you finished watching a special on the discovery channel about 
i had vocals is a galore to deal with
so if every author wants to express something through their writing then why should we not let them be heard
there should be sections children teens and adults
if television was censored then people would not know to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before
at any moment anyone and everyone could die
well you do
computers are vital to everyday life and we need them
today is the day
this showed the warmth love and selflessness of the family
looking outside the window i saw snowflakes falling on everything
one hundred percent of factual books is correct
she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home
he has one son and one daughter
people should get off their butts and go
newspaper and readers computers are a very large part of our lives and society
the libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines
every day constantly for about a year i came home to on the computer and began my  as i 
no wonder so many people like computers
flip a coin heads tails  you pick heads stop surfing the web to get info on that place
people can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books
also it does not matter to me what kind of books they have in the library
my other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended
from the experience that i have had with books that cause controversy i have noticed myself not liking the book
for what i am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster
however are you really gaining any social skills by doing this
for many kids no matter what age they only rent books from a library for two main reasons pleasure and projects
when she was looking at the petals of the flower it said gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight
when she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country
what parent would want there child learning about sex at a young age
sometimes people cannot call each other because its too long distance
i think they should not remove these things from the shelves
i think that the internet is great
without computers people would be incredibly stressed and have a hard time making life easier
i strongly suggest you look over my terms
i make my own choice to not watch or those kinds of materials
on the subject you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation
also documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process
do you want to be that person
most families however do have computers
the computer can take us anywhere
they give you details on why to visit it and a fair price
they could play a variety of games
i believe that has a negative affect on people
a book not read as well never have been written
no one if forcing them to read them
this obsession with online games or is not what internet was made for
this is why computers are valuable to everyday life
the environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward
when you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you put it down or throw it away
there are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing
there are many programs that you can use to write documents make graphs and whatever you need to do
what do you want your child being exposed to
if you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life
the seating arrangement was good
schools teach children about almost anything does that mean schools should be shut down
the computer lets me see nature talk to friends and family and lets me see things like videos that twill never ever see in books
also the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy
for example not all kids like to eat corn
this caused him to become tired and frustrated
these factors greatly effected the cyclist
when i have children i will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them
the bridegroom was escorted to the thronelikeseat on the raised platform
the authors mood in the memoir is thankful
without the computer people would not be where they are in life right now
magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine
the setting is active just like the cyclist
what if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library
they turned a house into a home
i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
these are the types of mood described in the memoir
movies are a big part of life so i think
do what makes you happy and nothing else
but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted
but is also more listening to the radio online
this can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer
they learn from us and our generation
your family and friends have always been there for you
so thank you for reading my letter and hope you agree with me
it takes away your time that you can be going to the  going to stores restaurant the things you
many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in
i know that teenagers are on the computer a lot but if it really bother the parents why do they have computers in their houses
as you can see the setting was an area with no people and it was very hot
it is useful to interact with people of other nationalities
i agree that computers have a bad effect on people because they will spend less time exercising
in conclusion computers do help us from everyday use
one of them being freedom of speech along with freedom of press
there are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel
also if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer
many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular rather than just browsing
he describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting
books and magazines need to be censored according to there content
so i hope you understand and agree with my reasons
there is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced along with antivirus programs and other protection
first of all he was traveling in the which means it was very dry
the features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
when people bought his records in the  they had to be covered or placed in brown papered bags
its also takes you away from family and friends
in closing computers cause a lack in exercise enjoying nature and interacting with friends
he could or been sad person
if offensive material was banned from libraries our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world
from educational purposes to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life
the library has over thousands of books and movies to choose from
schools now do program called 
some with to become rich
another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children
when i was a child my mom spend hours in the local grocery shopping for food
if they learn from these offensive materials then parents should teach them is wrong and is right
i am not saying that this is true i am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen
you would forget to say hi and how are you to your family
an achievement technology and science that improve all our lives
and to get good money to make us happy
of population teenagers have  and chat
additionally computer games can improve reflexes
is a form of where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings
i have seen people classmates in particular that do not desire to read because they feel that a novel has offended them
and all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another
for example when i play games in the computer hand are the ones doing every thing for me
this ruins many peoples social health because the more they ignore their family or friends these people will stop trying to interact with them
it comforts me knowing everyone is happy
some books are racist of and for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks
the problem is not many people do that
she had no problem going off and complaining i can remember her every word she said it sounded like this
the children rush out of their classrooms
try and see if you can find the first ancestor of your family
everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books
the doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was in a way in two places at once
people have different views believes and religions and books on these might be offensive to some but the life style of another
you can download videos print out photographs and charge and other electronics
also do you know it was offensive to them are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book
some teachers including my own  have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings
just because someone finds something offensive in a written work does not mean that everyone else will too
is it not cool anymore
you can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine
the computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities
i remind you a library is an invaluable resource
that could cause them not to like white people
the road changed into rolling hills
we packed a small bag and went to the airport
this could also cause a problem because he cant renew his water source which means he has to conserve it and cant use as much energy
there are thirtyfour classrooms
he then goes to the computer lab and finds it on like that
computers already have a bad effect on people all around and just think about what has just been mentioned
many people use computers for different reason
there is absolute peace without the noise of motor horns and hawkers
i think the use of computers is very good things in the present day 
did he 
we cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship
some people listen to certain types of music to calm their nerves down
as a whole computers have a huge impart on our countries technical skills
without physically bringing your textbook home you can view the book online
here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing
i think that its cool that you are playing the exact game with another
many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories
whether your at your house or on the go with your laptop you can talk to people all over the world
life is easy a false statement
we have a freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others
i believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society
researching for a class and making a project
i believe that their are lots of resources
that i have met them i am able to stay them through the computer
in the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test
he is like a friend and guide to the students
he reflects telling myself that of i could make it that far id be 
videos are great when your bored
magazines and other things should be kept away to where only adults could get to them
many people can say they have
or they could go put something up and make it where you know whats over there and if you do not like then do go in
lastly if you really want something or need it just shop online
or tag or just running around
they would let people stay at there house if they needed help or if they had to rest
in conclusion to all of my facts computers are good
since then he was also called the enlightened one
these are pieces of evidence that describe the mood of the memoir
so if is something out you don believe in stay away from it and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it
dear local newspaper
as with some parents they have their own rules
people have become addicted to computers
i always missed the tennis ball in matches
there are many reasons why i think that those books movies music and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries
for example flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
the paragraph tells how was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she toke the test again
books are essential part of life
this made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water
traveling is such a without a computer with out it you have to go to to buy tickets
what did was instead of trying to deal with the picture she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures
what would i read
there is just to name a few
having computers it absolutely helps us learn whatever you needed to learn a computer has it
never the less the is the most watched event in the world when it comes on
if this continued we would have no books to read
computers televisions and radios have made life more pleasant
because she says when the snow melts and the geese return
this the mood of family
for example think about google earth it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world
that idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out
computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature
i think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed
the answer to this big question is no
as he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face
and you want to talk online with other people
his report card is unbelievable
it brought peoples attention to recent happenings
having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person
so are you going to let technology pass you by
however computers benefit society because they life easier now a days
we should not throw wastes everywhere
many of these features affect him in a negative way
might take a while but over time people get the hang
others find the book movie or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting
you can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation
she sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before
technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way
the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph of the story for several relevant reasons
know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries
these are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used
no libraries means no knowledge no books no life lessons no imagination and above all no excitement
that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
games are a let alone online 
i personally think that profanity is a good and bad i like it in music and movies but i hate it when people talk trash
dear local newspaper i support the advances in technology
when the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get
i realized i have been wasting a lot of my math homework time lately with those online distracting game
later this food returns to the camel’s mouth and the camel chews it again
in conclusion i believe that computers are positive for three main reasons
this fact itself proves our nearness to the animal kingdom or the animal world
when you are on the computer no healthy activity is involved
this allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others
movies books magazines and music can be offensive
there are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf but here are a couple of mine
this say is said but its not followed
then after that the main question we would ask would be  should we do next
i personally agree
that is why when coming to a decision on how we should handle this it is going to take much more thinking than a couple of days
last reason of why i think computers are useful is that they help you get a hold of family and friends
first the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water
oftentimes once he comes to power he is not the most popular of governmental forms
horse or the mule is yet another animal who helps mankind in more than one way
censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians
they can also read classics by great authors
accordingly i do not believe this way
in order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain
and then we have no books on the shelf for any of us
in school we have a lot of projects that we might need type or get a picture
without the internet i probably would have lost my interest in 
i think who ever gets there first should get the book but that just me
first less people are spending time outside enjoying nature
 are you reading asked mom
but what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family
its just apart of life
they help with projects and homework learning new things and communicating with friends
the mood is created by a description of the kindness of his neighbors
computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers computers are a good idea to conclude
they get to live in a house then 
but instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it
computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements
the due to lack of driving skills
i say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this stuff
that quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life
like if you were a student and you had to write a paper on 
i think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world
the people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece
this story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture
that is a good thing and could help people with everyday problems like  getting an answer to a problem and  work
food music and all
finally there are not any buildings in sight
though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful
there are other neighbors too
is now a size fourteen in waist
in the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways
 were you aware that for every min you are on the computer you should spend min outside
computers are very important to people who work with them
it is not only unnecessary but unconstitutional
that way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not
should there be censorship in libraries
talking online is very fun
people naturally type about thirty words a minute
a word is simply a word
that is one reason why children from the ages and up are obese
i just put that book down and continue my search
would you rather talk on the phone or computer
little by little she started gaining weight
and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered
they are electronic which means no paper
a computer can be used for communication education and for accessing important information quickly such as the local news
do not exceed posted speed limit represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist
movies that show war torn battle such as   world war  or world war 
all in all i believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see
in the memoir the author creates a sort of grateful appreciative mood
that i like
you have a web cam you can see family members from different states and see the face and talk to them like you are talking in person
when hot the heat dehydrates you
so if they have a computer they are able to do things play some games or can watch some videos to pass the time
they give people chance to chat with people allow them to make friends
this feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy
but the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society
now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and he can say the library has no restrictions
the valuable time of getting daily exercise is reduced you will not see your family enough and some of the costs are outrageous
we are letting the children of grow up to fast and introducing them to things way to early
the diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time
then we slowly begin to get unhealthy
the right to decide what is and is not appropriate for us should not be decided by libraries
not only that but advanced games such as of improve eyesight
some people find some offensive subjects interesting
computers can be very helpful to many people
also they can do jobs and processes very quickly which is important in the workplace
many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying
another method of computerized is my personal favorite instant messaging
it helps to make people more social by chatting with their friends
dear sir or mam have you or someone in your family ever read a book magazine or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive
did you know that of couples meet online
people can even order groceries to new house if they are busy
as one walks the worries and anxieties vanish away
when you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes
do you want a world full people who have their eyes glued to a computer screen
the internet is like a big book
you can pay your bills online or you can get a job online or even shop online
maybe i might want to know when was invented or if the universe ever stops
people want the classic computers but now they come out with new ones like touch screen ones
everyone can be offended by something so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left
these books are too old for a elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading
if you wanted to you could ask math questions as well such as what is the square root of pi and what is 
rice is the staple food in all the asian countries
they can tell you anything
he was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave
there are ways people can avoid seeing them
on a nice or day people should take this kids to a local park or pond
a computer is more educational than what most people would think
yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of any human etc
it is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment
that means you could use it for your home work if you need help
well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy
the mood in this of writing was very happy
computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable people to make plans with simply and effectively
she wants to take the test when the snow melts the geese return and the hibiscus is budding
but when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information
if adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer
this story is about different cultures coming together as one
this led to many bake sales and fund raisers
further more computers cut into quality time with friends and family
in the memoir gives a loving and caring mood to the readers
the author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out
he is very kind and honest person
he had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that really did look like a diamondback
the heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired
this quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men
apple store have when people go over and buy some computers
the reason the author of the story winter hibiscus ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up
as it is adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse
you can figure out what happened in recent natural disasters or how your stock is doing
in my opinion this words help bring the mood to a happy calming feeling to the passage
i chuckled checked my water supply and moved on
the kidnappers the sellers and the owners who make the kids beg should be given exemplary punishments
who is to stop someone from taking off books once this processes has started
he became dehydrated
computers are essential to our way of life
that is what people need to do not get involved in horrible things
if it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf
this go for children and adults alike
first off people can do things on a computer including homework finding a store and checking out traffic and weather
still they put all of these things in the same building
computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons
depriving them of how there use to be slave owners slaves and racial comments
you can get headaches from just staring at the screen for to long
by the time they get out they are broke
you can make audio calls to a person using the computer
this makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up old beaten roads
this can help for future researching and school purposes
have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is
the technology is there
when the goal is to protect people especially children from harmful material it can be used sparingly
another problem that computers give you is being non social
i got up and got all the materials and sit back down
the dry rough dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger but because of dedication he got through it
i love taking hikes with my family up a 
the geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in which she misses very much
also if it absolutely needs to happen each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about
also you can talk to people around the world
using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members
but there is one problem
dear  i have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had
my cousins are getting bigger and bigger
all along the streets in schools and sometimes even in church
dear newspaper the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend
the biker is being affected in many ways both mentally and physically
i think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books music movies and magazines
but computers can actually do the opposite
most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents
exercise is so important now a days and people do not get enough of it
there are a lot of disadvantages to computers
what would the world be like if children went around with these things
are there materials that are acceptable for adults but not kids
if they are in an area of the library that other people think is inappropriate for them to read go to a different area
libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously
more and more people are putting down their dictionary to type the word into  where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily
he started of determined then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated
they even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school
therefore materials such as books music movies and magazines should never be removed from public places
some things just need to be left in the past and kept there
gives me a way to talk to photos with and leave videos for my friends
in libraries there are a lot of good things to do rather bad things people always feel welcome there
they cannot shove information down our throats
did you know that of our jobs in the is mostly about using a computers
lastly i you sit on the you will miss out on the awesome life you were waiting for since you can remember
it seemed as if they had used up all their abusive vocabulary and were about to come to blows
at the same time i believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something
and guess what
these are some moods the author creates throughout the memoir
i want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides
now time to compare with your friends
how many times would china be in the newspaper
people would start to cut down on the amount of time they spend on their computers and start to live
and become skinny with no worries
i believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library
he wakes up again early in the morning and gets ready for school
for me computer games expanded drawing
one   and i were all going to work on our project
the biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality
note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz
what is a point about it
that is what has come down to computers
i know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but i think technology is ruining some peoples lives
when it is rape the juice is very smelling and tasty
teachers also use computers to look up information on a certain subject
one new message
so no matter what we should should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries
so yes computers have helped us in more ways than one
by this hes understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because hell know what to expect
the only time people see mirages is when the are hottired and about to kill for some water
please read on to hear my story
many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach
computers let you do so much to stay entertained over long rides or even rides
last week i had my final examinations
i would like to that the i for sitting and reading my essay
still even with this point made some not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want
computers in an life can help in the long run
the less time people spend outside the more energy is being wasted
some people are working all day leaving early in the morning and getting back late so that they rarely spend time with those they love
after an hour she took us back to the bus and we all came back to the school
if books movies and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now
if you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong
the most well know is the computer
when the librarian told us we were upset because us girls loved to read those books
dear local newspaper i just heard that people are spending too much time on computers than with their families and friends
however i also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students
yes it might take away times to do other things like exercising but we can find out away to do both
the world exposes certain literature to children and then is shocked when they see children in jails gangs and other horrible situations
so as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people
the variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular
i think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
guglielmo marconi invented the radio
this shows sorting like morale of never giving up
because children pick up everything they hear and see
if warning signs are shown then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed
i believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored
my first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily
history books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending
the government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive
the public is open for anybody to read a book
anything from to to country and back can be
it shows this in throughout the whole thing
this is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people
he also proven that since people have started schools the success in school grades has gone way up
computers help students do there school work better
the library staff could put those books in the alternative section
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode
the way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him
it would lower its popularity
because you can get it on the go
no opinion or view is right or wrong
i think this because in the passage it says i could drop from heatstroke
this is why i explain the mood as happy enjoyable and worth living
for all the reasons above are reasons i think computers are an awesome  and positive technology i mean just look at all the reasons
last year my uncle moved to for work
the survey would have a list of books movies magazines and music that people could check off
the mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad
libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction
those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist
iv went out the is another place you can check to get the weather and keep your family safe
if you believe that it is offensive to you then why are you reading it
should the children of today be deprived of the truth
one kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends
so not only does the computer help for diets they can help physical therapy also
our life will become very happy if we read good books
there are much worse things on television
people do still read or listen to it
to begin with censorship simply the banning of certain things that are thought to be offensive
he was the first president of the 
well with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button
that really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book and they could begin losing customers
for students it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer
they are the ones how want to go the rated movies or get a rated video games that have offensive language
if censor material then you are going against the first amendment of 
his work gave him a computer and he was back to tucking me in every night and he still does now
certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not
when the recess periods is over they get back to their classrooms to start their studies again
second it keeps customers happy
the mood created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community careful and courage
it sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people
but i would have to say that most people live off of or get entirely influenced by what they read or hear
everyone has a book they have read that does that to them
if librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults a lot of books will be gone from the shelves
children are getting bad ideas from books movies magazines and music
the magic of mutual love will bring boundless joy as love knows no weariness
nearly every person has seen heard wrote or said something that offended someone
they are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as war violence sex drugs and all sorts of other things
you can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores
considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water
sometimes it can encourage us to buy things we don’t need at all
when doing this you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored
when your on a computer there is so much to do so much you can get out of it
even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely
one electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers
the setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist
but know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things
that means that the day starts at 
everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it
i believe that each individual person is entitled to an opinion
none tried to stop them
next computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people
computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions
movies are a whole different thing then books
others find the book to be inspirational and uplifting and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong
so which one would we have to put censorship on
so we cant blame that
so what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info
furthermore for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message
they teach you how to use a computer
this is because he is sharing family memories and those of his home
this girl just failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away
dear  a computer is a benefit
in an ironic twist the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a factory that has been abandoned
millions of books were burned and hundreds if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government
maybe if parents would watch there kids they would mind better than what they do
for example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside
so i did not get that book i just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong
please take this letter into consideration
fire” i got up and saw our neighbor’s house on fire
the road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip
in the constitution is states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose
probably angry or upset
technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way
i believe that censorship is necessary in libraries because of the wide range of audiences the public materials and the opinions of certain people
trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
my grandparents came from montreal to attend my birthday party
some children go to the library without adult supervision and have freedom to check out whatever book they want
since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water
its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air
you get facts reviews about the place
people that act their age should be able to read watch the movie or anything just because they can handle the situation better
it shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands
what makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure
there are people out there who are actually addicted to the internet so they have to pay thousands of dollars to get back to health
also many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there
libraries or any place else
i myself have a computer it is very important and useful to me
computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was
just give the book a chance and see how everybody likes it
people at libraries fight over a book
i also think that there are some cons
finally the last reason why computers are bad is because they take away from your family life
with exercising can go outside and play sport such as basketball soccer baseball etc
what would you do
this shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family
a study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend
if you stair at something for too long it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because your trying your eye lens
also there is no one around to help him if he gets lost
what one person might not like the next person might love
people need to cut down on the electronics
so what if there are other people who would have actually wanted to read those books
your are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to
and look up place see
a good form of education is the exposure to different types of material
lets say for instance that they brought their laptops but for at their cellphones
in conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power
just because it is offensive to some others want to read the book too
he should have just left her alone
are students in grade with a grade reading level
other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by
i think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library school and even home
second the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others
my opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
you might not want to go to the library to find a book you can just look it up in the computer
for a final point i would like to say that computers simply destroy your lifestyle
as the winter starts fading away and the heat begins to intensify people pack up their woolens
i on the other hand think otherwise
you know people that like to travel to far away places and have fun would rather that than waste their time on a computer
within the each person there is a different color religion style and personalities
before someone decides to but something they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price
the mood created by the author in the memoir is love
this making it dangerous
the mood of the cooking family coming together and of the cheerful music is just great
we read them
suddenly i heard a noise in the street
no matter what there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials
next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs
my final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready
another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment
everywhere a person goes there is always a media source
i know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse
interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them
my first reason being socialization
the third effect computers have on people are it gives you something to do
they want to hear the bad language and see graphic gory scenes
everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny
the same rules apply with books and music
computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports
we have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library
he took same rocks and sucked on them he went over a bump had swallowed it
people who enjoy reading the books that are wanted censored would no longer be able to read those books
then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free
 movies anything you is not likely on a computer
families have been always close to each other
it would be taking away a right in the 
they just ignore it the world needs more people like that
this memoir has a lot of mood in it and it makes it a lot better
like the say free will
but shell be a different person also
schools also use sites to help students have their knowledge
would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication
very little people like being with the same sex
they are also far more reliable
take anatomy books for example
just when he thought he could drink more water he drank water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees
that being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves
even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff
also known that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author
trust them they know what they are doing
authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future
they need to go out and enjoy nature
in my own personal experiences i have come across magazines books and music that are offensive
the way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason
some people get obese by doing this
i personally detest censorship
the answer to all those questions is the 
computers save time and does a lot of work
finally all the children are getting lazier
not only the students but teachers too
i conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on
i know i would
its like drugs they are so easy to get
people were throwing water on the fire
it help you find in the computer about people
now lets think does that sound fair
she will take the test again
in conclusion people should have limited time on computers
you can just go to the beach or go to the gym you have lots of stuff to do other then going online and sitting for hours
incredible numbers of emails are sent everyday
secondly computers have also increased medical care and have been the cave between life or death
surely the effects of computers cant be good
if the parents explain kids will understand why it is not good for them
instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away
well i cant wait to see how the results turn out
there are also different genres that people enjoy reading
movies books music magazines and more all have there own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about
and that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork
now need on so can all up
the problem is that kids are not getting enough of the exercise they need
almost all means of communication can be done with a computer
also computers come with built in programs that can help keep track of you expenses
in this modern world seem hard for you to tear away from that trusty computer screen and face life
she concludes the story saying when the geese come back in the spring she will take the test again
i could hear loud roaring sound coming from the sky
this is first reason
the efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks
i almost screamed with excitement when my father showed me huge planes near the runway
in many cases the censorship of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy
it has gone from just being able to go to school to the various ways to increase your intelligence on the computer
like some books music movies and magazines
reason is because their grades get low
in other words why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch
well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies
if your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them
i hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy
such as falls rain forests etc
it also helps keep everything organized that way
for example flat roads was replaced by short riding hills as the terrain was changing so was his attitude
an example of would be for a sixteen year old boy
a semi hit him in the left side of his car
it connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are
so if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern and try to have something done about it
was eternally grateful for what they did
i believe that computers are a great invention
i believe that computers can a very great needed affect on you
last summer when my grandfather came to visit us he took me to the museum
so the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude
however many do not
a negative issue with having computers with internet certain websites that are not age able
i believe libraries should have all types of books music movies and magazines
you can learn things on them or play games
people should at lest get of exercising
it shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it
if you need information talk to someone or buy something its got it
inside there were pictures revealed that my mother was not to happy about my brother seeing
have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived
many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this
my friend spent hours on those websites
all knowledge would be taken away
nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family
for this reason we cannot censor libraries
i have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away
a computer is one of the most important things in the average home
they should just get rid of the book or magazine
being made fun of hurts
my opinion on this is no
i like most of what i hear and see
in the story winter hibiscus the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh
overall the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey
finally society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person
about every two years a kid or parent could go throw a computer
dear local newspaper i think that computers are both a good and a bad thing
in conclusion i think libraries should have at least some censorship
but if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten
for example say you need to having to wait days for the mail
thus creating a decision usually for the parents usually assuming they are the ones to but the album or the music for their child
sometimes life can feel so cruel
it also says that there was always a feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced
so online is my for why you the local newspaper should agree with me
if you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to
this is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends
do you say to blame them
computers are essential to these people
besides making live communication easier computers also help to communicate news weather few weeks ago the the home was out
more and more people are neglecting to spend time with their loved ones to get to the next level on  wars
when i found out enough information i would then be able to find the ten year old
in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
i would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community
they can be down right mean some times
not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome
they make us happy made us smarter and make us a better society for it
i hang my head
dolphins love to eat fish
when you are on the computer
she believed that he would try to learn witchcraft
when people spend less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice
you might think that computers are helping society today but you are wrong
about of my class has computers
the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our  one being  
in conclusion people who wish to view certain material should be able to do so as i had previously stated
hope to talk to you soon
it gives you an understanding of how people use to live
the average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school
there are a lot of music and movies that are very offensive to certain races and religion
as you can see the computer has a lot of positives
suddenly he stopped issuing tickets and refuse to accept the one rupee note as it was slightly spoiled
we should always think carefully before acting
there is simply some material that is not appropriate for children and it should not be put in our public libraries
if you want to know why computers are useful just keep on reading
in rough road ahead
well think of that
all the neighbors are fed up with this family
you see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them
it helps you at work for a job and at school
no one can say what offends everyone
every day in the morning before school checks on the weather on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school
so then there would be no books left
every time people use their computer they put themselves at risk
as a student i will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies
making the public recommend the book and it having positive outcome on the press is the best an author can ask for
any game you can think can probably be found on the 
lastly computers lets us explore new places
people get offended by things everyday
do you want to spend on unhealthy contraptions
plus sex makes books better
one amazing on a computer is the world wide web
if you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends
imagine a world where we had never heard of or 
computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate
books are good to read
we have different varieties of rose and orchids in our garden
take rap music for example
i strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society
both of which he is still happy to have today
so if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots money
i believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe
i do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a  or if there is a need at all
the author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives
some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went threw
researcher say out of people say getting online the best way because you can see when the take off when the next also when to come back home
the author should never be blamed for something they wrote
that is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups
without technology things would be so much harder
books books and more books
this shows that kids spend more time using the computer then anything else
also research for school could not be done without the internet
be active and stay healthy
i am a musician
then kids start doing that on writing in school and most even know it
he also gifted me a new bicycle
can you spend countless hours on a computer
it would be very hard to do that report without a computer
the use of censorship in their society
these part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect
if you force something upon a society of readers then what will they have left for their own minds freedom
throughout the library there are many books dealing with past historic events
i feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though i would not like to read any longer
the theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home
they could go on the computer and tell their friend
dear people that read the news paper and that have that like to play the computer all day more
my mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to
libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves
when all they have to do is do not get the book think that others might like it or remember they are there for the readers entertainment
well while we were busy playing mom and dad were busy as well
i think that computers are amazing
those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world
should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive
you never know what somebody enjoys doing
although these are things that our country has overcome there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems
in cities like tokyo it is only at this time that the roads are not crowded
if people want to have heir things shown such as movies or heard such as music it should be appropriate
so people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer
shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will
often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that
before the computer age it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place
as the sun’s rays are so strong we cannot watch them
i know that i myself like reading books listening to music that has no limits
compared to an alcohol addiction about  or drug addiction  addiction is microscopic and not to mention not deadly
i think they have rights to hear it if they want and there parents have rights enough to let them
there are many ways to keep in touch with people over the world like email chat rooms and websites like and 
the material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age
more excited as 
efficiency is another powerful time –saver
with out computers we would have to wait in longer lines for what we want to buy
children do what they see and hear so they are liable to try and cop harmful things they read 
village are regarded as gentlemen
being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth
finally say someone wants to learn about for fun they type in look at all the websites choose the best one and start reading
with the internet you can use websites like google and 
also in cars there are computers to run just about everything else
in the memoir the mood the author creates is peaceful
when we look for information on the internet you would use yahoo google and other informational websites that you need
whenever i have the ability to use the computer i always do
this is because of all the friends family and celebration
with computers you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker
who wants to do that
computers help people create listen to watch and make music and 
also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise
that is why i strongly believe that certain material such as books magazines movies and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries
if you say yes i would like to no why
i think that some people are not getting enough exercise and i also think that you can get lazy on the computer is bad too
on the other hand there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies
they also be a role model which is not always good for some people
now in this memoir he express all and also how proud he felt about his family
it would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives
if is unaware problems can only be helped to a short extent
profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness
instead getting together with a friend people just go on the computer to talk
orange is also another palatable fruit
many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students
father asked him what he was doing because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter
there is good old fashioned music such as 
they are passed on shared and enjoyed by people all over the world
you have to look at it from their view
he is a very good athlete
could use it for the   and 
speech on if i were the principle of my school
no one would be able to read and no one would be able to express themselves freely
we need our information
his parents worked hard for what they worked for and no one can take that away
they diminish  so bad increases and the need for increases
i look like i am dead and dress like a homo is another line from the song
they help people in many ways
the geese represent the new place she is living in and the hibiscus represents her old home
with this thought i think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all
many magazines and books such as and books about modeling portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body
people should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer
some of us might prefer to stay at home
you are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books
books give people another way to learn new things instead of in a class
not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer
the author described the love of his family throughout this memoir and his friends also
music however can not be censored
this quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader
how can your music get banned in the land of the free
i changed you not
such as in to a 
in the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways
newspapers publish articles titbits and many other things
then they will love me
there are mysteries romances comics biographies and anything else that you be able to think of
do you see the difference
in conclusion i think the purpose of a library is to offer information
says  look i was only kidding with the girl she needs to learn how to take a joke
first of all the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier
finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online
they do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans
a teenager goes into the to look up a book they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on there topic
they would be able to handle something in the adult material category
computers are like a pencil to a student
with a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture
although this movie is about historical events it still needs to be taken off the shelves in opinion
dad found out about and he decided to try it out
i think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love
such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand he does not know how to learn
you can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse
either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book
computers can help people with schoolwork communication and entertain you in a safe way
this would result in a in high grades
censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views
with a computer you could do so many things
by these high tech computers we can learn about life outside like space and other galaxies
it is the idea family that fueled his loving childhood
a that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion
reading is very important for kids these days
the essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction
how fair is this
the time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not
censorship is a very sensitive topic
there is only one reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library
this knowledge that you always hide from them be what they need to know later on and wont know when they need 
computers teach a lot of hand eye coordination
they are useful because they tell us about the world
is this really worth losing your friends and even your health 
computers are a serious issue
thus the whole of the last sunday was wasted
the road was also rough plagued with many rolling crippling hills
if a book is offensive first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to
censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece
my aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work
i would like to say computers are not interacting with family friends nature or anything of that sort
the past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past
we all have the freedom of speech right
it started off innocent enough
how great is that
we all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive expresses some one else in some way
now and day people are using social networking sites like and to talk with people far away
so this is why i think libraries should be able to censor things
the mood created by the author  is a upbeat  happy mood
then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page
but a few days lapse may make him unfit for any cure even with costly drugs
it interferes with social time health and physical activities
i remember when i was in grade and my father was across the world on a business trip
when two opposing types collide a burst of energy is released
but important of all of it family that you miss can talk to you for hours without a phone bill
leaving options open for students is the best idea because more kids actually read
in the text it says i toiled on 
i hope i persuaded you on my position
some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors
know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks on us
the terrain really affected the 
that is why is bad to use a computer a lot i hope u understand
so i like to listen to my music while i am reading
but we can’t live without water
now what side are you at
often i look to other artists works for inspiration and the one place to get that music is you guessed it the library
lack of good food good homes and poverty are some of them
presentations essays graphs anything
but how do you know if people are who they seem to be
my opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer
learning about things you have never dreamed about learning
as you can see i agree that computers are a bad idea
in my opinion
but a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else
i strongly believe that they have bad effects on people
people should stop spending so much time on computers
also people will be happier because they enjoy travel
having a section in the library from which only adults can rent the items would remove this problem
then it would make everybody fit and health if they try
she was looking very pretty
they can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility
then why can’t he understand that animals too don’t like such hurtful treatment
help our world by teaching about faraway places and their cultures uniting our world with new techniques of talking and helping workers to have a better job
some elder people were sitting on the other side
or get email with is like getting real mail but from an computer
mood the memoir sets is a warm mood
after realizing that memories are whats important and seeing that flowers determination to survive a cold winter she develops the determination to take the test again
of people that use the almost everyday are students
this is why i think computers have a negative effect on people
one book about 
computers are good
this can also be used with movies
people are going to be mad whether they are there or not
people never want to lose relationships
this simply demonstrates the importance of serving our parents
computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better
if he were in the city for example he would not get lost and stranded and therefore would have no story
she pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable
that means that they want to be something when they grow up
there are many books that some people do not want their children to read but the books actually help children learn
she feels that maybe if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test
heaters irons washing machines freezers and room coolers are in common use
do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because contains one curse word in the whole book
i think computers is a big effect on people today and this effect should be solved
it will show that a large part of the earth is covered with seas
soon you will become fat
computers help people find a nice spot to travel
can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood
where would we be without them
take history for example
i will elaborate in the following three paragraphs
it gives me great pleasure
the features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist
many children and even adults are hooked onto the computer
books for everyone
these conditions directly affect the cyclist
in my opinion i agree that it benefits society
public libraries are just that public
in the essay do not posted speed limit the setting effects the cyclist in many ways
computers are useful to find information for school projects
you can buy house hold appliances
movies on the other hand create a visual image right in front of your eyes
yet if this is truly the case why does the censorship debate still rage
what you can even do is you can talk to your friends listen to music and do homework
a student may not like examination but he has to face it every year
first of all computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have
as he runs out of water the landscape and his surroundings start to get drier and drier
most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times
i think this is the mood the author used in the memoir
a household without a mother is not a household
being exposed to these computers are helpful
it also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world
libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired
the features of the setting affected the cyclist
we all have library cards which we carry to school every day
taking media off the shelves is not needed
i can relate it to a time i was played soccer games during the summer heat
he thought he was let down
it is simply a tough time doing this job
more family time can be but i think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising
and the library is a good way to search and find information about anything
a little while back i was in the library and i noticed a book that was offending
come on in to the wonderful world of computers
he than talks about all of the good times that they have and than he thanks them one more time
in his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on
some say it is a great idea and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living
this is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health safety and education
and those are my ideas on the subject about if people spend to much time on the computer but not as much time with friends and family
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
religious beliefs it or not be disrespectful
censorship can also do the bad things like i discussed earlier which do more harm on a child then good
when he crosses a snake it suggest even more despair
i see it both ways because its good and bad
one of the moods was happiness
i talk to my friends everyday on the 
dear  i think that computers affect our country in a positive way
one night my little brother came home with a book that he got for the library
books should not be censored if a person does not think the book is appropriate then they do not have to read it
for example look at the 
and how all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in united 
in my own opinion computers are great addition to our world
with this their safety is at risk
the computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular bases
how do you act and what should you do
i guess he is just very grateful for his parents his childhood everything and everyone he has ever met had or done in his life
think computers have a effect on people
second be happy from where you come from
the experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer
another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often
the flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on but as the road changes to short rolling hills the biking becomes more difficult
a street hawker has no fixed price
also this paragraph shows how the hibiscus symbolizes her
this is why i believe that computer you
i think the opposite
they are useful to us in many ways
book publishers put only what they want are kids to learn
about of all picture on the internet are true
others could be seen sitting in the classroom and gobbling up their food
it not be completely accurate
also the author credits the house with giving him a family
hello  you think computers are having a great effect on people
the terrain affect the character by keeping him determined
on the computer you can get any information about any information about anywhere or anything
afterwards she bought the to comfort her homesickness
his friends like to play with him
he also told me that the zoo authorities take care of the animals in best possible manner
and because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out
however within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get
said that of people that get a new computer spend minutes more than what time they usually spend on it
grown ups need them to work
this allows the reader to feel such love and happiness which is being expressed
dear local newspaper i have heard about this issue concerning people are on their computer to much
even though the right of removing things sounds like a good idea we should consider the thoughts and ideas of others
instead of completely banning some texts why not move them to another section of the library
the whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope
it is up to them if they want there kid listening to or reading material like that
you should have all the materials that a child should be interested in
computers affect peoples lives in good ways and bad ways
i think that computers help society learn and helps people to talks to others around the world
using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier but their is on even greater one
everyone has a right to read what they want to read
firstly computers help teach hand eye coordination
in fact nearly of people have an account on a computer of a public website live   or 
water of the ocean is salty and not suitable for drinking
also computers have a positive effect and are beneficial to society because they help you communicate with friends and family all over the world
using computers to type are also faster than writing a paper
finally she expresses happiness
they do have a profile which you be able to relate to but they could be lying
literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored
magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander
some people do not agree with most things but that is something they will have to face because not everyone can be happy
i feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world i would like to live in
however you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years
computers have given us to many part to learn
the main way of online communication is or 
as far as music and tapes go no i do not think that those types should be removed
a computer might save your life one day
i for one knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online
one reason that i support computers is because they make learning easier
the music and movie section should stay in libraries
the main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive
her mother has a garden and she relates to it in that she has a different past preferring natural foods like bitter melons over 
if a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate parents should respect the decision of this teacher
please heed my advice and use the internet and computer
they would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her
on the second day when i still could not ride i started crying
could help you out a lot
everyone in life needs to be determined
libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone
you would know what its like to be in war
first i stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago i had a social studies research project
it can be also be when you steal and say its yours
he was looking very handsome
whether everyone agrees with that is a different story
the communication is also great for businesses
on a computer you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states
in addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents
first of all we have the right to have these kinds of books
recently  the computer company took a survey to see how many people use the company for work
although on my computer i can actually see her on my screen
so she had to take it off
the author is grateful because her parents came to 
‘a healthy body carries a healthy mind’ is an old saying
there was an announcement
in addition to financial loss there is also a health issue
as you can see now computers are great influence to our lifestyle
computers are very helpful to us and improves everything about the way we live
i think all movies music and books are acceptable
it also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family
finally i feel that computers will day life
they have the ability in and teach us what seems like information second they have made the could a smaller place through communication
they have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games
it makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more
some people freak out every easy and this world is every offensive and people need to think about other people
you can learn about interesting people in history
it is all your own choice of things you want to read
all of these things can help you in a way
i wanted to so why cant you
the mood is created by his parents and where he lives
for instance my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way
features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates a
most of the time people are home bound but need a job
for one you cannot run very long you become weak and for kids you stop growing
this happens quite often and i end up staying awake until around 
also the air is good for your body
numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today
should i not care about what i am forced not to see
dear newspaper i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
first of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age
he cannot eat proper food
when someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take
but not all medias are good
he is thanking his parents for being brave and coming to with little and creating a foundation for their future life
the mood of the boy in this story was he was happy talking about how his whole family could come to his house for any meal in the day
without water he thought he was going to die
computers though not only cause safety issues but health issues also
and with computers other electronics can work as well
just as i would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book
i think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if you want to change them or not
stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come
all of the things that a computer can do are great
this cause an effect on that child and they start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing
if you feel that they are reading listening or watching something that you feel is in appropriate ask questions
everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are
no matter our color size looks or personalities we are all created equally as our constitution says
for every half hour at least minutes outside or with friends
they will experience these things one day and they need to be mature enough to understand them
fact children have more friends over the internet then ever
i am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised
based on the memoir the mood created by the author is one of friendliness thankfulness and caring
you can either email them or talk to them from a web cam
even if you were a construction worker you could your blue prints with pinpoint accuracy
how mad would your parents be
he was losing water
in a library no one can judge you for your beliefs culture or opinions
people just need to find a way to it out
the mood created by the author is very welcoming
i believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong
this shows the love that everyone has for one another
because of this it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions
so eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find 
i think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries
remember it will always be out there all we can do as try to keep it out of reach of our children
the dryness was a huge problem during his journey
the computer is also helpful for research papers
with different books comes different readers
elephants are very strong and powerful
seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer
she uses this plant as a tool for comfort to help her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher
technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world
libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area
to whom it concern 
anything as in research or personal reasons
 i strongly believe that we need computers
 should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
temperature terrain directions all gave the cyclist doubt
as for me being catholic there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that i am not supposed to read as a good catholic
the computer has changed society a lot for the better
if one is cautious and uses internet safety techniques they can make new friends with common interests through computers
most books and movies are filled with sexgang violence and drugs
the overall mood in this memoir would have to be thankfulness
while she was planting it she seen geese and she was reminded of home
the outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting
someone can learn about far away places by searching it up online
not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest
no piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world
i believe in both in a way
so how you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries
the days are getting shorter lets live it like
there are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else
so him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying
offensive thing can hurt a persons feelings and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book
the point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public
they sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches
of people nowadays have at least one maybe two computers in their household
also the features of the setting give him determination
many people enjoy books magazines and movies of this nature
they want to look perfect
effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight
it says this when the characters says
i believe we could organize our books movies music and magazines in a different way
should they be removed
they stop caring about school sports even their friends
a lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea
the condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist
a person who shows a foolish and carefree attitude towards life is often nicknamed “a butterfly”
even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness after she fails her driving test and is missing her home it is still a symbol of hope
all this happen when children are not being watched or get bored and to pick on someone
there was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back
i learned that when i was young just like most young kids have
the author shows sacrifice by showing what the parents had to give up in order for their child to have a better life
lastly it can even increase you chances of finding a job or helping out your job
when the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst
you can even talk to people online from around the world
but when in not doing my school work talking to my friends online
the second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring
a library should be a place of balance
the parrot is somewhat big
there are several things that explain why i think this
for example the author wrote over one long crippling hill a building come into view
yes and no some materials such as books music movies magazines etc should be voted upon the citizens to be removed from shelves
had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have
the morning walk invigorates body system
computers are bad for society
to much time on the computer takes away knowledge and takes away time with family and friends
that is bad that they would have that on there shelf just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to
is this really what you want
these are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late
it has hundreds of books
they always have a program that if you spell something wrong it corrects you
yeah those can be taken out of the library
he was worn out because the setting was so intense
this works for a lot of situations not just this one so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them
it takes risks to guard our house
the setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards
they can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain
i believe it should be taken off and there are alternatives to this
in conclusion i informed you on why i dislike computers
it is not a place for violence so quit with it go for a safer environment
i already know what the words are so why censor it
computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions
it involves the sacrifice of time and thoughts
it is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad
if there are people saying that the certain books are offensive then they should take them out of the library
many people would be made mad if this did happen
i hate moneymindedness also
they keep coming up with more and more
that could be a good and a bad thing
we need to be careful about what is available to us and to the rest of the world
jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face
i hope i have convinced you to see my side of the argument and thank you for your time
also you must have a membership to that department
certain materials should not be removed if found offensive to others because it might not be offensive to someone else that might enjoy it
my last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage
some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are
business and companies around the nation are relying on the advances in technology why change anything
if everything was censored we would really have nothing to read or to watch
ever since the  computers have been used as an ad for new information
some parents take offense to a show on the television because they don believe that is right for their kid to be watching
i strongly believe that all people should use a 
because the author is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her
store things on them and use them for entertainment
for those reasons materials should not be removed
another thing is that you could actually need your computer to stay
these hackers break the security codes and buy things online using other peoples money
if you throw the candy away what does that mean for the other party guests
there are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness
everybody has their likes and dislikes with music books movies magazines etc
the boy did not know how to swim
computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations
if their the age of fourteen and up then they can get a magazine
almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions
if a certain book offends you then you  have to 
so the mood created by the author was happy and grateful
although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication
it says working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength
the states that freedom of speech religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged
readers please try avoiding you computers for just one week and you can forget those jet plane
the biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope
a small boy had separated from his parents
these photos give children negative thought such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model
google yahoo and 
now i hear my favorite tunes
the bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily
i like discovering things on my own
one of them jumped into the pool
you can send information from one computers to the other
they had to leave their country their friends and family and they had to pretty much start their lives over again
these three magazines talk about how to be better in bed
i did all my research on the computer
he is also thankful for his parents love and sacrifice
it was a great occasion for socializing
as a daily newspaper reader i could not quiet my voice any longer
as you can see computers have a positive effect
so i believe that in a way an excessive amount censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing
we should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own
if you take that word away from the book you lose some history of the old south
you can get them at any ticket sales website
also they end up getting in trouble in school or at home
the computer is also a great device to use for learning
with very little water it is hard to stay hydrated
everybody would be the same then
i would take a wild guess that they are mostly about sex and violence
i read book almost on all subjects
the only time they let us stay long is when we maybe doing a project for school
you can also tell that he is implying that he loves his parents
his name is ram lal
the parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read listen or watch not a large group of people
she understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big here would be strange anymore
they could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it
not only children some birds also love to eat ripe mangoes
i myself have not come across any books movies or music that have offended me
unemployment is a great curse
i was so excited that i kept jumping on my seat
the benefits of our computers are they connect us the spread news and they make every day objects work
you need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out
he thought of them as his savior
regardless of how hard we try children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives
this shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him
this sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for
now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer
the flower was too much of a memory
he lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die
i think that some books in the library some people might take offensive
if i had a problem with the restriction levels at the library i just would stop going
there was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist
she bought a hibiscus and went home
therefore he was in trouble
computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring
the ways of teaching this are typing and clicking on something people when they type look at the keyboard
this tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion
it would make you anxious to read it
that is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis
for example when the author says flat roads were replace by short rolling hills that made the author have to ride safer
history has never been in the control of man
music is to be played through headphones only and must be at an appropriate volume
some people use the computer for there education
do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive
computers help people through there trouble
the mood created by the author was a warm and comforting feeling
if they far away
if people are so offended then they should just stay away from the books that the certain author writes
these type of stories are important for our culture to prevent any misconceptions we have or try to prevent them from a young age by shocking the reader
the charm is enhanced many folds
i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing
i could go both ways with this
the cyclist is in the desert in the summer time with hardly any water
they have books over everything
he also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route
was having so much fun that he lost track of time
for other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers
calling someone from another country on the phone gets really expensive
play a game like monopoly or play 
the other day i showed my mom how to use a computer and she said it was the greatest invention sense sliced bread
the cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town
because i have a choice if i want to watch it or not
this shows that by always going on the you hurt your academic skills
music is a great way to clear your mind and relax
personally i think that there should be a variety in the library
dear  you think computers are bad for society
this paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging
he was very happy with who he had become and how he had been raised
the mood created by the author in
we need to have the same aspect on life
i have named her birdie
like my mom gives me a limited the computer my laptop has to be off on a school night
with computers you can see the  the tropical reef fish or the at the
i know people argue that computers should be used less but could you get through a week without using one computer
not two miles into this next reaction of ride i noticed the terrain changing
many people need time to think about what is happening in their life and they cannot do this our internet
why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices
another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature
first off the whole setting was a dry dusty not desert that would chair anybody
have fun and learn lots
another thing they can do out of a hundred others is let you communicate with other people no matter how far away
they would do kind things for them
freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions
the computer can make you gain quit a bit of weight
you can talk to people on certain websites
i think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world
if for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter
dear editor computers are good for people because it really helps with they work and home work and other stuff
in my opinion i think the computer does benefit society in many ways
they wear new clothes too
everybody might not agree on different subject and they would want a certain book music movie or magazine censored
dear the people use the internet
there are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family
those types of things would offend most people i think but you can never be to sure
his troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp
people like the do not spend much time with family members or friends or even just outside
since some of the kids in my school who have special needs have a hard time reading
in my opinion i do believe that computers are good for you
this quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life
he almost collapsed because he is so thirsty
we just have to teach our kids what good and what 
in one case a girl actually killed because of nasty messages posted about her
also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period
music is something everyone can relate to
also they allow you to talk to friends and family over the internet
even so it is still on the list of suggested college level reads for classes
so it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it
for example the series is offensive to some guys and girls
the mood was calm as if it was a wonderful place to be in that will also makes like wanting to live their forever
shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his parents had to make for him
another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet
also  the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly
people spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside
people spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change
all people have freedom of speech in the and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive you are taking away that right
no it should not be removed
throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some
for instance most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world
by using computer for a long period of time you begin to think how computers are all you need
you can even do research on a computer that is why computers are good
his environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty
censorship is a fine line and everybody has a different place where they draw that line
computers are great for communicating and school work but when used in excess can be unhealthy
there is icon inside one of your documents
this comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week
however you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people
apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely
those book also have bad language in them to
we want to learn about the places so we can travel there
lastly they should enjoy life
i have a little library of my own at home
nothing but obesity
libraries is a place where all sorts of literature comes together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature
when she sees the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus
you can still interact with family  friends  can meet new people
not everyone is reading a book about rainbows and unicorns
two weeks ago i took my year old niece to our local public library to find her a book
it that his parents sacrificed for him
finally in paragraph six the author sums it up and tells that he will always be grateful for his parents love and sacrifice
they cannot take offense to what we have to say because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book
this is how the change of setting affected the cyclist
there are some material out there that no one wants a little kid to get a hold of
in the example i used in the paragraph above that actually happened to me
i believe the computer is critical for success and happiness in life
these places are called oases
so how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view
thanks to  slavery became illegal in the 
offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of
a library should not be biased
in conclusion i believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet
most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences
he works till evening
i feel movies should not be removed from the shelves
she is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future
there is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples moods
i think that computers are great
but then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information
and think about how much computers have done for you
would you want your children reading watching or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them
he was soon xrayed and it was found that one of his ribs had cracked
the man who cultivates crops is a farmer
who just wont to get on a computer and read a book 
the terrain begins to feel like more of a hill which makes the struggle even worse
she planted the plant despite the cold hard ground
one example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join
the magic of mutual love will bring boundless joy as love knows no weariness
my use it when people are hurt and i know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy
an you cant just take that off the shelf
no i would not think it would be the right thing to do
libraries do think about what information children view
the cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store
this is my view on censorship in libraries
music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects
getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books
the mood created by the author was a great mood
imagine how computers have helped shape the  do you want to give this blessing up
what do you think
we had our food which we had carried with us
so come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use
beliefs are important to people no matter their age gender sexuality or their race
you can also chat with people online
is excited that there is a building that might get some water from
she would adapt just like the winter hibiscus
though the materials found in a story be horrific to a parent it be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people
also the military  keeps secrets on computers but if your smart enough you can hack it
there is nothing in print that can not be conveyed in a different communication form
she vows that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again
the lyrics and sounds speak to many people in strange ways
these books were offensive
the increase in population is due to the fall in death rate
he was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die
the author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering
for example people die of
and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers
well i sure think using a computer has a great effect on people
a person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader but rather to strongly get a point across
the author created a mood of happiness and love
anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer
such a novel though containing offensive language at times would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed
the kids can look at this stuff and see violence
i went to see a village fair with my friend
both the rich and poor students live in hostels
allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for a resource for knowledge
besides if you want my honest opinion computers should only be used as tools
or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read
this means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season
with books for there age
so why fight when the world was meant to be at peace
best friend is  and all of his cousins live in 
therefore people should turn off their computers go exercise be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family
but how many of us really observe discipline
paragraph 
it is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say  i want to read that one
could you imagine the amount of people that would be sick if everyone used the computer for the majority at their day
the same goes for music movies and magazines
if you ban books  more likely than not your favorite book would get banned
this drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive
not to mention you can even make new friends
magazines inform us on what new and interesting
that also leads into people spending time with your friends and family
my first reason of why i feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one has and not realize
then the cyclist could carry on
every night i keep a handful of grain on my window sill for birdie
authors have the right to put profane language in their books and even dirty ideas
this story about believed in yourself and never giving up it was a story about perseverance
i thoroughly agree with that statement
people have different beliefs
should it be taken off the shelf
she said that just looking at the screen and she wanted to go helped a lot
as you can see the human population has because too dependent on computers
parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else
i that i would feel a lot better if i went for a run instead of going on the computer
lastly you will have the best feeling ever you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot
is a very happy and grateful mood
this has caused tension in relationships
a good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the books just because they use the n word and some people find this offensive
fear of death and disease will not hunt us
heat dry flat  all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist
my second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because
would you be okay with kids not having the option typing their homework
dear  computers have a positive impact on people
 we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere
my first reason is that they relieve stress
magazines also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way
dear  i think we should have computers for great purposes
information on anything is always on the internet
it gives education to not only children but adults as well
i find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online
the beauty of the outdoors become forgotten
but with advancing technology site gets easier and the gives more time other things
technology such as computers are very big
the more on their computers the less exercise they get and less fresh air
of her daughter
also his lack of water was a problem to begin with
on the to do i when my brother would let me use the play again
secondly computers can make you go blind because the screen of the computer is too close

you know what else on the computer can help you with information
religious beliefs are important would you not agree
it has made our society different in many ways
whats wrong with giving someone far away a call
these are reasons
here in  it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech
computers help you do that using the internet
lastly computers allow people to chat with other people
everyone deserves to be heard
we trash a movie after only reading the title never even giving it a chance
to overcome that they needed to stick together
many books have things people disagree with but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech
it used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women
since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those things are gone
this adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family
this presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution
some people ask  books should be censored from libraries
those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder
the mood created by the author in this memoir is very appreciative and grateful
some music has bad language in it and children should not be listening to music like that
but if you think a little or maybe had experience with your writing tool then you will learn and
dear local newspaper i strongly believe computers can be bad for society
or use it to plan vacations
more websites allow you interact with people over the island
we should not result to that
first off computers can cause major obesity like it has done already
probably not this is why websites like and are getting more and more members each day
i do not believe that books music movies or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive
asks four year old 
he was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off
in the censorship has almost never been present

my favorite sport is baseball and i am pretty good
video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression
the five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call
one nurse was so rude that she never attended to any case unless called upon by the doctor himself
in conclusion this would be your choice
there are somethings kids just should not see
so get to 
the cool pines and rushing rivers this is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun
i let them tell me what they think would look better or would give more points
you can go to the or to the aquarium
be positive about online chatting or online dating services
so there is my opinion on this little matter
there is bomb making websites and illegal music downloading websites
its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves and in your believes
one person think a book is offensive but the next not
on my begging forgiveness he let me go with just a word of advice
they shows she loves her parents very much and always will
but it is and because they his parents had him and they had a house feel like a home to him
that could waste a lot of time
but there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have historypoemsdramaslovescary
lastly censorship is a popular communist trend
just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind
certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there
in the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you
computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently
lastly kids can learn about people from other times
when the scenery is pretty and cheery he is happy as well
the mood is thankful because is appreciating all that his parents have done for him
if you have you will remember where you visited
teens relieve a lot of stress on the web
would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there
another thing they might do go to a website that could help them find affordable 
animals have been here way be for us
his home was always filled with life  love
students develop the qualities of selfhelp in a hotel
if people all liked the same things would not life be boring
this aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road
but by dispensing alms as charity we do not help them
i disagree with that
this was because all information was found in books
but one should know the dangers of censorship
he barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business
now lets go into the wonder world of technology
the cyclist was faced with a desert traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water
did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation
his favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age
movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces
computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented
an ideal citizen knows his rights and responsibilities
for example  he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences
in the present circumstances the future of postmen is not bright
it all comes down to what do you allow your children to read watch and listen
he was getting more tired as he went along
boys killing themselves because 
when the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills the cyclists journey became exhaustingnever ending and difficult
i believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that
in her arms i felt warm and soon dozed off to sleep
so we people say that the computer
censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools
he gives them healthy food and keeps the stable clean
yea has a but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion
he also sells seasonal fruits like mangoes
so i hope you will listen and also agree with me i think i made my point about how much you should use computers
with a computer you can organize it all
the pigeons in the net also left the net to be flown and carried by others
she has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought
people ask  much should be censored
dear  a regular day for a person with a computer includes at least three hours using the computer per day
this emphasizes the characters total lack of resources
everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries
you can even get a college degree online if you wished
which is very painful
we also are doing our part to destroy the environment
sue to computers many people are family and friends
the geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year
also no direction is another big one
the simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them
the story says
no i do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them
click the next link and watch as a beautiful humming bird swarms across the screen of your desktop
it should die down eventually
for one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual
about of our world enjoys nature
do you know what skill was used to hit that ball
we need to do something now
do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic
so let it be the parent choice of what there child can see
i opened up the internet and typed in in and i found out that i got a on the report
the plant will grow if it can adapt
it depends on a point of view like most things
if someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library
computers can help people with their homework and essays
there is something in each that strikes a spontaneous appreciation
i think that it is should be left alone the way it is because it put that way for a reason
they help you learn and even help with hard life situations
well at least my life it is
all of these things impacted his journey with fear caution etc
there are many different selections in reading for example adventure mystery comedy or love stories
i say this because not all the time will you me to do something to do
you will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world
when someone something they watch the screen not their hand
they have the authority and right to do so
also she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is not a real one and she also says its not like the kind we had before
first the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more which makes ones body use more energy
there were no cars buildings or people
will she pass the test
as we all know everyone is different and have their own interests so they should be able to find the book music etc
send in another person with different tastes and then you have a completely empty library
as you can tell computers have affected our lives in a great way
if you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it
the magazine  has articles about how to become skinny
the local newspaper wants to know my opinion on the effects computers have on people
just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework
students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals
checking out a book from the library requires the same decision
at the start when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps he began to feel discouraged
when people grow up they tend to start reading watching and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to
in paragraph  this caused confusion and worry
we all have our own preferences how would you like it if yours got taken away
as technology advances so does our skills
computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society
the library is a place for people of all ages
is famous for it’s ability in talking
this can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop
in my opinion i think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to
i know that because i am driven to the world of computers
the mood created by the author is happy
many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer
there would be less violence and drug offenses or abuse
are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body
but his parents stood strong in those hard times
there is a large number of children’s books
next he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted unsafe water
they let him listen to his own music and watch he wanted
dear local  do you feel about computers
however with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what your looking for
these computers are bad for people
these books are classics and should not be changed or removed from the shelves
what could they do
lots of people find many pleasures to watching offensive things
he never says anything negative about his family friend or community
people should have a minimal amount of time of minutes each day and then get some exercise
computers are breaking up families and friends
next i support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people
i have cousins who live in and because of the hour time difference its not always easy to talk on the phone so we use the computer
what about the  when million were killed because they were 
as you can see those are just a few reasons
you can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country
the information then they like how
are they good or bad
books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like
letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right plain and simple
he is very polite
it all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it
i can agree with there but i truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly
i could understand the whole cellphone thing but you need to make more time for your family
this is difficult because he states the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips
you cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people
that day i did not even go to the playground
i really hope you can understand my point of view
that is where places are trying to clean things up
my mother had completely got cored
it is always enjoyable to me
computers are a nice device to have and are by far used daily by almost everyone
so he let out a sad hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself
her mind was also starting to ware
how dare you read that
people read material to entertain themselves and there is nothing wrong with entertainment
second computers take up so much time that people are with their families
reason is the give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
this shows that the temperature most of been unbearable
if he had been almost anywhere else his journey could have been much better
they will most certainly destroy you readers
certain items have different forms to them
books are censored for all sorts of reasons
i want to see them
any book could be offensive to any one person
no is to judge what we see and hear
of people use the computer to get information and get it more quickly than reading a book about that specific topic
computers are used everywhere for thousands of different things
mango trees bear fruits
could have been helped if she had used a computer
kids have been caught looking at porn buying illegal drugs hacking into systems and other criminal type things
simply teach your kid what is wrong and right
the uses radar to see if there is any boats or submarines coming near them and the have a heads up if there would be an attack
he is a hardworking man
people these days use computers for pleasure
i went on a bike ride that was many miles long in  and we did not have water because we could not take a break
just use your computer keyboard to type and send a message
obviously we must stop relying on technology to help and begin activities ourselves again
you newspaper staff use a computer to type the news
also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing
i have read a book that contains sex and drugs
i agree with those experts because many people take the computer serious and always want to be on
but in this new country his parents were struggling personally and financially but even though they started life all over again
when someone wants to know more information about any place or anything they go to the library and check out a book
computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family
the simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books
but recently the availability of the book has been questioned
at the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect
this way she found a fun place and left the country for week
being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising no sight of enjoying nature and gives less time of interacting with family and friends
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes it made him lose some courage and optimism
one get frustrated doing all work that is done by her
this is another reason why computers are bad
she means that when the flower is blooming her hope will be also and she will try again maybe this time with success
you can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the  celebrities and people that made a change in the world
many people around the world use computers to communicate
we cannot deprive children of that
computers are one of the best technology we have 
the author of the of and the of 
computer are really beneficial to busy people
example if i have a project i find the information on about people or places
these items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts
not one minded the inconvenience of wet umbrellas soaking shoes and wet clothes
from lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into a far like substance the setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist
sidewalk sales clubs sports teams holiday stroll these are events that every town offers
each materials brings enjoyment to different people
bad things and things on what you should do
there will be some interesting things you will find like different kinds of bugs and of insects
do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive
the two others will be about your friends and family
you should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else
if children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers
i do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves
should i have the right to take away books from my child
being an citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down
they take the playground
so she wont now other
no child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults
never being able to thank your parents enough for giving you that chance to live a happy life is also part of the mood
talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes
censorship at the library is not needed at all times
finally computer allow one to talk online
it tells them stories that cannot happen past events they did not live through and even the thoughts of others
new technology like computers can change the world and help things faster
censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love
in the past everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them
with it we can see cultural programmes
the computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous
i understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people
friends and family are impacted by the lack of interaction from one person
i know a kid named who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over
you spend hours on the computer or even hours
the mood was magnificent in this story
when i am studying i like to listen to music
he is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong
the narrator also said she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home lest she burst into tears again ho 
they would be able to read the whole thing with no problems
dear  i have reasons why computers effects have on people
therefore to allow books to be read music listened to and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances
when you play basketball you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination
there are so many thing that you would be missing out on
dear newspaper i am writing to persuade to put article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people
we can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly
so far in the news there have been reports of suicide of the teenager life reports like girls killing themselves because lack of 
help us to became someone important in life
but other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it
computers were made to get your tasks done quicker and easier
just a push of a button and you have immediate communication with someone
they have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics covers styles and plots
many think that computers are not bad to have but the good over shadows those aspects
have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed
kids are kidnaped and sold to be trained and used for begging
you know the average teenager spends at least hours on the computers
overall they have a good effect on the world
she did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library
electricity is very important for us
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful
i think the overall mood created by the author is comfort
there is so much more that i can tell you and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it
i hope what i have just explained now helps me make my
there is a solution out there but we just need to find it
while you like a book i find it offensive
librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level
books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age
a computer also helps me through my daily life
run around or play a bill game but not on the computer
the mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways
but some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about
this means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke
bad influences can have a bad effect on children
movies too if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it
censorship can be a very good thing
also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it
one example would be our phenomenon search engine google
to wrap it up computers effect people
because hes talking about how his family started and how met his friends
each parent has different values and standards for their child
are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured
what would those books be without those statements
people can use   and etc
what children see they imitate even in the first couple years of their lives
young boy has never been introduced to such racism
when you exercise you have tons of energy to anything
what i believe is the best thing about computers is that it is a great source to learn
i think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be
censorship is everywhere not just in libraries
this school is very different from my previous one
if others find that offensive then that is their problem
dear local newspaper i am here today to state my reason why i am against usage of computers
i have read and seen a lot of books in my life time
so you can go on the computer and find a place that is closest to you that has the book
have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years
people in  think the same
what the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it
in this context hopefully i will be able to enlighten you on the subject also with the questions of  us
i think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read
would this not get on your nerves
in the other hand if we removed a certain type of books people would get mad and not come to the library
although i see where others come from about removing these kinds of materials from shelves
i i have computers do benefit society
today the agricultural department provides the necessary instructions for paddy cultivation
dear newspaper i disagree with you about computers
yes it cause time away from family but you can easily say goodbye to the friend and talk to them later
some suggest that a certain book is obscene while others be offended by a different book
books can be very educational
the authors setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding
the character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time
he set up a different group of disciples called bhikkus
one reason was that he was in the desert
the features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey
one morning clouds gathered in the sky
in my opinion censorship of literature has crossed the line
computers are negative to people since they ruin their relationships with friends and family
libraries should not be censored
on a computer you can just google what you need to find and read the article or map etc
you can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling
i arrived at the first town
and you know how people say computers are bad
this shows how sad and depressed she was because the tone the statement was said in was a sadder more depressed tone
there would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated
if it only offends a few people then i think the answer should be no
water is the main thing he should have
in some cases books music movies magazines etc
although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time it can also help you stay organized
they love and protect their young ones
you actually have to get out and talk to people face to face
there is all different kinds of stuff in there
if not by word of print word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries as they would have come to if reading it from a book
i believe she is right
this is why i think having a computer is a good things what do you think
however the computer does not just show places
every reader seeks out a different style
same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library
one movie specifically created conflict
technology is all around us
without computer my mom would have more in other countries
should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message
 there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes
my third reason why i believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination
i think that is the purpose of the paragraph
there are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library
also for chatting
first it gives and teaches you social skills
they are showing the violence that people only have in their head
the match was played in the playgrounds of our school
the setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain
it is clear computers have a positive affect on people and society
dear local newspaper i agree with the experts when they say people are spending too much time on the computers
plus it can improve the way people feel about them books
people have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world
i was young myself and i had experienced this too at one point
those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters
i have computers but we have books for a reason no spank pop ups or no distractions while working
if you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales
taking away computers would drastically impact every day life
because more than likely there will be a better way
you can use computers to meet people from different countries
when he finally reached a place to get a drink he was finally satisfied
and then when they find out that it wont work they do it to them themselves
the right to choose what book they read is one that should not be taken
also my mom uses an online video workout website for her bad back
the bumpy road is hard to pedal over and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away
if knew that they might cause their parents to diverse they might stop playing on the computer so much
and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves but not everything
i hope you agree with me
each of these are used to plan sell present manage and write about products
please take my letter into account and publish it in your editorial
admires them and their courage
and maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here comfortable enough to try her driving test again
it would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery depressions world wars and homicides
that is a major part of life
i think that he loves his family and love is definitely a happy word
i think they are very great to have
that is some of the things that can affect the cyclist
about of people say that they are addicted
exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit
as you can tell  without computers out hand eye coordination
what there is in do
they have libraries so you can pick out books and other materials that you like
he plays cricket with his friends in the evening
also keep out of kids reach
the hot sun glaring down at you just is killing you not to book a vacation to a tropical island
must teach for others to learn
people will always have different points of view
you can search up your friends name and magic
the parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming
dear  i believe that computers are not necessary
sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them
that is why computers are good and we need them
also computers allow us to us to more info about recent events that have just around the world
it can be found nearly anywhere
before i began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do
back then i guess i only read them because i had nothing better to do which is horrible because you should read books because you want to
as i walked through and as a young girl i saw a magazine book seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine i opened it
there are some material that have offense that seems life threatening
he also writes about how he grew up which is parents teaching him about music cooking and family
the features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly
do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone
none of these books really seemed offensive
without books people would not be where they are today
like i said on the first paragraph not all the effects are positive but most them are
if someone finds one aspect of a work offensive that does not qualify for the work to be banned or discarded
give each person the choice and the rebellion will settle down
we have family reunions maybe your family can do that too
all the heat built up a desire for him to get water
i used my computer not only did i get my information quickly
my last argument is that people can talk to anyone using chat sites
also the benefits of  or personal computers are too large and helpful to pass up
libraries are made for all people and everyone has there own taste
the people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes
movies at a library are put their for educational reason like to teach kids to count and to learn something about a certain topic
you can learn about all this and more if read on
i saw some students walking around
the temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water
well i can i have and know they need and it benefits them
his sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert lifeless and dry
some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational such as 
without having to lock down at the keyboard
millions of people use a computer for working at their 
i agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking
for example new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from you computer screen
yes crime has gone up in the past years but computers have helped us catch criminals
if you disagree with the book or whatever it be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it
with the new computers people are able to talk with people all over the world
by ending the story like this it leaves the reader in suspense because they do not know if the geese will return
i think that computers help people in there everyday lives
it relaxes you pumps you up it is used for parties events and so many other things
and it is listened to not read
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story
alsoi recently learned and am getting pretty good
some people feel they have a positive effect such as learning new information and interacting or chatting with other people
computers do have many effects on people
since she is going to take the test again she wants to help her mother
and who do sent want to move your doctor happy
we have all been to a library at some point in our life
i personally know a family that is very protective over what their children read watch or listen to
this is a question you must think about when making this important decision
computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer
the road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit
they not even know what the right or wrong thing to do is
these are the sites you use to access information from others to making plans for the weekend
whether it is profane or offensive in any way there is always some kind of meaning behind it
when asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest
in my own experience from reading the book i would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to
and was unable to have a supporter to help
you tell me
imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away
i think that computers are good use many people use it for research and resources
they will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored or that they have blocked websites
i strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped
dear  computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people
no matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them and they can always relay on them
it is something that some people might do
you need a job but cant stand walk talk well you could get a job working on a computer
once most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place
so then making it harder for him to go one
the cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long tiring bike rid
instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake
it is also good for improving memory
the author has created a loving mood in his memoir
i do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now
that will happen it is almost natural for it to happen
from the library that are offensive
this reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit and traumatized its citizens
some beggars begin the name of god
these concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear
the conclusion sentence of winter hibiscus is one of realization of opportunity with spring beginning
his relationship with others in the family and society give him an identity and provide a psychological satisfaction
the cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him
i believe people would get upset if they would banned the stuff they love
what is offensive to one person not be considered offensive in another persons point of view
people who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant
it is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with
the book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request
in the end it all boils down to freedom
grownups working 
he leads a simple life
and what they want to do is of the time schoolwork
all of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist
then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up
as humans have become modernized with technology most humans lose the physical interaction that they world normally have encountered if they we not on the computer
nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets
dear local newspaper has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people
that is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase
other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see
it is an extremely tough situation to control his emotion for his family at the festival time
here is my opinion on if i think that those books should be removed or not
we need computers like we need water
this is shown in two ways the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family
i have to use the computer
my final reason kids get tired from being on the computer for so long
to conclude censorship be a disrespect to individuality personal beliefs and the overall joy of reading a good book
get up and get outside
libraries hold a lot of important books movies music and magazines
i think that this is great
that my final reason for why you should go with computers
my dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me
a third example of the mood in this memoir is the way talked about the love for his family and how important being thankful is
still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer
children of the age to should be able to read books with any profanity
this quote means like before they came to the united states they had courage and now they were going to make it and be successful
there is no way a child could check out an offensive book take it home and read it without their guardian knowing
that is why the author ended this way
i thank god for giving me a loving family and a wonderful life
therefore i do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed
how long do you stay on the computer
from this quote you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people
now if it was a book that has been misplaced i would take it from them
another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the authors family and home
we went there by bus
movies are almost just as harmless limits are needed but overall
come to find out the water tastes like battery acid
as you can see the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story
the need for a   or laptop is obviously great when you work
they are an excellent tool for all ages
identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common
most of the books magazines and movies are all reachable by little children
no one should be judged for their religion so take them off the shelves
just keep reading you never know how the story might go on
every since i was ten years old i dreamed of going to 
i got really mad when i read it so i threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them
blocked the pavement in front of me
one they can really hurt your eyes two it is not safe if you have little kids in your house
burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind
when they be spending all the time on the is because they like to be online
and not be working down at you finger keys
not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works
this is why the author concluded that way
things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them
last  i am going to talk to you more about why and how you could 
now imagine if computers faded away
since the public library is indeed public the materials it offers to people should not be offensive
you are sitting in a chair all day then you get no exercise what so ever
they help with school work like projects or email
now do you want that to happen to the world
guess what it can do better then censorship
the amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is
i mean i find it offensive but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not if you take it off the shelf
but these people are the people who are unfriendly mean and sad
in the modern world nearly all businesses rely on communication
what would happen
if a person was to not want a certain type of books in the library then i think that person should just try and ignore the books
so then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships
computers are being made with webcams or you can simply buy a detached one
go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family
the computer can teach people what they will do on their job and what to expect
everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended
she is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test
if people think some kind of music is offensive then they should not listen to it
then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer
we must always cooperate with him in maintaining law and order
i have always had a deep passion for music
we had comfortable seats near the windows
allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful
i feel energetic for the whole day
a large number of men women and children were waiting for the train
computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic
should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive 
being on the computer helps with hand eye coordination you can learn about amazing places and even talk friends
he can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions
in the end of it all a book is just a book
sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress by taking it out on a hapless alien
it is very useful for finding information fast and has many other capabilities
in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks
some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road and a shake was in his way
being a teenager myself i have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material
he can not spend much money for medical or engineering courses
there are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation
the mood of the author in the memoir are grateful and thankful
another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble
took a poll about how many use the computer to do research and answered that they did
books and magazines should be allowed in the public library even if they feel offended
for example computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from
computers allow students to research faster and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words
as the cyclist begins his journey he is confident  exited to have been offered new directions from some old wise men which promise a shortcut
all through the day he works with his students
but are they are bad for individuals to use as people say they are
they help us get information for a project at school records direction etc
instead of using a book which wastes trees to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job
i believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclists condition
none was poor and none was unfortunate
no matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves
everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they not always be pleased with the outcome
the author had literally put himself into the memoir as i read
the computer is an great place to look at updated pictures and learn about your new hometown
now me and my friend can stay in touch and can you
others enjoy it whether they share your views or 
now to sum it all up if a book or whatever it be offends you in the library then i believe it should be removed from that library
soon the moon was shining brightly
first i think books that contain violence should be removed
however the novels that i have read are not always novels i have chosen for my personal gain
secondly kids in school use computers to do homework class work research for projects or to go and study island and education
then when he found the fish camp he was overjoyed with relief
there were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist
now because of computers he is a who does nothing else but play on the computer
people will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong
someone has to find a way to fix things and in a good kind of way where people can find peace with themselves and others
books such as   is a book i had read and it was very out there and straight forward
there are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries
children are curious little beings
the people who find it offensive have the right to not look at it
there was a big snake in the road
he was very thoughtful to connect the appearances of new stars with the changing seasons
another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water
i personally find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own
he kept trying over and over again and never gave up
lastly computers give you something to do in your free time such as playing games
first of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path
just as the geese go south and as the seasons change
this is a number that in my opinion is too high
it takes more than food to be healthy
my friends say that computers are one the best because you can get help from the internet on homework assignments
we know this by looking back at the text
not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging so the setting really affected him
he means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with
first of all he rides into barren land
the rainy days that follow are a blessing
there are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper i am going to explain why they should be censured
the mood that the author created in this memoir is a happy emotional and and caring
because he is unsure of the path he is on he begins to panic a little
they organize protests sign petitions etc
when i was a little girl i remember going to the often with my mother to pick out books for school
first it shows that she is starting to like this new life
electricity is used in place of coal
happy because he loved his family his culture and his home
most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health
people in your life
plus nature and the fact of being outside inspire you to continue a diet or begin one seeing how healthy and perfect the outdoor can be
dear  i took a poll of people and of them agree computers have a positive effect on people
we are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs
also in the issue  a recent poll showed that of people who own computer use it to talk instead of on a phone
the simple answer to this highly disputed question is no
the final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world
after all everyone wishes to be treated kindly right
this benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running
no one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom
also in  the author talks about how he could not thank his parents enough for all they have done for him
in conclusion computers have a positive effect on people because its helps people learn about cultures places and jobs around them
if we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else there would be no more movies left in the world
it also has 
she was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students
a very dark future waits for us if censorship continues
if you think could get into the hands of a child or someone that would effect do not rent the item
most who are very pole also never get to outside using the internet all the time
bullying is not the answer to everything even though many think it is it is not
i am all for this
they to not be bored
plus they can talk to other people
it can be an enjoyment to read to the next person
if people spent as much time exercising then they spend on the computer then the average weight of a human will go way down
lastly humidity because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is
i have a friend who gets offended by movies that the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first
websites can contain information that working people need
if we do take off the offensive stuff off the self then there are not any more on the self
people do job reports on 
designed with distinctly different minds people want to read distinctly different books written by distinctly different authors
the whole house was reduced to ashes
the last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games
such features of his surroundings played a large part in the authors change in mood
as an author you provide a book to the public if it gets that far
and it also makes you happy it makes you think about all the fun you and your family has together
this show can be offensive to everyone but yet we still see it
i know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball
he is enjoying every family moment
that is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten
i believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph
not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately
one of the main things that computers provide is research information
the average spends hours on the computer everyday
his parents passed down their culture to him and he is happy that they did
for instance these games consisted of violence sex drugs and foul language
the hibiscus is a piece of her past adapted to fit her current situation
also computers helped us in the recent election and will continue do so for a long time
to find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue
every one has there own opinions and there own view on things
yes i think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio
is it offensive
i do not remember anything bad in it
i think chatting online is great but dangerous
the answer is simple it makes us feel connected
the main way is by typing
also in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey he saw a poisonous snake
also statistics show that nearly of students use to
also before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar like the geese
i think the censorship of some movies magazines and especially music should be highly discussed and more strict
so you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us
even though people use their computers too much the tasks they complete help our world run smoothly
people call these buildings libraries
he was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him
well not so fast my son
first of all the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water
furthermore you should have your time for on the computer and exercising
this is true and i strongly encourage people to go outside and do an activity as opposed to playing on the computer
the mood in the memoir is grateful
then there are the sappy movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a session of steamy sexual actions
be the healthy happy person and lay off that computers so that you can get the best of life
i think that once you start talking with them online finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone
not all of them think that way though
but meeting new people can also be good
take to a for instance back in that time it was common for black people to talk slang and common for men to curse when mad
we should plant more and more trees
it might not be good for the eyes of people
when he got to the party everybody began to drink
i am one of those thinkers
memories would be when we hung around with friends and family
thousands upon thousands of people were killed for their religious belief as well as homosexual people and other minorities
this is the effect of library censorship
i strongly think this because this could cause serious damage to the eyes
computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places
by saying that one could sense it is a dusty place
why is cool
magazines tend to go one way or the other
as mentioned before if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience it should be placed in an adult section
on there you can fin what ever your looking for
while the cyclist was riding it was very hot
the effects it has could be significant
her mom seems to be bothered by every action or choice of her daughters
so the way i see it everyone should be entitled on what books they can choose
i then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online
there would be no reason to their would be nobody to sing songs for us
also pictures on the computer help too
i would enjoy all my birthdays if i was that person and also my first friend
generations one after the other have enjoyed them
parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home
please let people be who they want to be
i believe this because computers provide us with communication skills
would you want to know something about
hopefully you will the paper of of our newspaper and demand a column about computer loose the valuable time for exercise nature and family  friends
you also learn social on the computer
there are tons of things you can do on a computer
we have a gas stove
email has especially played a huge roll in our society so as to help millions of people communicate when needed
no one wants the truth cut out of their reading materials
in the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with
on computers you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them
when authors publishers song writers or movie producers release these items they do not think of the surroundings
it gives the mind something positive to hold on to
the author of this memoir gave the memoir a peaceful mood
when the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again
computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family too
i think that computers are great
later that night i get home and check my  a new notification pops up and i am now friends with my 
the family got along well they cooked together ate together and so on
another thing is can get anything needed
their material provides research and appropriate entertainment for all ages
the author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test
while some books offend people censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties
this would be a wonderful thing to do they should not have stuff like that in a library in the first place
i enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you fell that your not alone
think i organize my ideas as much present them clearly
one person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it
having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression
i agree that some people waste their time but without computers everything would be much harder
others enjoy them
letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way
he had a big yard for them
i have and i think that it is a wonderful resource
as a child you have nothing but peace
i remember in grade when a girl named got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color
if anything it will take away happiness in the world
my first reason why i believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with
his hopes start to drop
many books in the library systems today contain foul language
something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued
in my opinion offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves
it is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read
in plus the computer was getting boring
people sometimes need a computer because they might be bored so they can go online and play games and have fun
censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues
if we allow this right then these libraries which allow individuality would not be able to exist
out there and yes they are certainly fun and healthy
there should also be an extra bonus at the festival time duty
is how people work and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated
because the more they just sit around
for instance my little brother plays baseball  my parents signed him up online
he begins to despair even more
they came from neighboring villages
these websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily
its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves
would you really want that for your child
its a lot easier for someone to sit on the computer browsing aimlessly on some social networking website than go out and actually meet new people
putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch
dear of society i am writing this letter to you to explain the many benefits towards computers
there were road lights near the towns
this biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summers day
the books are trusted and filled with information
the author love having people wonder about whats coming next
she stays up there all the time and when my mom calls for dinner it takes more than five to get her away from her computer
as you have now seen my handwriting is not so great so i end up typing a lot of my homework because of it
also when you look for a home decorator you just go on the computer and look up websites to see some of the work they have done
therefore the soldier is also an important person in society
but there is so man things that you can do online and on computers
those who are glued to their computer screens are no better
the library provides information for teachers students researchers writers and for readers who do it as a hobby
does using a computer mess up your life in some ways i would say no
the cyclist says about forty miles into the pedal i arrived at the first town
in conclusion i believe the computer is great need for our society
also you cant give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job
so thanks for letting me help you with your decision
but what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the self
computers allow all of these essentials to be part of society and the way this generation has decided to start our lives
in the library you can find books for leisure study training and books found offensive to a variety of people
if they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them they will avoid checking it out of the library
now then my point is that even though to many a book be horrible but to others it be the best book in the world
so now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing
they agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed 
this is why it should stop because it damage peoples minds
should censorship be used on library books
i noticed that even when my friends go away they can still stay in touch because of their computers
so now you know that libraries are very strict
everybody can add to it and you can selectively choose which additions you want
i am not in any way against reading books rather i am quite on the contrary
in reality computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it
dear  you imagine where the world would be without computers
not only that but u can also learn more about technology
people are just weird in this day in age i guess
it signaled to me that they all must be happy together
no i think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it
society is a whole lot different then when parents were kids
it always has some kind of value
there really helpful
thus the more vacations they go one which is profitable for airplane companies
i agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents find offensive
chatting online is also a terrible thing if you abuse 
reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life
make your own at home then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there
and yes weight loss surgery does have effects such as death
dear local newspaper i think that computers are giving bad effects on peoples lives
this is a 
suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library
the problem with this is being lazy
i could make that
most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie
so the computer help me on spelling it also makes your project look better
there are even music out there that only adults should be listening too
no matter if books are real or fake they create stories that interest people
a computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime
he had been very tired
that experience i had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down
by her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom
take music for example
which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it
no for live but for our life or something 
most importantly computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you
the mood created by the author in the memoir
one of those moods is a happy and good 
the teacher left the class
dear  computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike it
now even though i mentioned all those good things there are unfortunately bad ones too
if you meet someone you made friends with on vacation you can email them
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
even if the child does not check the book or magazine out who is to stop that young impressionable mind from flipping through the pages
unless it is a closely grounded secret
next is talk about being born in a simple house and that way mood there to
when people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read
if they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated 
but let someone express who they are through their likes and dislikes
either way completely getting rid of books because of their content is a terrible idea
made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize
i bet almost every kids has played a game on the internet before
with material far away people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community
using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening
he came up to places that were worn down and deserted so he knew he was alone if anything happened
for example this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus representing her new home and the old together in harmony
therefore music can be either way but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to
our culture is now bigger better faster and stronger thanks to the help of technology today
also teachers can put their grade books in their had drive
she even says but its strong enough to make it through the cold months
they have no knowledge of this part of life so what happens when they get in the real world and grow up
now you really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important
as the showers fade away once again winter sets in
it should be placed on a different section of the library
computers have been known to help develop health issues
thus we would be creating that unwanted barrier
its all a matter of opinion
do i think that certain materials that are offensive to other people be removed from the libraries
that is my first reason why computers have a positive way on people
all of those are the reasons why i think the computer has good effects
dear local newspaper i think using a computer has become bad influence on modern society
then another and another
but if people had the right to remove books or anything that is offensive towards them then there would literally be no books left in the libraries
the biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map
it is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter
just stay away from it and you will not get offended
with a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth
no one is forcing you to read the material
it causes the world to change very fast
that paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles
not only that but don you think typing is faster than writing
to me that sounds like because he knows he can always come home to his parents if he ever need help
a wonderful educational source to use in schools jobs etc
first he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans
it changes peoples whole life
well with the computer you can now see people
with more miles to gothe cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive
doing this helps everyday skills like playing sports
it helps kids if they need to research something
it started entering the low lying shops
if the book is thrown away no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away
inside the museum he showed me many things
also when you see on the internet you can get real time updates of major events in the world
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change
for example say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes
by saying this i do not think music should be taken out of libraries either
even if its just having a conversation do it maybe it can show them that you really care
for example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer parents would they would because your lack of communication with the family
in the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water
also it helps people meet or make friends
i hope that by reading this you can now see some of the many uses of computers
this movie was a total disgrace to this library it had nudity foul language and lots of violence
internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder
the author looks back on all the good times had as a kid
is is not the same as the actual thing
if you bought a new computer and you got somebody can hack your computer and get all of the information from it
now with a computer they will have no issue doing that
they could be offensive to some but to others only educational
additionally people all around the world have become addicted to the internet
citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible
in such a diverse community it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf
some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it
it was the sight of falling apple in his garden that gave him the important clue
people had different ideas about the shape of the earth
people will spend less time staying active
i believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people
definitely computers benefit society
many people could consider rated movies to be offensive but many people could enjoy watching rated movies
but movies show you how bad things are shown
then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed which was before she bought the plant
cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider
some books magazines and movies should be removed or grouped by age
there will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group
now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family
this caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty
the problem is that because of people are now more addicted to entertainment
my parents also notice that me and my brother are grumpy after playing on the computer for so long
for relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great
it is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose
so it was a very good mood the wrote the in
the setting effects the cyclist in many ways
his english pronunciation is very impressive
people who stay to close to there technology will be addicted to it and they will start to kill brain cells
the computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday
fresh air trees and birds are much better than a screen a couple clicks and the hum of a machine
but by using the computer you can find endless information about  and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to
a few years back my mom stopped taking my brother and i to the library
computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster
if they are found offensive and proved offensive they should be moved
so yea the last sentence he said i liked it
it is the way our culture is
she accepts this as a new chance to start fresh  and then try to pass the test
and always remember what the is
also you could continue a conversation you had with a friend
perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read
three if your walking down the road and gotta go you can stop right in and leave
however that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of
one such way was the setting around him
i remember when i was working on a project about 
i do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves because maybe some people find them interesting
things that offend people for instance a book about or natives and how they were treated so poorly
still many authors write about political matters and some books can educate the reader about points that they have not yet seen before
by eating the right food one is able to secure good health
you be outside you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much
overall being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people and is important to society today
everyone has found something offensive throughout their life
also a user increased light bill and wont spend time interacting
these are how the authors see their work they want to show the people what they see even if does offend someone else
why go out to dinner when you can order it online
when they need to pay a bill they could just log in pay it and move on
the way that the person is feeling is a big part on weather they try hard or they do not worry about it too much
that is why i think the author ended the story that way
many teenagers do this
i would hate for some little year old or year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life
and how important he learned that family and friends are
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society
then when they get off the computer their eyes hurt and they cant see as well
dear newspaper i personally believe that new technology is a great thing
it recently got banned from schools all over the 
well a friend of mine used to go outside everyday went outside to play
or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them
in my opinion i would say no
the mood of this duration is very warm and happy
i believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with
they had feast with music
some computers have programs that teach you how to type
he then began to feel relieved that he could get water
but it is the reading which brings perfection about the subject of concern
i mean computers help people learn how to use there eyes and hands t the same time
did you know over  people use their laptops for information and not games
so in my opinion computers do benefit society
many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive
you are going to come across good  bad thing happy  sad  you agree about and you disagree about
thank you for taking time to read my letter
when i am bored i sometimes go on and so for i have filled over thirty bowls of  while learning at the same time
and to her grief
any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway
the only books that would be left would be the and children books
dear  i think some people are overreacting its not really going to kill you
if you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it
do you think that these golden ideas are bad for our society
but there are some big downsides to this box of information
with bringing back memories of her old country
memories promise and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph
now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries
the computer is very useful when it comes to school
using the computer and internet
the last reason is to get rid of the materials
everyone should have some relationship
anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else
which of course never knew about all that
the effects are positive because your brain is challenged and your boredom has vanished
with the removal of materials such as books and music libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them
dear  the average teenager spends hours on a computer daily
it also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test
well in this letter i am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society
one of the greatest is the freedom of speech
there also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book 
many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive
wow the rate went went up like in each year
some of those books could have been the only copies yet the let their hate overcome them and destroyed the pieces of literature
for example the cyclist says not two miles into this next section of the ride i noticed the terrain changing
the mood created by the memoir is thankful and proud
once the get in learning how to type they end up typing fast
i doubt it could get any worse and so does the cyclist
when the bell goes all the children go back to their classrooms
then because of the setting
the movie and song rating system is a form of censorship i believe to be needed
people are spending less time with their health and exercising advance in technology
another reason why libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well
do they have a good effect or bad effect
another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation
this time is very pleasant
the author did not have any good water to drink because it was so hot outside which affected him in that he was dehydrated
all in all the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end
in all the students in grade ten just got done reading  of 
check the computer
this could effect your emotional heath
all these items are very animated things
i would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt
sure there are some books that children should not be allowed to see due to offensive material but why remove them completely
also if we can make something like computers imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements
also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game to keep memories
after this town he came to one ramshackle shed several thirsty pumps and men
to make sure they are who you think
i am writing to the newspaper about removing certain materials such as books music movies magazines and more
now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet
these are some internet sources that are to answer questions
when they are reading the children expand the minds and also helps them with everyday situations
first of all it is important that students see and feel nature and last time i checked they can not do that on a computer
everyone finds different things offensive
however computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities
the paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope which is an excellent note to end on
books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader
i mean you can do new exercise train for dance competition or learn new magic tricks for you magic show
people of all ages have the right to read any material that they want or other family members tell their children not to read about a certain topic
the long big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty but probably more satisfied when it was all over
kids would learn about sex and drugs in school and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any
first of all i think that when the cyclist came across the ghost town he felt alone and discouraged
libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner
eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief
movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times
but most of all there are so many cool things you can do on a computer
dear local  i think that computers are on positive effect on people
i hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries and how they would make everything better off
now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability contracting others and last but not least made me and yours life better
the computers make researching easier just imagine not having to drag home those gigantic books home or having to constantly find information in them
if they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read
in the story it says the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
the concluding paragraph in the story winter hibiscus portrays the powerful massage of change from a cold distant failure to adapt to a new life
yes the wonderful world of technology
my friends say that computers are a waste time
taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book
so on to the last thing that i am going to talk about
most people will say no we are not but you offer a nine year old to play on the computer or oh say go outside
whether or not you find a book movie music or magazine that is offensive why fret over it
the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways
the only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian
finally my last reason its not only educational its also fun
another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for
nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them
there are websites on the internet and among them there are game sites
children should be outside getting bigger muscle getting strong bones
some parents deem this inappropriate but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation
i could not believe my eyes
this should solve the problem of kids reading listening and watching these kinds of things
the internet can help you find a job twice if not three times as fast
the second reasons is that adults likes to do their jobs online
computers help people to make better car light an so on
these warnings are required
maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper
from learning to games to videos and to a tool that is very useful
dear  people owner either computers or laptops
the first thing that affects him is the heat
if it is found to be offensive to an adult audience then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library
in the hands of man
magazines like  or 
the views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person
the only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics
for example i remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me
there is a reason libraries have many sections
no literature should be censored not even the most radical magical or fictional
so let me express my love for computers to you
here another reason why from the story
almost everyone is effected by computers in some sort of way
at this point in time we could even take online college courses
in the memoir the mood created by the author i think was more of a serious informative and uplifting mood
my sister has a computer in her bedroom and i barely see her at all
i think some people just get offended too easily
it ended in the same mood started in the middle of the passage happy
say growing up your favorite books were the 
locating and researching even going to different countries even different continents is possible to do on the computer
already upset about failing her driving test the main character is upset missing her homeland
how his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him
the amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years
but computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun
another more famous book that was banned from school libraries is the in the  by  which is a coming of age story about a boy
now due to the wide variety of computer selection a computer is affordable starting at prices as low as sixty dollars
in other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test
if they do not like what they see then put it down
the reasons which i am fighting for tell why kids are in school more than half of the school day
my last reason was you can meet people
kids and adults alike are not bored
banning books is hindering authors everywhere from being able to make a name for themselves
they are everywhere
to his dismay these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area
if all of those things are offensive to some people then they need a reality check
i think computer are very helpful for everyone around the world
computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide
we all know that there are books out there are parents hope we never get a hold of
he grows different types of crops for us
just do something that involves being outside is so much fun
notice that have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended
also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive
i agree with computers do produce a positive impact on children
yeah there be a down fall to keeping offensive things in libraries
computers not be totally to blame for the problems stated above
a public library can but there are mostly adults there
therefore they are getting barely any work done
they can provide us with emotional release from the everyday world
a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you with mixed emotions
instead of instant messaging call them
things such as horror movies porn and many more
he also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home not without memories your family and something or someone that you trust
computers are too expensive to have to keep
it runs on battery and plays soft music when it moves
that meaning is life
these books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them
go out their enjoy nature spend time with you family and get healthy
 kids are to them
going on the computer takes away from this time
when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to 
one because they can interact with others
when your on your computer you can not go on an hike in the woods
she was observing herself and how different she appeared as well
your net sustaining the right amount of vitamins you need daily at a computer screen
to make it worst she failed the drivers test
the location of a cyclists ride affects the persons attitude and strength
well if you have a computer you can have an online
i think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music
the geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring
i hated seeing my friend like this but mostly i hated how i watched it happen
a library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes
it told me the address the phone number and the name of the manager
it went from happy appreciation and an explanation of his life to deep incredibly personal and to his complete thoughts
new technology and post pictures on websites where everyone can see
the features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways
according to studies done by the  people spend over hours a day on the computer
let children have a choice in what book they read or the movie they watch
now you can send instant mail which saves days time and paper
if there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads
even though these people think they are overused they still use them
about billion researchers say
someone who wants to can so do not take that away from the people that want to read 
adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries reading materials
whether teens kids or adults are gaming on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers
these machines have helped scientists to do experiments
in reading these books i see that there is no glamour in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law
one can enjoy the walk
no matter what a child or even teenager 
there are various reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people
in a recent poll out of people say that computers had made them more social
many today are obese and lazy
we must never forget who we are as a people and where we came from
so they check online and find about it there
my first reason is people can meet new people
without these instant messages and emails we would more than likely talk to them once maybe twice a year
he discovered the law of gravitation
people use computer to communicate with friends or family in far away places
they provide plenty of information communication and even entertainment
was very happy about his parents most of all
so in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects
i go to camp and have made friends i call my family
next reason is being on the computer too much can effect most peoples grades
your computer is making you stupid
computers give you an easy and fast way to communicate with others
to be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in
when the cyclist reached the bait store he probably felt much better and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke
some people like to play games
the most wonderful thing in the world i say the second most wonderful to technology
for example people such as 
so many uses for the computer
we all get affected by the advertisements in the magazines and on radio and television
even though they had to change jobs and take any possible work
everything you read in a book is because the author wanted you to read it not to just put it to fill in or to be nasty
this also gives kids lots of things to do on a rainy day
one way is to get the local libraries to participate in putting restrictions on the cards of young children
i strolled into my bedroom i noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk
so else how bad the computer is
together we can make a change or find a cure
but on one afternoon something felt wrong
that goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like
do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves
in the morning we boarded our school bus and left for the rock garden
some books might be to explicit for a child to read
new times  the wall street have moved their news mainly to the internet allowing people across the to see them
the author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year
the computer is also to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people
the same difficulty in the road
it could be the elderly all the way down to toddlers
lastly children are missing out on the beauty of nature
second reason is that what you might think is offensive might not be to another person
the book i found was a book called   by 
so what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library
she has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try to buy one
free from temptation and independent human beings
the parrot is quick in coping with what others say
it just comes to show that are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on
if there is something offensive about just ask a librarian if they can place that book or movie up higher on the shelves
for conclusion i would say people should stop being lazy on computers and have fun in the world while it lasted
i talked to my mom and she said
taking these off the shelves could make some people happy it could also upset even more
did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer when the to learn a place or a person
computers are great for 
personally i have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers
everything is a personal opinion
there are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known
you would not believe the technology they have and how they use them
are these books you want your children to be reading
of have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer
lastly is a convenient and fun way to relieve stress by interacting with other users around the world
computers have helped us come along way since caveman times
if one is offended by a literary work perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests
computers can help you keep in touch with them
the movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be or older to go back there and look
the computer sped up this process
the only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer that i played games and watched movies on
thirdly computers are very enjoyable
first reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want
this posts the question is censorship a good thing or is bad
first i think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get tutored
i am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school
the author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know
i think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going
one in five children are obese
the environment we grow up in is how we turn out   and being read about or heard is not the way to be
dear local newspaper i have been using my computer for a long time now
but taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them
you think of some of the worst books out there who would want to read those anyway
it would be keeping the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to
we all have our opinions and we can speak our minds but sometimes we do not get want we always want
first computer let learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms
even though these things are pleasurable you should limit your time on the computer
these days the computer is the latest hit
think about it would it be cool to visit a great place like 
i would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way
you can go on and watch funny videos or go on and on you friends new photo album
well now its this advance machine called a computer
this time could be used by doing more important things such as being with friends and family being outside with nature or exercising
most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information
libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it
these again are only some of the hundreds if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful
as an individual and what books i have read i believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf
there would probably be nothing left
when they need to be working on their they get distracted and start to go and their own thing
he worked to remove poverty economic inequality and untouchability
but then again a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended
well not only is a job being completed but you are also exercising i remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay
from my humble opinion some parents are very strict about censorship and i completely understand the parents point of view
our libraries would be emptied the classrooms would not have books and the stores would not have anything
after getting his hopes up he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on
the people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do
this is why a computer is a useful thing to use
they all are there for a reason
even when you are just on the computer
maybe a kid forgot his homework he can go to his school website and find it
a library a citadel of knowledge should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey
in almost everyday school rely on the internet to gain information stated education secretary 
what will come of our world
those countries whose citizens are hardworking make great progress
what do you do
the next thing would be to have all the movies magazines and music in the categories of adult kids and teenagers too
this means that the author is trying to convey is thanks and gratitude on who his parents made him
many history books contain harsh real life facts about things that went on in the past
was happy with his decision as well
we should censor things but only with an extent and not go over board with it
finally you can type your essay on the computer
if you have a computer you will have video games
and if you just want to stay home all day you can still interact with people
who knows it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around even longer if your in a city
computers require you to type which is a great skill
after an hour of searching i decided on one
this is not good because they should be out having fun not on the computer all day
people know what they want
they make his journey seem hopeless
to you it be offensive but to others its hilarious
it was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles
i know that as a student of  other students and i need to type our homework at least three times a week
in all i believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library
he must continue and pray for a town to come up so he restock on water and become hydrated once again
the parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions
also the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them
sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again
have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers
people should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like and about anything that interests them
computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people
they undergo intense training before they join the army as soldiers
you can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment
adults and children alike are lacking social needs
put down the mouse and go outside
we can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch movies listen to uncut music
i personally believe that computers do benefit society
computers help people learn things keep in touch with family and friends
adults and children are becoming smarter each day
it makes it difficult for him to bike
the library should provide a section for so that they can read appropriate material
computers play a big role in society today
they have dictionary sites history sites encyclopedia sites etc
in conclusion computers have its benefits to the social community
oliver is a good athlete too
so why do they keep releasing and publishing books if it offends certain groups
computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society
but some people say that it distracts you from exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friend
and also have you ever needed to get information fast
in the story is says the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
sometimes he carries heavy loads on his back
also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty
when he finally marched back into school barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer
the mood is grateful  thankful throughout the memoir
people just have different tastes in music
the passenger was not the one to be easily cowed down
also researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books
i do not think so
people spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
i was working on a long history paper and essay which meant countless hours on the computer typing
what is offensive to some not be offensive to others
the importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant
many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet
this paragraph links these two symbols together so the reader can relate them to the spring
lastly i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
people get distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore
many parents librarians and teachers were upset by this and argued that the topic was not at all harmful
immediately as i began to read i felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family
in a recent survey of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use
in conclusion the computer is one excellent way to interact
mainly it falls on parents on what content you want your kids looking at
even though i love my computer i know that computers can have a bad effect on people
no one can base censorship on one belief or idea because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of
and cars and planes
not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise but they also prevent people from enjoying nature and other parts of the world
what i think kids should watch or read are movies and books
so library material should be a choice
without them we would be and have nothing
computers give you extra knowledge you can connect with people and if you think they take away exercise they do not they can actually help exercise
the final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir
everyday people are being digitally sucked in
some computers are used for entertainment
these online pages causes people to go on one to connect to their friends
that is the question
to start with basic some people get too obsessed with computers
there are some beautiful paintings on the walls
why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in
without the internet
it is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family
the cyclist first had determination to get to his destination
the internet has just about every piece of information possible
when someone writes a book on something they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing
whatever the kid hears he will repeat
a library is a great place to be but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment
my father bought the tickets and we entered the gate
so in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could
am i right
it gives them a bad name
even people in perfect condition
the advance in technology has upgraded computers and now allows people to communicate through them
i also joined them
as the day went on he felt the heat bearing down on him
the weather can effect if it is rain or weather the road are messed up he could get a flat
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
yeah we might be getting lazy but it makes peoples lives simpler
banks  teachers  even cashiers
this is why it support the computer
the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist
or maybe even planning out a get together with some of your old friends
they are the ones in charge of the kids
he can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steals or rents them from our local library
he looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today
in conclusion i believe that computers are helping us and is not a bad thing
online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood
because i can use high leveled spells
another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects
i am a good basketball player and enjoy playing this game very much
you just cannot censor such a great book
not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do
you could of missed a year of stuff
the mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness safety and care
finally computer is a great way to keep busy because you take the time looking up information for school projects
being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand
by removing the source of all these troubles those acts can be prevented and society begin to the pain for reform
the author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story
libraries are full of all different sorts of books movies and magazines
i know this is my thoughts and believes people completely think what i wrote it stupid some think its smart
i would strongly advise you consider my proposal because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public
censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually
processing recording storing and retrieving information
he is strict with those who break discipline
now more than ever before people are bulling
this is why materials such as books magazines etc
when parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate
also if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them
learning benefits a grade in school or in work
the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another
during the year
the smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills which made it harder for him to ride
over all the mood is loving happy and caring
they get back their energy and feel relaxed
well get up and go outside
and where does eating that music need to go
if a virus get onto your computers your many could vanish
removing a book from a shelf just puts the craving in the hearts of certain people to read it sometimes completely rebelliously
also some of the information might not even be true
in this paragraph i am going to tell you about why i think that people should other things than going on the computer all night
if people want to censor books then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population
you can keep everyday updated at all times
what are you waiting for
but there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter
exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm
because of this they cant bond and they wont have a real friendship
so he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey
some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working
i understand that books and other material offend certain people but it might not offend others
there is things like sex songs
the books that i think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language violence and bullying
using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something
the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons
students can use a computer to do a research paper for lets say history
one has to work hard and practice for some time to become a good meson
taking away for many
through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water
there is a lot of material in libraries that should be censored from children
simply because adults do have the right to view these materials
whatever you say on the internet can be read  posted anywhere any site any time whereas in real life its really you talking
the risk of any of these things happening is very high
when the children are on the computer they do not want to leave
so next time your reading or watching something that is offending you
all the members of his family work hard
you can also learn ahead far away places with a computer
studies done by  doctor at stated that of people who are on the computer typing have better hand eye coordination than those who do not
this is why the libraries should remove all this books movies magazines and even music
the use of computers is great for everyone
first you can learn so much about nature online
mostly teenagers have this problem
friend was getting very upset at this point
in conclusion the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others
the setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist
not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials
the success of democracy largely depends on its power to produce the right type of leadership
it is the duty of the library to keep the freedoms of the people and provide them with the entertainment that they want
like when he rood through that ghost town
the younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way
also for projects in grade i had to learn about  the country in 
the computer is like a addiction
secondly computers help people learn new things
so therefore he knew he was in trouble
first right of the bat i felt love and thoughtfulness which i still felt throughout the story
people today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive
second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world
if the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in will as well
do you believe that certain books movies or magazines should be taken off the shelf in a library due to censorship
my second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family
i believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive
having an adult only section would be a way to solve this problem
finally it would not matter to me if i got ten books or movies from the library i would not care
computers also help people with their coordination which is very important
thinking that nobody cares about them
the best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone
these questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view
we should have them every day
every person he asked told him is near but from dehydration it took him longer
in some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see
or you can go on gaming sources and interact with other people
dear newspaper i heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society
movies use to be simple they would have a simple plot and everyone loved it
the mood created by the author is welcoming
censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own
also with the economy at a downfall it is the cheaper way to go
secondly the more technology there is we are going to have less
after a while she planted the flower in the vegetable garden
so that little kids can not see the front of the cases
after reading this essay i hope you realized that computers are bad for you in various ways
this part of the setting affected him emotionally
also there was nowhere that he could get water around him
the feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey
he talks about how great it was growing up in his home
i stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar like substance oozed out
you want your child to have a balance in there life manage the time where they are not all day long
you can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer
for example i read an article about the and the the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and i got 
parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games
this last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again
the butterfly belongs to the family of insects
her family had a good relationship with family and friends
all the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly
if someone does not stop the harsh comments then it never stop
to begin with in the matter of the case should we or should we not remove offensive booksmusic magazines or movies from the library
but not everyone agrees that this benefit society
materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library
if kids were reading books that the author found offensive they should get rid of them
in conclusion computers are very handy
though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive
we can do it we will fight
when i was little i went to the mall with my grandmother
parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends
can be harmless but it can also be offensive
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills 
if you are sad and need to talk to somebody you are a few clicks away from being cheered up
its up to you
you can even take classes online not impressed
the computer is used a lot for researching
what would you say to them
another example is the state he put under his tongue
must chose to go on or rather than opening their books
just like legal things only legal for adults
this will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home
but then he finds a fish camp goes in the bathroom to revive himself
what if their is a person that only reads scary books
in the story it say when he was riding that he barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down
the author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from home the blueprints of our lives
they give people the ability to learn information faraway places and people
if some books or movies are deemed very offensive by public then they should be placed in a special area
the hibiscus also symbolize her because it has faced adversity also
finally they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle
a special birthday cake was ordered for me
and get out and have a little time for going on to the computer
lastly is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends
computers give people the ability to learn about far away places
offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images videos or bad words that should not be use for everybody to hear or see
he took some taste of it
for example is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life were they fight in a war
we can drink water from rivers and freshwater lakes
some people believe can help to be more hand eye coordinated so does playing catch
like almost everything out there the internet could be used for good or for harm
if you are one of those people that love to be on the computer as much as you can
i think the last time i spent some time with my family was about weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit
first she will try again when she feels the time is right
if i look in the library i could find a book with offensive material but the book could still be a very good book
it charges a nominal amount for carrying our letters and parcels from one place to the other
but no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer
computers help teachers students employees and parents
technology is a part of life today  will continue increasing with the years
the are happy because the are all living together in a perfect place all together
removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it which is essentially the main purpose of a library
the park was converted into a fairyland
you can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about
at first in the cyclists own words things began well enough
with this system everyone suffers
so libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books
with your family
if you have to look up a new country look at far away colleges or find out about the world why not visit your handy computer
if the gets caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him
computers are so much fun and make life easier
this reminds me of last when i went to cousins house
my opinion is that i think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons
without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily
within moments of the accidents it was already circling the internet
today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves
the internet can do all of those things
the change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist
no matter what happens odds are is that children will find their way around these things it never fails
first need computer
libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book  magazine or movie
you can also got a look into space
even students can do their home work test and quizzes online
does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned
that takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things
computers also allow people to talk online with other people
have you ever set somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply
interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get  give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email
you can easily keep fit if you obey the laws of health
many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands
when computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends
i believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was blooming and reminded her of home
also it helps people do work
books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who can not yet handle that topic
these books magazines and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries
if they start crying people who are working can be disturbed
somehow i was able to get inside the bus
it is also good for couples or parents to keep in touch with their partner or children if they are away
so have fun
  you can tell a lot about his parents by those two sentences
some parents not agree with some of the material
secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state
the author describes the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture or have their own opinions
we take if you are caught doing  you can go to prison
her plant was like a representation of a new beginning
your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall
is this what you want every home to start looking like
but it is also one of the many distractions
so as you can see those are the moods i think the author created in the memoir
materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people
the men then toss them into the raging inferno and you seem them become incinerated lost forever
this quote is comforting and adds to the homey mood
also because the hibiscus will be budding that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling
i shall never forget it
i know as a young child when things were not going so well i could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things
third parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways
others have different ideas
happy because the change the simple house to a home
there is also no risk of anyone reading your mail
then at the end in seven his tone is once again loving and grateful
in the memoir he has a very happy tone because is his proud and thankful
it is understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kind of materials such as books magazines poems movies songs
i would get so mad i would put the book down and walk away
see photos of  a sight most people would never get to see without the internet
lastly in the future everything will eventually be run with computers they are the then now and later
you would be mad at them and wonder why
their families friends and jobs in the country they loved
also i would not care if i had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me
in the town everybody mostly has computers
the men gave the cyclist directions be what they remember when they were younger in age
wedding are grand affairs
instead of buying an airline ticket to see  you can go online to learn language
it is now or never friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer
inappropriate media is surrounding us daily including children
the overall mood created by the author in the memoir was courage and perseverance
all it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf
magazines are not really a problem
your friend that moved away you can send her a message and get back in touch
in conclusion the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy
the books from the movies like the side
another thing that people believe is bad in libraries is the talking
the author makes the reader smile when reading about such a place
i do think that a magazine is a book
another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material which is very understandable
this delayed him and took time to cycle around
creates a warm comforting mood in a piece of home the blueprints of our lives
everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy
one reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better
i walked into my living room
the information i want is the facts that really happened or took place
removing books means taking away history from them
for instance if my sister needed help with science she could go online and learn more information about it
there are many books movies and music in the libraries
i understand that some people not agree with me however i propose that my side is the best
it reminded her of her old home
finally i would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers
let them make money they can sell whatever they want
do you ever spend time with your family
the mood of the memoir is nostalgic and happiness
for me it the whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message
the parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not
my next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family
everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive
you can fine out many hallway can take you to or beach or other places
same goes if a friend or you move away but want to stay in touch
one of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research
all our festivals are colour oriented
the author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings of when she wants to past the test
no we should show them we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life
this shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was
all of these features affected the cyclist in some way
so should we keep using computers for the good of our society or not use computers to exercise more
likewise there are other times that close family or friends can talk to each other over the 
books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something
when he finally got to a modernized town his spirits were lifted and he was able to get water to cool him down
people go to the library for a lot of reason computers books etc
as you can see computer have a negative affect on people
all in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public
thus they make this world a better place to live in
and go on the computer
my elder sister also attended school and i was admitted to the same school
due to personal rights and what history has shown the world censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children
or if your on a business trip away from home you can check upon your family
computers have a large effect on people
by using webcams you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights
if any of the settings features affected the cyclistwhich they all did this had the biggest impact
while some think that some books have subjects too racy for readers others not feel that this is not the case
i think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it
people have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting
these reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans
with out his life is impossible
i say enjoyable because the author talks about how they main character had the first birthday and first friend
authors write the things they write for a reason
the author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community
they did so much for the author
even if you take out offensive materials there still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do
it makes them have a meaning
the features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way dehydration
movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence
in this way shell always have a little piece of her past with her
my three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family not enjoying nature and getting less exercise
there you have it computers use is not a major problem
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change
all this would help to create a good atmosphere in the school
he has to get up early in the morning and begin the day with a lot of exercises
we make new friends
i think computers have a positive effect on people
lastly computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button
strikes and balls is your count
i remember this one time i entered a contest and the i needed was lost then i remembered i put it in my computer
this goes against all our morals
imagine my joy and pride when i was able to row the boat and keep it on course
i think the books in a should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty
what would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds
i think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week
a lots of uneducated children that stay home or do drugs in the street
she ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life
many of spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday
you can check sports scores from the night before or check sports score from years ago
i believe that if we make the sections have an age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information
i can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves
why do people find it necessary to do things like that
you can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have
i think that she is comparing herself to the snow the snow the geese and the hibiscus
the answer should be simple
everywhere one goes something is being kept from them
we never feel alone in the company of books
it is not unhealthy or time consuming unless you are allowing your computer usage to be that
so now what do you believe should certain materials be removed
if someone that likes those kind of books and they are being taken off
the book did not have any benefit to  but because of that book i received an a on the research paper
she first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings
libraries should have to right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public this is why
so she go on the internet start looking at different styles and maybe she could become a famous journalist
have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true
we cannot really do anything about this
in history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to to get away from their ruler
what i mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents
they have every right to protect their child from dangers in the world but to keep them from learning the art of literature
also at one point he reaches a snake on the road
remember the old black and white films
if there were no computers i would have to use a typewriter and if i made a mistake i would have to type the whole thing again
 there are exceptions to this proposal
when it comes down to the choice you will know just what to do
a lot of the contradicts what i have been taught
dear  one day being able to talk to anyone in the world by simple pushing a button
its just the culture you grew up in and of mind you are in that current time and place
the features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist
back when we had slaves that is what they were called
this can have positive effects on people
by removing the problem we would be creating another issue
without imagination what fiction would there be for children to read
also the same with magazines and music
the author also loves his family
when he was talking about his home readers could almost feel the love the food and listen to the music
computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way
in case we get lost on the roads the computer can us get to out location
finally it provides an accurate research tool for school projects or interviews
the cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration
in many libraries there are books movies magazines and much much more
not only does it lower the risk of the letter not getting there but it is also much quicker
if you feel like a book a song a movie is offensive then stop reading listening or watching
i think censorship should somewhat be in libraries but not to the extreme
lot of people have different of computers are more improve more faster and more high quality
for example kids are always
its proven that students who use computers from schoolwork they make learning easier as well
the kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades
they gave up a lot and he recognize that
the opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across 
for my first reason computers have so many technology things inside that help people everyday
going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians they should be supervised at all times while in a library
would you ever think that a computer can take to much time or keep you from doing lots of things
typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy unsophisticated work
did you know that in a recent poll in the  of use computers everyday
they laugh play and cry like we do
she has perfect skin
the computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that be brought up in a class room
it could be twice a year or more a month or whatever is picked as long as there is one day or even more than can exercise on
the lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there
i urge people to dump and 
having an account like this is said to be addicting
that includes the variety of things humans are interested in
students have the right to choose what books they read as well as the ability to know what they should read
to the past computers have caused problems with the human body
they should censor what their children do
in my opinion we do not need computers
soon i was one of them
also the internet can help bring couple together and potentially lead to marriages
the story i just read was inspiring
of them are free too
we citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in libraries the should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want
it would teach us to be more intelligent
when we read we find books that are to our own enjoyment we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads
the mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there and go there
i have a best friend who lost is father to these sexual acts and pictures
these great qualities computers have for people are fantastic
dear  the effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society
best of all when you forget to write your home work down you can go online and ask one of your friend what it was
book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed
in this case i think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves
next is that it could cause rate success drop down low
on the other hand some people say that computers are bad
and last children should be playing outside
certain books movies magazines etc
thank you for taking your time and effort to read this i hope it has persuaded many people
if i were the principal of my school i would ensure that the laboratories were well equipped
love for family and love for each other
i feel this way but i am not a person that is tuck in their ways where you cant change their mind
it is a great pleasure for me to see my flower garden every morning
he went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water that tasted like battery acid
the things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings
when i was in middle school i was a shy fragile young girl
plus while so much you will be prone to using in  thus you with nothing but a bad grade
well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others
after narrowing it down she had made her decision she had picked  a she had never even heard a couple months ago
the mood is also family because when someone needed a place to stay from their family they would let them stay at their house
relating to his thirst before he left he grabbed some pebbles
so they can live in a house
there for computers cause health issues
and it also makes you thinking of all the your family has to make for you
censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today
because we are all the same
to sensor a book from a teenager or child is just like more of an invitation to see whats inside of it
she is saying when the hibiscus returns she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it
computers help people around the world to connect with other people computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world
this emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing
computers are important because your child will get the proper education that they need
its feet are padded
it gives capability to do more than you can imagine
computers are great but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of activities
i think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want
the makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable
truth is there will always be people who disagree on subject but that is just the way things are
the answer is the customers at the library
finally his parents were able to support these bonds
this way life with computers will be beneficial after all
this shows how the author grew up helping people
the plant also comforts her
this show how hot the desert was and how he could drop dead
instead there should be a rating system on the books and magazines
the author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir
in people over the age of nine have an email
the results were more than shocking with all of this in mind ask your self how useful the computer really is
now you can webcam people
one can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book
it is fun because you are not bored
as a student at  i have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments
the mood in the story is thankful
he is called the father of the nation
this man was not a good swimmer but he had decided to swim
in take home and watch
in the wedding hall i sat next to my mother
in doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people
some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery
movies guidelines are along the same pattern
then i went on a tutoring websites and they taught me everything that i was having trouble with
many people have to read almost every day people not realize it but they do
this lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist
it should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children section has toys and puzzles in them and children theme walls
some people think computers are an improvements to society
a visit to a zoo is an interesting experience
just like that their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy
instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves
another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures
next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get 
it needs to be fixed
all libraries have different sections based upon age
fortunately a tragedy was averted
i looked out through the window
the mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy mood
music should not be taken away from people going into a because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter
they would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves
if books would have to be remove from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out
the operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits
some of the most interesting books that i have ever picked up have been controversial
many children get their acts from books movies and magazines but most get their acts from something different
now think about it you jest going to fly there and come back the same day
a lot of parents complain that their children are doing bad things in the streets
plus computers begin to consume the rest of peoples lives
also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information finding out where you live
it involves sacrifice of time and thoughts
it is how they express themselves
when was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport
so you can and you will get a good grade
another bad thing about  or is that dangerous criminals can hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place where they can be kidnapped
the hills would make the trip more difficult
introduction – planning gardening – house improvement – reading – conclusion
eventually libraries will have nothing left
computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society
then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf
keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn
welcoming family in their home showed love
that quote also shows togetherness within the family
baseball is why i can bench press pounds
what better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences
i know that the population of uses the computer
i would be very upset if my child had to see that
some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion
whether it is books movies or music a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item
now that older and like to read i read more books about action and mystery
the different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence
after lunch i take a nap and then finish my homework
the worst thing of all you were not able to spend time with the family member that you love the most
the dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun and loss of water through sweat
secondly purchases can be made
finally it helps your school work
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
if you removed everything that offended anyone it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves
let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world
there are some rare situations when restrictions need to be upheld but merely based on age
another issue is banned books
exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life
in the book   books are outlawed
that is why i think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality
removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library
when he wrote his tales he made the high class people sort of mean while he made the lower caste people on the humbler side
should you take control and get rid of it
if the ruler has the power of censorship he or she can control what the public thinks feels and believes
is is that easy
the issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children
people will soon stop believing that non sense and eventually stop purchasing these newspapers
his duty is very hard therefore he should be paid a respectable salary
if you want to start dating again you can always start online
the time has come to take a stance
it can fix relationships save lives help you get over fears and see the world
books should be censored if they are made for children
all the members of his family are good
water is used by us in our everyday life
last but not least you have to watch out for your health
family to take time from away from us
these books can cause children to use it in action to show it off to other peers and to hurt them as well
this is my say on this topic
dear newspaper i am writing to you because think computers really effect people in a bad way
now to parents with children
it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope
better yet you can download the movies media are available  with you able to watch them with the click of the mouse
this shows the effect the exposure to heat had on cyclist
dear local newspaper i am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways
with the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants they work together and kindness prevailed
censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries
i have deaf parents so we always have the captions on in our house
if we are lucky to have a noble friend he will save us from all our depressions
we all like different things
children have actives mind that pick up on everything around them
for example computers are good for motor skills and what about school work computers help a lot when you forget your homework log at school and lastly sociability
let these books serve their purpose
if you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature
humans use computers mainly because it makes life simpler easier
the features of the setting affected the cyclist
a parent not want their child to read hear or see something simply because it offends them
as the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what 
his parents are loving people and so is 
like i said in my first paragraph everywhere you go you see somebody wired into an electronic device
the features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically
censorship seems like a great idea at first thought
the topic of and the be found to be offensive because of what they stand for
the hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills
some materials found in libraries that be offensive to one person not be offensive to others
the computer can teach you about any career or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes if needed
everyday the teachers would give an update over his computer
for example a teenager would be on the computer who is making fun of them
movies are rated based on their content
exercise hike swim and bike
he was taken to a private hospital and was admitted as an emergency case
parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in imperfect world of ours
even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed
elephants live in herds
i believe that materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children if they are found offensive
for example the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing
you can also do your homework neatly on the computer if you have a messy handwriting
would we take the classics away
one person thinks is bad another not
get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends
censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be
they probably rather hear wire then
just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement
when talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun
prevents you from exercising seeing friends and family and cam impact lives in a bad way
everyone is an individual and is different in their own way
material that is found offensive does not belong their unless it is for real educational learning
some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate
we as people need knowledge
books should be something that each person should have a choice in
the cyclist also had a really bad time because he had to taste stones in order to make his thirst go away one example of that is when
some magazines books and movies that are age appropriate
each team has five players
the author creates many woods in this memoir
 well that could also be a reason people want materials removed
no because people likes different books movies music and magazines
after many reports about the book the book was taken out of the library
most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them
the media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad
it is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not
a second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him
you can instantly talk to people and catch up with them
lets say they set a hour limit then once its up they have to get off
i know thought they were buying a pair of boots
so grateful appears to be a keyword
libraries are great for multiple reasons
out people who store their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do 
the text states that it was yet another old friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers
there are many reasons why i believe that computers benefit our society
every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to
do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea
they do not know what is happening outside 
the worst is probably watching bad things
everything from check out isles at the grocery store to coffee makers at home are being upgraded all the time
every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed
the effect on him was the main conflict of the essay
if you get off of the computer and talk to one face to face you can improve your social skills
you can also customize your computer to your liking
the computer has a lot of games you ran play on so it would keep you doing something
there are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir
no one every told him
but any ways those are reasons why
each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics
it was hard to adapt to the situation of moving but the plant created familiar scents and the familiar fragrance which filled her lungs 
some books magazines and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone
computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles
books materials like these make a difference in someone life other than you
maybe that person has personal issues
meaning its really hot
say their a teen and end up finding you that is why parents should not be let their children be on period of time and should be on
i myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too
are offensive materials offensive to everybody
another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are 
that is just insane that you would want to wast that money after being payed for
the second thing on the computer is research
a big thing that conflict with censorship is the idea of religion
it has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions
in the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist
like people on the other side of the state or country
lastly there was a mood of family
like in the beginning computers help us learn keep in contact with people and are our future
our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world 
computers have none of that
without this gadget we could not be able to live the life we have  a life that can get us to where need to be
the computer is defeating that purpose
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
they are things we must learn about so we do not repeat them
through the around change need keep one thing the same no matter how difficult it is 
after all it is for their own benefit entertainment and learning
music is another thing
that book on that shelf that you accidentally ran into while doing a research project
rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her
in fact a study done by the board of ed
their job is to supply the community with books movies magazines etc
i am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library
kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results
the ones that teach us about life and society
if they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song then why not let them
he showed a real admiration for his childhood and the people he shared it with
the last movie that i did not like was all the movies
he thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy
it is better to use love and nonviolence
play a game
dear  of is all about computers
computers cost a lot of money
what did you think about that
also statistics show that of own computers
the class teacher was a kind lady
if something causes someone else harm we should not do it
computers are harmful to our society
then i hate falsehood
these are the three effects computers has on people allows you look up information gives you something to do
computer also allow you to check the news and weather
thus they disturb the class
the have a right to learn without the influence of others but censorship denies them of that right
in college you will take notes and do assignments
the cyclist is affected by couple different things
clearly it is better to spend less time on the computer and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends
there are many things you can do on the internet
secondly computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people  places that are new to them
the trees looked green
for example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run
tell them or let them read the books you always censor at the libraries so that they know
one reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways
all of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then
the cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place
when he first begins his trip the road is fine so he becomes confident
they want to because they are inappropriate but the thing is they are not inappropriate to everyone
the whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like i honestly was the experiencing his home  the love  kindness of his home
i walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer
in additional people think it keeps them busy
he has trouble finding a place to get water
dear  people are spending far to much time on computers
there are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer
health your social life and also your education
his parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person
there be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives
do you think that books music magazines movies should be removed form a libraries shelf
it is grateful in a few ways
everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship
this last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful
so as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things
censoring any type of media such as books magazines movies or music from a library is not right
the theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change
first of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you cant do anything
later that day my and i were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway
if you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet
would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries
the sun has a great influence on all living and
this helps a great deal
it was great to have the hot soup as it made me feel warm
but it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf
welcome to the 
it seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country
two the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path as well as the occasional tumble weed
instantly you will have hundreds of choices right in front of you
lets find out what i have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people
some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music
without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time
if people started taking certain things out of there book stores libraries it would eventually get out of hand
family is the most important part of your life and if computers are getting in the way computer use absolutely has to be changed
once again computers have played a part in this too
advertisement many be makebelieve but it has to stay
these free websites let you add friends send messages and post pictures
imagine your child or someone that is very close to you
couple that with him biking and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert
in conclusion computers are used every day and help us greatly weather it be learning a new language or just talking to friends
somethings can get in sink too a brain and it could never be helped or solved
in this essay i will discuss three cons of censorship in libraries
he also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the united states
censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food
first by subject down to the author
therefore computers would lead to students getting better grades
nowadays children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading you can imagine
in today many young get raped
and even better you can buy a tax program for you computer so you never have to leave your couch
its not like they are watching anything bad
most kids spend so much time on the computer and they to do their homework
it is the parents job to regulate the readings of their children but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf
it still exists
but of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time keeping computers would benefit in so many ways
nudity cursing and drugs are all offensive images i have seen in a library
later on he realizes his water was going down  he is getting tired his mood changed to exhaustion  defect
so people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely
so help the world help you and go promote the use of computers across your community
limit your time to a half hour a day
without computers we would have to do it old fashion style
parents have to set a good example for kids
also i think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard
the cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse
i believe censorship is necessary
in my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things
normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them
that is to help you spell the words out correctly
so seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone i got most of the other volunteers to help me
most people will think that most books magazines and music are bad for the kids and for the adults
many of them have to do with different religions or races that people have different opinions on
it provides numerous shows and articles with a huge array of topics
kids are fold to type their papers which lets them finish faster
so next time you go to the library to research a book stay at home do the same online
i know i do
these are the only ideas that i have that would work well
no i do not
we need computers they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe
also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore
i say that there should be no library censoring
with the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of where they type every day and work hard
if i had it my way the would not exist
on average it takes seconds to find information
take my advice and buy a 
dear i think the effects that computers do on people are really positive
you can be able to type well and very fast after a while and improve your eye sight by reading your writing or notes for a paper
reflecting my view on censorship in libraries
out of gas and you need to go to the library before it closes
when people are deciding when to get vacation they go in the internet
another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting
there are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day
i think this censorship issue is a prime example of that
of all cherished every moment lived
please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial people do not spend as much time on computers
the setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills
my third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people
have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living
dear newspaper have you ever stopped to think what modern day technology brought us
the library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and fortunate
i wish i could sit inside it and fly high up in the sky
mother earth has given us many gifts
its appeal both to the eyes and the ears is great
dear newspaper editor i am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of 
our beliefs life styles way of thinking culture and the list goes on
the cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting
when you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive just put it back on the shelf and move on
banning books would go against what our country stands for
they are the then now and later of the technical world
last i want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material
now we could be talking about at the very least
it brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent
there are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above
the size of the house does not matter it matters who you are there with
an example of his determination is the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road
so she tries to hang on to her old memories only to that in  everything is different
we can send registered letters birthday greeting parcels and money orders through the post office
social networking sites like and are all over the internet
later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents
coming to it in many shapes and forms
stop reading this article and go out and meet new friends
you never know what new technology could bring
and how his parents seemed like great people
computers do not do that for us at all
also it does not matter at all if i had to pay a late fee for the books that i checked out from the library
people might change their mind about going to that particular library if they find a lot of offensive things there
so i plucked up courage and started learning again
every book would have someone say it was offensive
just as the winter that killed the plants ending life the spring will come and start anew
our state does put in each year for our parks just so we can ignore them
people should wont to get out and interact
writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it not be pleasing to me or any other person
the same applies for magazines and movies
they will they fall into a depression
so when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot
knows that members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family
everywhere in the no matter where you are there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you
you are probably saying that you have time to manage both but some people would rather exercise
media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned
debates are a main part of our society today
i subscribe to magazines and read books on these subjects
if we say stuff right out of the offensive book we would get in severe trouble
it is his duty to protect the life and property of the people
then libraries cease to exist
if we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library
most important of all the life changing story about and how it changes peoples life today
or another question is  did they let my child check that out
as soon as a train arrives they rush towards it
sometimes politics have a say in this
therefore the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air
music is a persuasive thing and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing  could be bad
these day if not then of house designers use computers
although it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice
especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope
he explained a little about his parents when the first came here to 
everyone gets offended
computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising
i feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable
someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way
computers have positive effects on people
should people have the right to remove books music movies or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person
well i believe that having computers around are good because
another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality
many experts agree that computers are the learning cause of obesity
libraries should not have to remove books music movies magazines etc
this shows that the house was full of happiness and warmth
not only does it entertain but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books
happy and grateful stand out as the two most important moods
the mood in the passage is 
i go on all the time all the time
they poll the customers and see what they think they do nothing at all or they remove the item to keep the person happy
this is one of my reasons why computers effect people in a bad way
that is why will need technology
well then computers is your online fun source
before my school closes for christmas vacations i give gifts and cards to my friends and teachers
also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills
on the other hand is a conservative
the glowing realization that i could die from a heat stroke this quote proves the time and energy of the rider is running out
however i think people used computers the most for communication
it is your choice to avoid the books that upset you not what other people think about them
second of all the mood of the author is appreciation
here are some reasons why i think that computers have good effects on people
censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day
being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online
moderate censorship is acceptable for the young but there is a line even though it is hard to find sometimes
the mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love
they live a very difficult life
our doubts are our traitors’ said shakespeare
something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book
with only a chance of living gave her the support she needed through most difficult 
this is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for their parents do for them
what if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing
home is where the heart is many of said this and many more have meant it
nature is full with colours
if there was a book that they read about a person being bullied maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher
the library also should at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library
being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature
their easy access and very helpful
popular websites like make this extremely easy
their is one more thing that i think is very important which is magazines
it could be their passion to write so why would you want to take that away
well this is what i had to do
everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material and censorship makes that impossible
planting the flower is a representation of adaptation since they have moved to a new land
this final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea
it brings a very warm feeling about you
some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves
do you mean how
people spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends
a computer has made the life of a school student so much easier
one reason to why i think that people should spend less time on the computer and more times outdoors is so that they can get more exercise
everything we saw had a story to tell
what if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport
here are some points to consider
computers contribute to people who want to learn
with music walk cool friends right in front of us who has live
however the most prominent seasons are summer winter and rainy seasons
imagine how angry the parents of the child would be
of students get out of school and go straight to the computer
what do you think about computers
preparations were made many days in advance
to start off computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members
the factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist
people might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something
some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves
i think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child
there are also many websites that have games on them
everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of
so its now or never
well in the way i see it they are wrong because keeping them is better
we dance to it  sing to it  workout to it  and most of all we just enjoy it
you would get your way
i know this because it said the water bottles contained water a few tantalizing sips which means it was few left
helps you when you need info on a person place or thing
these are reason why the society should take back the computer
these dangers effect every user and their families
within the library there are sections specifically just for children
i believe that no one should decide for us
by violating the openly this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the 
advances in technology
the features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly
the winter made her sad longing even more for home
the author shows it by saying love of cooking
libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre but a young child not be aware
almost everything on the computer has to be read so gives a lot of practices
computers are only here to make our lives
that is the mood that showed in his memoir of his family
proven by the best major over of children either have desktops laptops or some type of internet access
they start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are
this hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read
that sweat was all over him
when i go onto the computer for only minutes my eyes start to water
the cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert
travelling in a desert is very difficult and dangerous
i have use some examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what i think is right or wrong in this situation
it also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening
one is that people are not spending any time in nature
we walked out the front doors and we were on our way home
benches and chairs began to float in the water
instead of drawing it the internet can save time and effort
they will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean
if you want to know more send on
it takes away from people and when they do that it makes citizens feel like toddlers
this part makes you feel warm and happy about family
artists write about what they love and how they feel
the author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills
if someone was at a library and thought the   series were offensive they might be the only ones to think that
on the contrary they are all over the country and are used by people of all ages
some of these relatives live very far away or not have a phone to talk on so you can talk to them here
not only can they be time consuming computers can also be dangerous
but why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family
people are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material
some of my friends to have started enjoying a reading book as much as i do
which could be very bad if you think about it
i could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it
he teach others how to live harmless lives
it has came to my realization to find that many people would live long lives if they could not internet will friend
then the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body especially because he had no water left
they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes
if you know what i mean
badminton originated thousands of years ago in india before many of the other sports were commercialized
so why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing drugs and drinking
if we really have that freedom the censorship violates it completely
there are few moods created
things that children would like to read listen or watch about
all of us were very excited and came dressed in lovely clothes
not their choice though
if wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well
and can only create a better person
adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need
the invention of the radio changed the world
indeed many people in this world are influenced with bad things
now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners
at least or more kids are obese from recent studies
so people should just spend a part of their day on the computer
it is filled with facts beliefs theories and opinions of people
so i think they should change it around
is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech
people speak about computer literacy computer courses
that young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see
he also talked about his loving neighborhood and not blood related families
have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive
dear editor name is and i am a year old girl yet active in reading the daily newspaper
instead seeing the through their own eyes they are seeing it on videos or in on the internet
i think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves
if there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive should it be removed
cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society
last of all censorship can also be a good thing in some circumstances
i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air
you ask what it is i am speaking about
but with that in mind is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device
should materials such as books music movies or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive
do not even think about
many libraries contain books movies music and magazines that can be considered offensive
he goes to his office at eight thirty in the morning and returns home at seven in the evening
there should be no reason that one person or persons should try taking something off of a shelf at a library just because they find it offensive
the setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map
if you are stuck on a computer for hours a day you will never have any family memories
in hos winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph
another girl with her computer talks to her friends
i mean yea i read articles from magazines but like i said mostly listen to music
now this kind of book offend a few people but it save a family a friendship or maybe even a life
secondly all the music that are good and bad will be taken off the self
the author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful
because they can get over weight
also many people learn how to manage their time on the computer
here are some situations many people run into if one person finds a offensive but no one else does should be removed
friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them
the first reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because they help students as well as many other people study
if a teacher gives this book to a grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it
you also learn more thing about place any thing
in this memoir the mood created by the author is gratefulness happiness and unity
i was thinking to visit a suburb of singapore
its not all 
also they have to pay and odd dollars on the bill to keep the connection
furthermore people all around the world communicate thought the computer
someone in this world is living this life it could be you
companies use computers for easy access to the public
people can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school
all teachers should have their own website that you can get from there
also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are
well when you talk to them on the you can do other things
computers are best all around helpful
my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends
you can live without using a computer for us a week
i feel like some educational magazines be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand seeing it will help them understand
offensive or not
scary movies are not real and some books too
the author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech
the authors battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills
the sight was troubling
this is not because we want it there but because these things are a part of life
dear  the computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen
i do not think that there should be censorship in libraries
its a new time and age and things are different
can it get better
saves money and time
all beings and plants need water for living
they said that the earth goes around the sun
you can look for that trip of a lifetime in a book
they are time consuming but they count for a huge chunk of our grade
the library is a fun place to go and it would be even better if everything there was good and not bad
parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of 
the mood that was created by the author was respect
i know that if one of you experts family member went away for a long time you would miss them and want to talk
that are found offensive to people
had they been on a different mountain there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine
you could never lose touch
do you use the internet to help you
so say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display
a doctor knows how to treat and cure sick people
like wise to the physical treatment computers an relief
or be around
sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books
this is not the case
they should be able to write sing or film what ever they want
if you ask me there are a lot more offensive things on the then there are in books
but then he got his computer
there is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know or not to do if in that situation
books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library
your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with
i remember when i was in grade i made a new friend and she moves to in the after grade
this means that the test was very important to her with the of pressure to pass and of a new is ready to pass the test
the first five planets are named after roman gods
the car was badly smashed
this topic is just too abstract to be regulated
par  this gives the memoir a friendly mood it shows that the author loved his whole neighborhood
you have a friend or family member you lost contact with
be a sport person and one likes to get free online are websites like and so you can
computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday
the flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test
in libraries they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to before they rent it out
people who like to read books should have a wide variety of books
a good thing to you could be a bad thing to another and what if that disappeared
i think they should consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things
their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media
the spring is a season where everything is fresh and new
although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent brutal and cruel no book or any other material should be censored
websites can be a way to find computer time
let me explain more
that is why i am no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves
the person has that ability to read that book or not
plus computers waste our time
the necessity for censorship should never be an option
i think computers have a good effect on people
the author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home
so come on down to the council on and vote for the new of the 
people view offensive writing and actions differently from one another
the cyclist in the story was hot exhausted and hydrated
not all censorship has to do with sex
it saved his life
just recently there been earthquakes in and you can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need
that is my opinion about censoring things from libraries
he looks after us and also takes care of the school garden
this system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive
it is part of what is great about this country
the internet offers so much information for people of all ages who want to learn and thrive
things began well enough
how i would argue with this is by listing my own experiences observations and readings
if you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you
we play different games in the playgroundthe laboratories are wellequipped
it is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education
however one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school
this is the case in anything for example movies books and daily life
in the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers
while he cannot go and rent the movie if his deem it acceptable for him to see then they can rent it for him
everyone has interests in different types
about what society would be like
i then go and brush my teeth
his parents were kind suddhodana and queen mahamaya
there are so many authors whom i like
at the end when the setting is bright so is his mood
the help each other whenever one is in need
to begin with why are books music movies and magazines produced for
you wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer
you can see you favorite shows and moves
if does work men went them to do
in closing i would like to add that i can also see why people would want to censor certain things
in the excerpt it states
my reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want
i always thought that was part of our constitutional right
i believe that having a computer can be a very cool thing to have and very useful when you need it
it is all a learning experience
clearly using the computers takes time away from family
also people can talk to each other and believe  create whatever they want
let me ask you this question again
people use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings
saying this is saying that is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him
therefore computers are very positive since of use them now positively why stop
i feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings also its offensive the way that some famous people act
exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit
you should buy a computer today
this is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him
now i will write one paragraph about each
then it started to get hot and he was out of water
no not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive
finally people can apply for jobs or even community service online
it is not possible to test in three hours what a student has learned during the whole year
so try to get exercise hang out with your friends  family and enjoy nature
such as books magazines and catalogs but are all of these appropriate for the crowd that dwindle around a library
so many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions
cause what if someone else likes the book they have the right to read that book 
had made us a better world
the cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert
some libraries do not carry books because he uses curse words
sometimes i wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way
what if we took you computer away
interacting with friends and family is always a 
this is another law that says citizens are allowed to think they will of anything
take a walk
if we limit these items we see positive results
now for the books
so basically like i said you do anything
the first mood that is shown is a loving mood
they do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part
like making holiday and birthday cards
it has very tall legs and a long neck
i completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today
those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves
also he saw a snake that scared him to death but he passed the snake
the first and most blatant reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter
the question is is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves
libraries always have some type of organization
let readers have their freedom
besides education computers touch upon our economy as well
people are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else
next even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music
if your child wants to grow up and be a fireman you do not tell them that it is offensive to people so they cant
you need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature
my father filled up a from
the irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly
i think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life
my second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school you can go to college
he went the way the old men told him to take
there will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine
can not think of anything
though it still goes on i think that it is very closed minded
the story says i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink
that is just unfair and unjust to some people
whatever the cause be they have the right to expose their children to anything they see appropriate
there is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer
it is opening because it says we let anyone we consider family stay over for however long period of time
dear  i am writing to you to inform you that i agree with the followings said on the writing prompt
in conclusion i think that computers are a waste of time
for example research and entertainment
first computers help out with traveling sight seeing and lots more
where will it end
‘clean management’ makes the benefits go to all in the from of comforts
this made the biker have to work harder and use more energy
we all sang songs of joy
as you computers have a lot of positive effect on people
some people have family in other countries that they have not seen in a long time and with a computer you can talk to them
also you can talk with your friends if your phones not working
the computer have sites where you can talk to friends but that is no where as good as seeing them in person
take for instance the movie  
one day i shall fulfill my dream and become a pilot
i think that nobody should have the right to remove a book movie music or magazine from the shelf
being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science
i think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons
there will be less interacting time a risk by going on a computer
the effects computers have on people are beneficial
some parents can prevent it from happening
well i can children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days
they showed me with their lives and these teachings have been the basis of my life
you can reconnect with distant relatives and old friends
i mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries
the towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns and are no help to the author
and you can watch live sports games from your computer
there are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world
with out inappropriate media on our library shelves our world would be a better place
citizens spend over a year on phone bills
i wanted to go near them
and computers can make our live s a little easier
sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing why would we put them on a self to be publicly displayed
some of you who are reading this would say yes but why
there are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and
know one can live with out computers
people should spend less time on the computer
everyone has a preference in works of literature such as books magazines movies or music
as i got ready while my position paper this year
they changed his hope to doubt
or how much would it cost
look if you want to roast computers then by all means roast away
we need computers to do things and do tasks needed to live life
people can also also contact other people
when you can talk to them in seconds
computers are needed to help people learn in our society
here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home
games teach you to act with a team spirit
but most the people that i know that are different colored are pretty hilarious and sometimes make jokes about it
are they always looking for games to play
it can contribute to obesity turn you into a couch potato and can take away from your social life
i believe that the media such as music magazines and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society
it beats faster when we run or walk fast
another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money
why don they see that
book burning is a horrible action by any person
to  computers can be both and positive but i chose to look at things through a positive eye and i think you should too
would have died
there are now several ways to talk to friends phones texting instant messaging and even video chat
there is a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as there online
his parents also sound loving to him because they were brave and sacrificed a lot for him
the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons
removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go
another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world
there maybe somethings out there in this world that you think are offensive but have you stood up and told that company yourself
just about everyone would get offended by one of these books because nobody liked or does like  but they have to be there because of history
secondly movies on computers can be a real time if you want to around
i have been offended of some different magazine pictures before
she feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable
everybody in the community acted like they were like they were blood related but in reality nobody was
another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house
football volleyball cricket running and swimming are a few such games and sports
one main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time
there are many ways you can do this on   twitter yahoo
this is the mood created by the author in this memoir
computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as or they are also a way of communication
to sum it up computers allow you to talk online to people
could book a hotel online
you can also see majority of people like what they got
dear  i computers is a new technology that keeps on getting better and better
many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals
in i mite not be into what they are into
this is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show she has hope
all and all the author created a mood in the memoir
the authors choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to
this would mainly be because you would only have one point of view the point of view that is perfect for everybody
you can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone
i strongly urge you to change your opinion from negative to positive about the effects of computers
the cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert
if people were to go and start doing things besides the computer they will live a happier healthier and better life
although sometimes the child stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice
so he drank more water than usual
if there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school
or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families
dear newspaper i have been reading about the debate about computers
now that hes drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it
books are part of history no book should be censored
computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees
i personally love reading and like all kinds of books
the hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society
you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too
in the story it says the sun was beginning to beat down
music booksor magazines are okay to be in the library yet alone in the people it self
another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the regime
so you go online and learn everything and anything about 
the mood was very serious and grateful
many people a days work at home they have their own office
what i think about all of this
i will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version
such as in war books the characters curse a lot
the cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water
the computer has many ways that you can write that paper  now it will be very helpful
everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books
you get most of your vitamins
everyone has things that would offend them whether they admit it or not
overall my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished
how can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs
i would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching
then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced
second they help people communicate with people from other areas
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
and with computers this is possible
should be removed from the shelves if found offensive
computers with risk
most libraries have children sections
in conclusion you need to get a computer
censoring these people can and would be horrible
and finally computers are very expensive electronics they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed
they had hope in their children when they came to to have great and prosperous lives
the computer in this instance has made  positive impact an society
the author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir
if they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise they would be fit and happy 
clearly computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society
when i did get on the computer i only had an hour to look up everything
it also lets people interact with others in a different way
prayer should spring from the heart
if a parent is concerned about what their child might read they should confront their local librarian
it is to the community doing what everyone else is doing and not being different this scares people
furthermore people spend less time interacting with family and friends
 is a lot of positive things about technology especially computers
i believe that we should be allowed to choose which books shows or movies we read or watch
throughout time fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive
i know that everyone is not the same and feel the same about everything
lastly if you are on long enough enough it will become an obsession
those are three moods that were created by the author in the memoir
over time computers have caused most people to be lazy
how can writing be offensive
in the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win
being a parent you should already be prepared for things like this
the cyclist encounters rolling hills tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns
the adult movies are worse in every way
he for gets about everybody
the author creates a loving and caring mood
it is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do
dear local newspaper i agree with the people that support advances in technology
the mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning
in seconds there will be thousands thousands of results
libraries have no right to censor books
i have penfriends among intellectual artistes actors dancers scientists and university professors
the reason i said books help people is because it furthers one knowledge to understand things better
once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting
on a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people
so i say we as in the citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of
the internet can also help people find jobs
you look back and regret doing what you did
dear newspaper i disagree that computers are important to people because they have research online colleges and online stores
also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information like your social security number
also you can talk to friend
freedom is the key to any way of living
the heat will make you very tired and you will lose a lot of energy
what you can do is you can contact them over the computer webcam
the freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want
without a doubt this world is gorgeous and is worth while to see the nature
being in shape talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go
the main way of being social these days other than texting is to chat online with friends
 computers are a part of our advanced technology
nature can be spared
these things all contributed to the characters state
on several occasions my family have planned trips together even though we live across the continent
books are an important part of the learning system
computers help us communicate research different topics and have just plain fun things to do
they also get tired every easy
the decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader not the government or library or activist group
quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today
her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it
these are just some of the many ways computers are helpful
students need to use that certain information in a classroom
when getting rid of offensive books we remove history
they share them with their neighbours
but not everybody agrees on this statement
is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood
in addition they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction
will never forget his house and his gracious neighborhood and will never forget how his parent turned this simple house to a home
anyone can use the library and it is a valuable resource to many people
do you want to look up information fast
the computers bring people together
but what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child
he can jump high across a fence and run very fast
computers were mode to simply difficult situations such as typing finding  and keeping a record of financial statuses
if you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you
also some books be needed for research
the librarian says the book was removed from all public libraries because it was found offensive
computer have mark information then any book in the world
without computers everyone would not be able to get the education that they have a right to
a person who works especially with bricks stones and cement is called a mason
i was going to die
can be more opinionated mature and controversial
many children are growing up without mom or dad
you can google the book and find an online copy of the book so you make the grade on that paper
no longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world
its not only one person to decide that
computers the time they are the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can
when the snows melt and the geese return she is saying that after winter when the snows melts and when the geese returnin spring
lastly computers have cause another problem called bullying
my school library is a quiet place
for example suggest family
books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal
the setting he was in made him a little more wise
it is helpful you can discover new things and much more
when they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one
unaware at there surroundings many people zone to their computer screens and only break absolutely necessary
take abortion into perspective
it is no different with books
he describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family
living things exist with sun – light
parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading
so in conclusion my ideas where
sometimes the best thing to is get some fresh air and interact with others
first of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library
sometimes i enjoy reading books where people get hurt and sometimes killed but someone else reads itthey might think that it is horrible and very offensive
we realize what actions bring what reactions
her mother never wanted to talk about him because she knew that this way only going to make matters worse
the two friends go to the sea and get on to a ship
the phone is not always an option
i found wonderful pictures of 
the computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment
for his family and the people him
its color is white
to take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task
on the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address
dear   walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen i earning new and exciting information they can everyday
this shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it
you are probably using a computer to type the documents
we come in contact with other people traveling
however computers have more negative effects on people
they are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer
most importantly it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places
in love he shows that his parents immigrated mostly to give his children a better future
those are some examples on how they create the mood
this shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die
doing research for a paper on 
something you can see your family for webcam
sometimes though cellphones lose signal
her mother talked to her and then she felt better
it is like being in school there has many times been that one student that the rest of the class see as really different
there are a lot of books however that have been meant to put other people down
further more people are spending too much time on computers and not enough beauty of nature
it will briefly tell you that there is some content they not be appropriate that hurt feelings and simply offend
these are many reasons talking online can be better than using a phone
this story is about how parents created a home
another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are
this whole situation implied to stick to your original plan
i remember making a with my best friend back when we were in grade
people who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant for free
people who frequent the library often pick up a book not knowing what it holds
my library would have something like this in the library
dear  i feel like computers are good for you in a lot of ways
also if you find out something new tell people you can spread the knowledge
i believe in not allowing censorship in libraries
we need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them
and three because it helps us updated on what is happening in sports or everything
this lowers his confidence especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him
he is not at all considerate
here is another reason why computers are good
libraries cant please everyone
this is really bad because you were on the computer
what i mean when i say homework is when you have to type up an easy or something
also that everyone cared about everyone else
i did not know what to do i was completely clueless and i had no book to write my report over
along with the programs to write a paper you can use the internet and google to get the information
i believe computers have a positive effect on people because computers can help people in many ways
it is a very useful department for the public
if most people are upset by something it will probably start disappearing from sight
children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out that music
the author created the mood of happiness that the authors parents went through such struggle but in the end everything turned out fine because they have family
the peacock is a very beautiful bird
it could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies
over all the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy although the happiness went on through difficult times like segregation
the sun was beginning to beat down but i barely noticed
go ahead and listen you will be amazed
they know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author
why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are
secondly i would like to say computers have a great way of creation
it deals with the science of information processing invoicing recording manipulating and retrieving information
and its not just for young people to fool around with friends but adults use social network too
the author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons
there are many sick people in the world and many of them use the internet to find people
if censorship were to be equal for everyone there would be nothing left in the world to be censored
there are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written
if this is such a good environment for teenagers to be then why are they able to download bad music off of the internet
its not fair to those who want to read it
how would you explain why it was offensive
do you think that computers are useless
for starter people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising
now a world where people jog together in the park as they jog they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree
many other people also come running
i think people should be able to have a choice
some talk about nonfiction and some fiction
personally i find comfort and my sense of being alone is dulled by these books
statics show that people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with there own children or parents
people should go to the gym and build strong muscles
also i feel the libraries should rid of books that in olden times would have been a shame to read
we researched the customs the foods the way of dressing the traditional holidays and their way of entertainment
my first example is my father
even though there is racism one is friends
computers teach hand eye coordinator by training your hand to go where your brain tells it to and where your eyes show it
i can take over your life
there is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library
this is the last reason why i feel computers are bad
then my father left me in school
finding a book offensive is a simply an opinion and has no factual evidence
computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web
they help very much with education and even that alone i think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful
many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism
some people think that people use computers too much
we live in a world today where education is everything and we think that everyone should have an education
censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not
if you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the the computer would help a lot
if you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time
just out of a few broken heartstrings
lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is
his friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble which he tries
why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion
all sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore
the features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
yes students should go exercise but all the time
if every thing went by one mans rule of what to and not to read we would down grade as a country and 
people lose jobs over computers
their are many features that affected the cyclist
however a recent study shows that after computers came out more people have begun to read
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show strength and encouragement
it also a great way to make friends
if the library chooses to keep books in it that are only appropriate for certain ages groups various problems can occur
the cold weather is an obstacle for them
let our not repeat itself
everyone needs to hear it because true
censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read
soon after that he did not see anything
just another useful effect on people
but it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who wish to educate themselves on the said matters
do research or maybe just for fun play games
these books are known as  books
it is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around
why i stated that is its unhealthy for many people
so think twice about the negative comments people say about computers
second it lets people communicate with other people
man has not recognised the importance of trees
so why take that information away from me
i believe that computers are an major impact on people
it gives me the feeling that i could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger
or they can skim over it
this would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials
there are so many types of genres of music that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music
lincoln is regarded as the greatest american president
you can also communicate with people who has an email address
computers are progressing into our lives more and more
ah i love hearing my computer thunk on when i wake up
it is their right as an to buy what they want
i know that it would make me feel like i did something wrong
i believe that all the books are meant to be in the library
she has built a small nest on the roof outside my room
my grandfather has promised to take me to another museum next time he visits us
and at first they struggled but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future
the internet is a very dangerous
there are    reading book sites all on the web
then talks about delicious foods and great music
before computers and internet there were only these ways to have fun during boring times in the day
computers help you learn things better than any other technologies
so editors writers and readers
if we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion then our world would be a mess
he encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together
but also regular people for example teens do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day
you never know
another reason why they have these connections its probably because its a better way to see one another if you live in different parts of earth
also i would not care how long that i would stay in the library
also you will become a lot more interactive with people
too many books are about drugs sex or pregnancy
loving family and friends of course
people would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others
when i would watch music videos on every song that was being played was the edited version
his books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people
computers in total do not have a bad impact on people
i have tons of experiences of movies books music and magazines that have offended me
a good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy
their would be closer bonds with families if people stayed of the computer
another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water
the mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful
they can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life
but the people that enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them
in addition computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing
on the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go
also the feel of his home reflected on the mood
i know a family that has a son fighting in the 
she loves the music the food and the culture
just remember online you can be whoever you wont to be you could be only ten but say your 
last but not least you can play games on your computer
they can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them
you cant have these accounts without a computer therefore we need computers
if they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them
by using computers rather than interacting with them you are the connections you have
i do realize that it gets out of control with the music movies magazines and books but we know when to settle down and grow up
also do you remember when was the time to put the alarm clock on for 
people use the internet way to much for plans for business for entertainment for a social life
the authors should not be punished just because someone is offended by what he or she wrote
these sites give people a chance to find with old friends
one reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome the obstacle the test no matter what
never again will work be so difficult
i heard a couple nights ago that had an earthquake
this novel is about a world where all books are burnt
remember minutes of exercise minutes in the sun each day to stay really healthy
magazines movies books etc
everyone likes different things and has different views
this means that he felt he was close enough to everybody in his community it was like family
writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message
the heat lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride
well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways such learning entertainment and even weight
you would be putting someone out their job
the sign is all bright and flashy so you stop to read it
some people were standing and some others were sitting on the benches
the path of the planets is known as an orbit
you can keep up with family members and old friends
why not use it
the mood given by the author in this memoir is happiness
for example a professional photographer may be busy even in hisher leisure time
this line shows that the author was in a very hot place being in a desert but also that he has a low water supply
basically the computer and the bad wide web things to do
when you are bored you find anything that you can possibly do rather than be bored
computers are essential to our culture
so try books
the players take part in different games
freedom of speech freedom of ideas freedom of thought
public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves and everyone has a different opinion
afterwards said they felt an improvement in their mood
in conclusion i see computers as a negative effect on people
you can also conduct research on the web you with many projects
scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before
back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter
if offensive books are taken down where else will they go they are still going to be offensive somewhere else
in fact if we could scan people to find addiction of the population would be addicted to computers
if these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of will not need for everything to be censored
we should destroy the computers
in order to do this you need a web
so why take it out of libraries
all school day they talked to their friends they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy
i was doing a water depleting 
some people find bad language and themes offensive while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author
he had tumbleweed a snake and he was dehydrated
is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story
they can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer
the bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist
you can always find a library around there are no 
just how endless celebrations brought life in there warm home
i think computers is a positive effect because it can help you connect with other people from different parts of the world
why do people go to libraries
she also realized that she will never forget her home but she still can move on
a man find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him find the book funny and joke about it
it is one of my most prized possessions
computers are also good for you
censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all citizens
would you ask for to be removed
does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because one is offended
trust me i got addicted to a game before
from reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person
that can tell you where the uncensored parts are
people also use computers for home work online
so i hope i have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children
secondly which everyone needs is another important thing to look into
its also because there is very little water left for him
climate location and population all have an effect on the cyclist
so when you watch a movie to listen to music and think it wrong someone right around the corner think that its just normal
the features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist
it was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner
some come to get away and to others its a daily routine
now that fact bring me to my next point
hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know
when he was a
studying and school work
the author set a mood for this memoir
the author concludes the hibiscus is important to her
then with in two days there would be not books left
libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public
the setting effects the cyclist very much
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy
i for one completely agree with this quote
for instance when your in gym class you want to be healthy
the question is do you want people to refrain from using computers
i also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book
you think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did
these materials not be offensive to some people but it can be to others
by taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there that the world is perfect and there is no wrong
did you know that from being on the computer all the time you lose focus on exercising anymore
we starve ourselves to try to be skinny
 the less interesting title is what your news will change to if people keep using computers
and last but not least computers take away from peoples family life and cause them to split up and become unhappy
our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch
although censored books have a great story behind them the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs
some people thrive off of these things
there are relaxed moods to explain the feelings he had for his life and there was even harsh moods to show the tough times they went through and such
the features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures
its like a new way to be home schooled
finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends
the library a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out
my advise to libraries keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area away from younger people who react strongly
computers can help with our educational needs
i think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out
there is hope that spring will come flowers will come birds will come
the tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book
furthermore computers are on advancement in technology that this uses constantly
in my opinion i think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons
censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books
although the cyclist remained determined to find water he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store
not only do computers less on unhealthy life style it also causes spend less time with family and friends
and video games
the feeling that the uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had
so please do not censor our libraries
the descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey
some people think that certain book movies magazines or music should be removed from libraries because they be found offensive
once that child becomes and adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library
are we not a for the people by the people
they be considered censorship but that is one step away from being banned
i feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books magazines or 
i received my uncle
things like exercise socializing and homework matter
each library decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location
finally computers give people the ability to talk to other people online
she was lazy and never wanted to exercise
but its also making there life very in healthy
if it offends you just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out
although those parents that do not approve of this can go to a different library
so i think it depends on the situation
he wants to try new things
i love to go to the market as my mother busy me goodies like candies and cakes
but not the land has changed and the directions were wrong
if we take peoples choice away what are they going to have
lastly in paragraph  he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills
i believe that computers have a great effect effect on people
first off we can benefit from computers because we can learn new things
adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them
not only can computers help you with information it can make school projects so much easier
these are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday
so much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous
thank you for your time
we now live in a world where everyone voices their opinion freely and you can not be punished for doing so
dear all computer lovers i do think you are all spending too much time on the computer
you grow older it becomes more work and with a computer you will have less weight on your shoulders
some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions
also it lets you communicate with family of friends in case of emergencies
i just so happen to agree
even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside the user would be focusing on the screen not what is around them
not only that but the life of kids have been threatened and taken by it
that line shows they were brave and willing to try something new they cared for their child
last but not least would be 
if people cut back the amount of time indoors we could probably bring that number way down
even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer
it a snake was in the road then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road
censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the 
my first reason is talking online
jim also get his freedom with finn’s help
it has been amazing how computers help us so much
computers are used for research socializing and almost all of our work is done on computers
language usage in music is also a big deal
all of those computer related things would not there for there were no computer
my mom is always on face book and i hate it i figure she loves the computer more then do you want your kids to think that about you
in order for more people to maintain healthy there needs to be a lot of 
i think that computers detach people from reality create false personas and has no physical benefit
but on the other hand we do not want your children getting hold to the censorship of bad book movie music or magazines
we all love him a lot
she always tries to keep the house neat and clean
computers have a positive effect on people
some ways the cyclist was affected is the lack of water was the biggest problem he had
for example books that would be found offensive to children should be kept away from where children can pick out things in a library
my last reason is that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people but they have books for that too
then  what is originally a sign of hope because another let down
if this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology then your crazy
this was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways
and gets there in less then a minute
the internet is also a good way to stay in contact with close friend or relative
sometimes we will even video chat
first of all the weather causes most of his problems
and to play games
with different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things
people should spend a lot less time on their computer
the sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive
instead of hiring someone to make at make it yourself
there are many other reason why computers have a positive effects of people
secondly talk to family and friends without having to spend money
in a way this makes sense
first of all i think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected
if we get rid of certain books we get rid of certain history as well
the flower also represents adapting to a new place
your children are without a doubt through the ones a by this technical revolution the most
so the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him
online where anyone can go on there are millions of people that are not connected or related
or put the books some people find offensive in there own area
you need to think this way
people from ages of school kids to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist use computers
needs to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach
i personally think at a certain age they need to know about this stuff
simply follow the rating rules
i think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had
computers do have an effect on us but in a good way
then in no time you will be hanging out with your friend
use the internet
then for young adults i think that parents could try to look up somethings about the book
books newspapers tell the truth about a subject
children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out
somebody is always going to get hurt
right now she be sad and scary but she knows that things will work out and she will be fine
next  i am going to talk to you about making friends just with a computer
all the machines that we have to use and had to run by hand now run by computers
the cyclist describes there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
again this argument might go both ways meaning one less book would be off the shelf or many would be newly stacked aside from the others
this brought his hopes down
some people believe that some of the books magazines and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene
certain material in this world maybe offensive to their own kind
but books from before this practice began to happen be found more offensive then books today
this answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness
but it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read
the flower outside in the cold must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive
there are many reasons for this but one big reason is because they sit in front of computers all day
 the computer to me is very beneficial
some students were busy fishing
i know that if i was having trouble with sports for a long time i would give up
students can now type out all assignments some schools even give laptops to students to use throughout the year
we as a society do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released
well the computer is a great source for learning about these places
by doing this we can learn what life is like for them
another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him
this quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride
we live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read watch and listen to
people will be amazed
everyone hates when their camera or video camera breaks and will their precious and wonderful memories are gone
all in all computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the 
you are what you eat is what i say
yes people shall spend time outside or with family in small does the computer good for you
what is offensive in libraries
the cyclist is worried he is not yet depressive and pessimistic
do you ever go outside anymore
if you want to go to the movies or on vacation you can get the movie tickets online
another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism
he wanted to take me along
next the web is also used for keeping in contact
he often quarrels with others over small things but soon forgets about it
there still time for change so lets do something about it
dear local newspaper opinion on the effect of computers are that it depends on how much you use the computer
computers also help yet work done
lastly many people do research on the internet
i think has gotten out of hand how much people and teens especially are addicted to computers
the sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room
the store market is also run on computers
while some people think were not wasting our time on the computer
i have an uncle named  that has little girls
this can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella
of people learned a dictionary there own using the internet
it shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy
are they amazing or what
i believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head
you might end up being lonely
we have our constitution we know our rights now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them
the eldest son helps him in the business
the boat was quit spacious though not a very big one
when the hibiscus has blossomed her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin
do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help
spring and snow melting could be connected to rebirth while the geese returning could symbolize a second chance
outside of school there is so much more to learn
no i do not believe that
friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you
some students not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student
so it has been here over years it going away
we need to decide whether computers have positive or negative effect on people
computers are fun and educational
movie contains a profanity every other word so it seems
finally computers benefit society have the ability to locate missing people
computers can help people meet new people online
seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort
if we removed everything that was offensive today
eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
that quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him
then their going to go tell there friends what they heard because they think its cool then all kinds of kids are hearing it
without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily
some of us carried fruits some carried cakes and some carried snacks
publishers do read the books they publish them they will not publish any random thing
we came back home after a few hours
the next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass
advances in technology are great
information is open to those that search for it and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results
finally you know how computers affect people
the lights in our houses glow with the help of electricity
she said that rich sweet scent that was familiar too
the definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please
for example if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in they could do so with a click of a mouse
we should not start swimming without thinking about our experience and depth of the river
he told himself that it was no use
it goes along with me in the morning
when ever i do my homework
what have you been taught
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
by stressing this warmth it meant that it created memories
i think it was happy because it says he loved to cook and he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook
the veterans then might want the movie taken of the shelves
i believe that if a person is over the age of  they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored
keep reading to find out more
this has a great effect on the cyclist both physical and emotional
i felt like i was right their with her
so next time anything else just think the other options
it got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated
first it lets you friends and family
it lets you see how people are and what the place looks like with a virtual tour
they made more than the and the company makes the mostly used computer system
the narrator is grateful for all the great times in life him and his parents had together
that is one less hour of exercise
the mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood
the narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding
their are also on line like the and magazines like time
i never knew what it felt like or how did it feel
do we have the right to take books
likewise computers help us see places that are amazing
what is this though
it could also help people find their 
then  who is in the same class as  was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on
the setting was rough
so when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them
it is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy
in conclusion i think people should spend more time exercising hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers
that is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip
this is a movement that should change the opinion of many do people spend to much time on computers
i think computers are a great of technology because of the information they can provide
usually computers can do much more good than bad and can make a persons life much easier
articles about views on the death penalty
with all these obstacles in his way he was able to achieve his goal of getting water
in my school there are several students with special needs
it is like removing something just because one person does not like it
they gave up everything they had for her
also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
he has passed his middle school examination
the earth gets heat light and energy from the sun
well i think the mood of the story is great
if every single person was able to ban one book in the  what would we have left
it started to drizzle
secondly the internet is very easier then books
now a days out of people are over weight or obese
most of the time the true facts will always be there
this shows the generosity of his parents and the author is trying to create a loving mood
maybe even more curtains for your room
another car with red and blue stripes was following close behind
our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward
i also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades
for example when she said then i will take that test again
children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also
he thinks they have gone up because instead students reading long boring article on someone or something they can just search it on the internet
also the parents and child need to spend time together if they are both on the computer they cant spend time together
they help us learn about far away places they help us with our school work and the let us communicate with other people online
the only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines
the features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry not populated area
that is how the feature affected the setting
people are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
the first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new
i would be surprised if one does not
when she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home
with this concluding paragraph i believe that she will be more comfortable at the time
if that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it
the entire nation had become reliant on computers
they say that for people to talk online with other people
in opinion i benefit people using computers
who knows we might have to vote on it someday
if some people want to fill their mind with filth let them
i not saying that books should be removed off the shelf just maybe put up higher and be watched over more carefully
to wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home
the next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions
by concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test
i root out the unwanted plants
where did this inspiration come from
we have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are
i can mess up your social life with family and friends
second the computer causes you to interact with people less
the author  uses many curses in the dialogue between characters
also you can forget the steps of how to do something on your project or homework so you check online
the author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up
if you are a responsible person then you are fine
my last reason why i say that you should spend more time with your family is because you could learn a lot about you family
you need to relax and just take a brake
 in the computers have help man kinds
offensive things have been around in libraries probably since the first library opened
computers should be used less
by traveling to and unfamiliar places in the world one is able to experience and learn about other cultures
sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it
she really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring she will have new energy to take the test again
they might think that it takes away time from nature friends and family
in this memoir the author is showing the mood as happiness
writing many different essays letters typing for projects and doing research would be done faster and easier
also books are usually funnier to read
with computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like
he was determined to make it to the next town
one last reason computers are beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs
materials should not be removed from libraries
after all do we really need a computer
there are positive things about the computer and as well as negative things
dear newspaper i think computers have a good effect on people
  these were the moods the author expressed in the memoir
they should stop the computer games
i think that knowing that everyone is different and special in their own way should show that everyone is going to enjoy different things at different levels
computers can also be addicting
at one point in the story the author writes that he was trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
first off many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not
that the parent has to sign before that says  child can see or hear the materials being displayed
finally my last point computers make it very easy to make plans or connections
if you hear someones music and it sounds completely awful to you then just walk away or listen to your own music
a recent study showed that of kids would rather be bullied in face then over the internet
study show that an average spends in total hours a day on the computer almost double what they should be spending on it
as for myself i am one of those on the side of which is for computers
he is very intelligent
computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge
you can do two things you can panic and let everyone down you can go or the internet and save
what about entertainment
next all her thanking shows her being grateful
these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you
for example the computer is actually good for education
these are all bad affects computers have but their not all bad without them life might be a little harder
ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section
this also means that there are smaller incisions being made so that means a faster recovery
it was the first time that i had gone to such a place
computers allow you to go on game sites watch videos or movies or play on online game on just a regular game
someone enjoy a piece of work another finds offensive
my second reason is to talk on the 
books are a very important part of most peoples daily lives
recently it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers
everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life
perhaps we learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so
video games make you think that is also reason they are good
the author is giving a message not to give up
that is the same with magazines books and anything available at a library
typing is a quick and fairly simple way to write that saves people valuable time
we are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies
all low lying areas had knee deep water
with computers a business in or somewhere else in can be connected with a building in 
dear readers i understand some people are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and that it is bad
we are promised the freedom of speech as well as press and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both
everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies
either that of the towns said to be a ghost town
what is the big issue over censoring movies disks books and magazines
creates this mood by using various words and phrases
all of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel
what gave them the right to decide what their people could or could not read
these are my reasons i think computers are important and positive to people
overall i believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years
the article was about the negative effects computers have on the community
so what are you doing readers
getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer
it is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer
once child read an article  book
it might create a certain image
new styles they make more money they make
computers are a big part of the working society today
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
without offensive books for the public to read will create a better environment for the people living today
a material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people
as the fireman burnt books so ironically the novel was censored
that indicates a new beginning or starting over
unfortunately it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority
please  we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have
i would have learned not only how to express and accept myself but i might have grown to more easily accept others as well
they could put in it in the back and whoever wants it and go ask for it
well to begin my persuasive 
people take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt
computers just add to list of excuses not to do anything
of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one
it is just a life story
they think it is too explicit but another not
he is talking about how he had such a good life in the house
one of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like kidnaps
if there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink
it brings us backwards in time makes us fear
in conclusion you understand what you can and cannot read
that is how many people feel when reading that kind of material
also to get pictures
in my letter going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society
books about drugs are alright to an extent
finally i think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake
our kids and future kids do not need to be learning about these sort of things
say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading
and with this family came the good times
many people find this offensive
if someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion so be it
dear local newspaper i am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers
dear local newspaper do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer
the people do not need to look at something that they find offensive
being a fan of her i would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool
she felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive
i thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines
in letter i will explain
in my opinion some materials are not too low in rating and should not be for people under age
i can see how some of those books could be banned
for example say one library have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action
children go there and pick movies out
college is important because it has a big role in our life so we earn great jobs
the computer is a great way to learn about things but it also a great way to become a junkie and fat
and how important family and friends are
change the radio station
it is a fact that you can survive without a computer
my friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework
instead of being on computers i think it would be best to spend time with your family
points are scored by throwing the ball into the basket fixed at each end of the court
individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe
i also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help
the author of the memoir is thankful of her parents and to the rest of her family
but some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature type book
at night he goes on the round the area
but do all these  exercise plans really work
this last line represents many things
every student gets a take home project at social point in the time of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils
for these reasons the author created the mood of happiness in his memoir
there are many verses and songs written about their beauty an innocence
what i am to tell you is that computers help students with school work like projects
about three years ago i went on vacation to 
most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult
he solves the difficulties of all the students regarding their lessons
there are always an opposing side
computers are one of the great inventions we have
there are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them
to them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other
we see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying
no these types of things are everywhere
in conclusion i believe computers effect our society in a positive way
through everything they had been through
the author creates a special mood in this memoir
it was breezy with shade from trees and rivers
if someone wants there opinion to be read they should have that right
hes in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because hes anticipating another one
he is happy about how they invited many people over for dinner and because of this they made many friends
many people who spend most of their time on the computer are or became obese
men and women go to public libraries to learn
the television has inappropriate shows on it all the time yet everyone can have access to it if they chose to
 in my opinion the effects of computers are not good
i personally do not think that books music movies or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive
when we meet up catch
with graph making software you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest
so it just depends on the situation
there were long queues
this mood is great and shows anyone can be happy
if so you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability
each and every citizen has the right to read whatever they please to
how would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys
i think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change
also social networking sites help families keep in touch
a poem novel or even a short story these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf
i chuckled this shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh
these experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature and interact with family and friends more
the cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across
these are some reasons that show how this memoir has a peaceful mood given by the author who wrote it
it would of taken me forever to there so instead i went online and talked to him
but i know this because its says then i will take that test again her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant
it has some what gossip
so think are computers really harmful
you could probably find whatever you want on the internet
movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience
most people used computers
are great for kids in libraries
he then goes on his bike to the park taking their shortcut
many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is
you will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat
another health risk is having bad eyes
my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers
the specialist advised him complete rest
you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers
what might be offenses to you be enjoyable to someone else
most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections
after that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens
the feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her
do people have the right to limit imagination
these are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye
know you know that i think that computers need to be seen less throughout the human day
some features that are mentioned in the story are heat rough road long crippling hills and a abandoned grape juice factory
the features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways
the music was always playing and family came a lot
level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into
it takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected
a farmer lives in a village
i had never seen such a beautiful place and so i was very excited
well knowing this truth does not stop the victims from getting attracted by this media stunt
so i think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad chose for this
a farmer lives a simple life
they form a healthy part of our diet
even if there is a book that people agree should be censored there are people that think the other way
there are always passengers at the bus stops
shows moviesand music they all have something not suitable for all audiences
your family is always their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day
computers and technology benefit us in many ways
everyone likes to watch movies jam to some music and get lost in an interesting book
children that have read books or watched inappropriate media can sometimes change how they are like
my parents always kept their arms  their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us
the heat terrain and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story
dear  people are using computers all the time but computers help us all the time in positive ways
you can shelter your children if you would like
you can make website and you can watch movie and show online
people on the internet can do anything they want
and your an learn a lot from computer
this is why computer are an obstruction to us
lets say that i had a work document on yearly company profits and i needed to got it to my boss
one of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information
when someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely
absolutely nothing but to teach them to take them home and show there little brother or sister a cuss word in the book is teaching them bad things
if so you must enjoy it
rash driving causes accidents
a library is a place to sit and enjoy the surroundings
so everyone i strongly encourage you to reconsider what could happen without computers
i recently visited and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them
you will find all this in the computer
everyone is titled to their own opinions
so you should really be consider judging the skills of the computer they really do help in life
if the libraries take away the offensive material is just like talking a good book from you
it was their idea to put it in the story but some things need to be left unsaid
the readers can learn from mistakes made in the past
he had resorted to gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth just to keep his mind his thirst
that is why i think computers are necessary
he becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong not all that could get better
in the future we are going to see more and more computers
kid or if your an adult
at one point in the story she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories
from a survey of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis and at baseball then others
to conclude the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives
most of my friends do it with me
we should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening
it is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content
finally from what you experienced
it also teaches oodles of information
he recalls past neighbors and surrogate grandparents his aunts and cousins
choose it because it looks interesting and its something you might enjoy
their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family
some people say computers distract you from friends when really they help you talk to your friends more
you could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds
its because it means so much to them
the computer or great way to find a job
so is censorship wrong
owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too
there are eight planets in our solar system
among the animals we can include goats lambs hares or rabbits also
it reunites lots of family  friends you might have been looking for
finally it allows people to talk online with other people
our media is too intertwined with our lives
last but not least you enjoy spending time with the ones you love but seem to busy because your on the computer all day
computers are good for last minute situations
is mentioned in the last paragraph
they wont enjoy their life outside of their houses
my final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer
censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history but necessary when protecting the young
i use the computers to better understand it
there mostly for older teens and grown ups
yes i understand some of this material be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this
there are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive
he once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around
it is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students
if we can do that our world would be a much better place
more than of most students in an average school have one
in conclusion the author created in mood through this memoir that family has many different meanings
perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children
nothing really all to serious i guess
when she says the test she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland and overcome it
by using the computer people are getting less exercise not enjoying the nature and not interacting with family or friends
the terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water
so yet why do we keep these books in our libraries
in places like libraries you never know who might come in to check something out
how people do you know that met someone or has a friend on the computer
he easily passes the snake and moves on
you have to be yourself at the end of the day
she felt alone and that she would die
what about the adults
first is heat
first the heat dehydrates and exhausts him almost causing him a heat stroke
sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face
i think that this was a really good mood to set in a story
the in the story is happy this is because he got to move to the and be born hear for a better life
like what kind of clothes they wore food they ate place the lived in
lastly if you are getting ready to go on a trip you can check flight information with the click of a button
he said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop
i understand that there is reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of some sexual content
we as people have the right to learn read and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us
so if something happen who would know
what we do believe in or think is what makes us ourselves
everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right
son of a poor farmer
you guys can chat each other check up on each other and see how everyone is doing
many sports teams like the use this
libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who
the books were created to provide people kids especially with facts that no one else could share and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge
in conclusion i think that people would be more from using computers this is because it is easier to work with
  people are using computers more often
these materials are made to entertain someone some are entertained by offensive material
feature is the heat
also most younger kids that go there are always with an adult
lastly there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
last but not least computers are not only a fine tool for school but are necessary to succeed with your education
this made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions
why not
a computer many family thing
the world is exposed to offensive material everyday
many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life
everyone grows up in a different lifestyle
there was a mood created by the author in memoir
if something was removed from the shelf at a library because someone found it offensive i would be disturbed
in conclusion is a very useful thing
my school is very good about this they see one flag it and put it in the back  but they still let you read it
that is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive
the libraries for some are the main means for getting books
revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed
sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing and discovering the real world
have them grow up the way they want to grow up
another reason why i believe censorship is wrong is different people have completely different opinions on things
should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive
throughout the year use billions of sheets of paper to write letters
also if you had nobody to talk to one time you go on the computer and try to meet new people
he carries a stick and whistle in his hand
to me this is an image of selling sex
some people like myself even have friends from different countries
i hope that this opens up many peoples eyes
these changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate
music be found most offending now days but music is also away of getting emotions and freedom of speech out
he is also grateful for his parents love and sacrifice
now a world where every country got along because of online friendships
keep adult videos out of site and reach of children
the setting of do not exceed posted speed limit places the cyclist in a life threatening situation
another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns
some people be against censorship in libraries but there often is not censorship in bookstores movie stores music libraries etc
computers do help you
the mood is set on this paragraph
you can also learn about far away places like 
i know worried
despite such discomfort this information should not be hidden from anyone
he hardly noticed the sun was beginning to beat down
without a doubt i firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction
and parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying
i think think the better can your health
if they spend too much time on the computer they are more likely to fail their classes
if they offend you then do not read them
why should this freedom not apply to books
words colors and sizes can all be round on a computer all by learning
they could have a decrease in sales which would cause a decrease in money as well
also people use computers for work and jobs
then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice
in conclusion computers are a necessity to our living
some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act
another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper just a click away
all of usmyself my father mother sister and younger brother clambered in the boat
it shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore
in the story rough road ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about
library  or bad
she had failed the driving test
my final reason is also very helpful
these library materials are all part of the worlds past and all have a bigger story behind it which has an even bigger story behind it and so on
we should never fight with our friends instead we should be polite helpful and friendly towards everyone
no one is ever going to be able to control what our youth see
when a book is banned a piece of history is removed from others sight
some of my observations that i have seen were not really good
there are most likely books that one person could find offensive but others do not
i hope that you can see it my way and help me in fixing this issue once and for all
the mood that was created by the other was happy
also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date
another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information
in conclusion these moods are the examples of the memoir
once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages
limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world
in the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture
but now more and more people think its a waste of time
no i do not think that some of these materials should be removed
we would need a computer to type it to make it looks better
in the story always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile
computers as you can see have both good and bad effects
would you really try to prevent your child friends and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day
surprisingly another thing you can do is work online by setting it up at work or telling your boss how to do it
if your on the computer most of the time at home how would you get your exercise
and by hitting the key you want you are learning this
so these i the easiest and fastest way to project
when you sit and watch computer your eyes starts to hurt
and with no town for water he would be thirsty
last a good way to protect this country
in this memoir the author created a mood of what it was like in his childhood home
especially if they are not hurting anything or anyone physically
or playing  you are addicted to the it can also interfere with family events sports
any of the things that they read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet
these choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood
some street beggars are thieves who cheat people and steal their things
the internet is an extraordinary invention that is very simple and helpful to use
she is finally settling into her new life and says that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now
these people have a shorter lifespan
elephants are the largest land animals on the earth
we could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips water is a big importance
when it comes to any of the mentioned items sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves
i know your thinking to yourself
generally school children should have ambitions
you can chat with people from across the world
the aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him
dear local newspaper name is in the grade in in 
do i find it offensive to some
since technology is advancing more and more people are going out to buy computers
people against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family however this is not true
do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it
you want kids to be over weight like i was
those are a moods in the memoir
in conclusion you can see the negative effect computers have on people
to prove the point let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place
one way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life
the ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey
hello i decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers and how they benefit society
to conclude does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings
you can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master
the hibiscus is also a symbol of her life
this is why it should stop it hurting are environment people are becoming lazy
it helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything
and how important my family is to me
do people take offensive books serious
the computer has programs that are used to prepare articles essays slide shows and brochures for presentation as well
after all it is your life and you get to choose the way you want your children to act
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
mr david and the members of his family are very cooperative and helpful
in conclusion no i do not think libraries should be censored
yes i do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf
and the guy dad invited to come was 
but i have to leave my bed
i mean people are too busy looking up things on the web that nobody can truly appreciate
this can not only make the public upset but can possibly lead to the author getting fired
we get newspapers early in the morning
this then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students
in conclusion the computers
my grandparents came from montreal to attend my birthday party
being so happy made this such a warm home in 
the toys of japan were liked very much by the children
that will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will
and it can teach you things too
you could do lots of other stuff than lay on the computer
people connect with each other through the computer
most kids by the age of have already used a computer for over hour
is a free online application that you can download to your computer add your friends and video chat
lets say that you need to look something up the thing you always go to for information is a computer
you can see them and talk with them
now movies should not be in libraries at all libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to
as i was not well he took my brother
who would have thought computers can have effect for people
i this because and family
also changed are the plants
i myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted
their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer
the real question is though is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people
dear local newspaper you know that every out of obese children spend or more hours a day on a computer
dear local newspaper i think that computers are great for our society
and on computers you could go on everything like     and even work on the computer
it takes time away from the outdoors exercising and family
say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music
i enjoy every genre of music and books
it was a hot desert and he needed something to drink
also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends
everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them
people be able to censor books but no one can censor life
maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored
they are also avoiding nature outside and losing contact with family and friends
our is written on the pages of literature
he plows the fields
many jobs these days typically banks rely on using the internet most of the time and some actually are based in the internet
as long as okay to watch or lesson to
the only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity
he said that what they did was a more courageous thing than he could have ever done
then  as easily as rounding a bend my troubles thirst and fear were all behind me
and if he is not and with no water he probably could barely make it up the hills
computers also help you learn new things like typing skills
they can the wanted with one click
the computer is a very reliable source for me and you have lost a lot if you do not agree with me on this
is there movies music magazines books and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some
if a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive then that certain genre can be avoided
it will still be around
i feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society are right
library materials must be checked
they have a critical knocking on their front door
they also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your such as comprehension clinic
man does not live by bread alone
when it’s time to get a job having done sports could be an added qualification
for example they do taxes paperwork airline tickets and the bank
she wants to take the test again change to see if over time things have changed
how does this relate to libraries you might ask
i have many friends living in  and many cousins in   over
it is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel versus the exceptional writing style
in a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason
it is a lovely thing to be perfectly loyal to a friend
and with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success
the computers have gone to far now
without computers i never would have learned so much about that place
no one should we withheld from a book due to age race gender or any other factor
in the memoir the reader expresses the love and gratitude towards his parents
