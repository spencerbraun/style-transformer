so i think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves
however it comes to literature and and art i think that a variety makes us unique
he remembers his parents love for cooking and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him
that is why computers have a negative affect on people when their face is glued to a computer
there is no point
it is called tools
the girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes
in the story the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride
that is why i honestly believe computers do not benefit my community
the author of this memoir creates a warm loving lively and festive mood as he describes his home
all this things factor in
the way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm happy and pleasant mood
my class teacher received me
i liked the book but was sadbut i read because people were talking about 
perhaps some day your child will get a job working in on office where they must use computers all day long
they get addicted to that watching
your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated
books are gateways to other worlds
computer  they are the replacement
that is a question that i have yet to find the solution to
books videos art does not harm people
the setting of the cyclist was harsh the weather was too intense to be cycling your heart out all day 
this line describes the mood as extremely loving and touching because he is showing how much love he dedicates to his parents for the life he lived
another reason students use is to look up information for reports
i think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing
my last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight
first since he was in a desert the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts
do you know where your family comes from
working citizens use computers to help them with important jobs
if someone got offended by what they read they could put the book down just as fast as they picked it up
lastly the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day
she looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad
in high school we were told by our parents that we should not smoke do drugs or anything like that
i think computers work because it helps people with there own work
this is wrong and immoral
because the have a person there looking for they have the computer to look on
everyday more and more people use computers
his duties are very hard
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
if scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them
a world without books
i would do a observation on all the books that we had in our library
however many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet
finally a relative is away you can still talk to your uncle or grandma the relationship just gets better
three main reason as to why i think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are is a very big issue
the setting of the authors shortcut effected his performance and strength tremendously 
if i had better hand writing i would have gotten a better grade
look for something else more interesting to you
the setting of this story greatly affects the cyclists attitude and adversities
the same with magazines
the first step to changing that is to set the standards high
you cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer
this is an important concluding message because it shows that the author will overcome obstacles in her future
please let them keep teaching
technology keeps on upgrading
that is debatable but by the same token in school we must learn about the despite the fact that it upsets many people
creating a link all around the world people can find out information about one another and learn what they are all about
computers can be both good and bad
another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because hes pretty much dehydrated
a final mood would be happiness
airports make for the government and internet less people would travel
a third reason why i think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time
also his friends could come over too
its the best way for people to learn what life is really like
magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes
after the sun sets he returns home
the internet has all sorts of fun games and websites
the author concludes winter hibiscus with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life
the mood of the memoir by is love and compassion for his parents
censorship is wrong especially in the  the citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press
therefore i would not be able to read as much
i do believe that certain materials should be taken of the shelves if they are found offensive
life already has enough distractions in it why add another distraction
if you were to write a book and somebody says you cant put a certain word
the effects on nature and people are horrible
the mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir
i think censorship in libraries is wrong
instead you can exercise
in more general terms the grants freedom of expression
the mood that the author created was very happy and full of joy
there were many shops in a row
becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences
a lot of people use computers today
with how the human race is everyone is going to hear something bad or even see something
i do not agree with the fact that computers are a good part of society
also the computers become the center of their lives
you could always try that
if you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives
growing up in a small town where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless
did not finish
the features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot
now multiply that number by itself for all the people they know and multiply it again and so forth
he is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared
once some freedoms are removed others will follow
that day i learned one important lesson
these encounters create an interesting meal
i believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library
like the basic theory of
this book changes the way many people think and so do many more books
of course not
he advises us in every moment of difficulty
they teach help stay in touch and are not addicting
there were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed
more than half the world have these communication source because one it easier and you get more of your mind
i also think that is where most of the stuff kids pick up are from the music they want to listen to its horrible
she started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage
but when they do move its to get something to eat or go get their phone
either way games on the computer are too addicting
obviously internet is a great socializing activity
certain books should be removed from the library because of the materials an the stuff they show to younger children
what actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see
we can learn about many things from computers
as a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read
it affects school work and how they behave
a whopping of internet users use sites like or 
what about you
to one might argue that  the that stood by was loved by 
if movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly
if the people want to read or watch or listen to bad stuff they can its not other peoples choice
but the three ways that i have chosen to tell you about in this letter i feel have impacted us the most
computers have made our generation very intelligent
the wildlife also had an impact on him
computers take time away from spending time outside or exercising
people have the right to read anything and to see anything they want and if they disagree well they should just deal with it
this gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic
i know plenty of people who type their feeling because they would never dare say them a loud
staring at a computer screen for a long amount of time will not keep you fit or in shape
they help get new 
there are many different things in the media that is shown everyday that is very offensive
my third reason to why i feel we should keep computers is
you find something offensive but it might not be to someone else
think about you opinion does anyone care about what you think
even after that were more problems
examinations cannot thus be removed
i helps us get updated on current events shows things that we want to do and shows us how to do it
they should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area
i consider it a sin to waste money on personal pleasures
i remember my friend telling me about her new dog i never even heard of
and its quick
so i say the computer is important in our society
there are books about every single subject in the world
but because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse
those sections were created for a reason
i think that because of many reasons and i will tell you some of these reasons
you could probably find one in a common household
teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each
everyone is person is  this much we can agree on
a fresh start with the drivers test
violence is an act of the beast
but because it is a series should it be removed from shelves
the first books material is very well written and have offensive material in it here and there
some of the information on the computer is very helpful but you can never really know what information is inaccurate
with the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
in fourth grade girls are required to watch a video on the topic of puberty and in fifth grade many girls begin to go through these changes themselves
dear whomever it concern name is and i think that the effects that computers have on people is not good
the world would be upside down without them
every where you go you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices
dear  i do not think people use the computer to much
not many people including me would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these
i just think that that is a waste of time when you basically have everything you need twenty foot away
i remember my older sister had to do some research on  the computer gave her all of the information she needed
think a head years from 
should taking books music and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned
a few include research communication and to have fun
the computer is a positive advance in society and everyone should be assured so
yes i believe that books movies music and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are offensive and inappropriate
censorship in a library should not be allowed
but again goes back to the will power or the want to to go back and do the test a second time
they make the most money off of them
and if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and title to read and watch
both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person
we type something and we use our eyes to look at the screen and then our hands to type one mistake and automatically our hand fix it
the rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water
when you have sex you have to make sure you are safe
love and sacrifice is the mood throughout the memoir that the author created
go experience nature
this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood
it cause trouble but just set your mind to it and you can help and solve problems when you do set your mind to it
this way i am my friends and relax
from the frying pan to the fire was never truer than in this case
taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read
libraries should remove this material from their shelves
crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind
censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day
in this passage is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family
he begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water
this means you will have time for anything
she buys a hibiscus and plants it when she comes home after noting the geese flying south for the winter
many young kids some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old go to parties and drink
the author proves and says how we as grateful
and that is why i think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir
i thought that they were good ideas though
also you can waist lots of energy to
i also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard
i also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument
this would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty
find and create ways to making money or interesting positive out comes out of using person in this world goes in and thru out tech equip
crank  and is a trilogy of books that show the life of 
who cares if someone is black or white
this is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast
you can even webcam with people
throughout the story he mentions the lack of water
it should be made habit
is clear that if you want to stay healthy computer usage should be limited
why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun
it is up to you to continue using computers
caring and always being there for each other and loving each other is just as important then having the same 
at midday we have a recess
offensive materials contain many teaching tools in life that could help out the lives of many people
although our entertainment today is much different then it was back then and will be much different than it will be in the future
computers are also a huge help on a project school or work some peoples jobs they are required to use computers
the mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft happy and mood
because of some of the programs like  or  i am able to converse with cousins
one reason is that you can explore things at home
some music might not be the best choice for a young child
the author in the memoir tried to create a specific mood
kids now find many internet sites online online more interesting than hanging out with family and friends
lastly you can talk online with other people
as you can see computers rule
scientists say that about of all have communicated with someone at least once through computers
that way you can be sure who you are talking to
but are books
thank you for listening
i disagree with this statement
it is this that makes us think and therein lies the problems with censorship
so i strongly you to vote being a negative effect
there are people out there that might disagree with me and i can see where they are coming from too
children should not read or watch anything that are talking about drugs in a positive way
on the computer
having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is
simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch
you have there are two things you can do in that situation
this quote shows that for his parents loving him he gives them love
i believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that should be removed from the shelf
computers have gotten more advanced over time
do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family
one time i went into the library and i picked out a book about a haunted house
i listen to music all the time as long a i like the way it sounds
honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight
at the computer
also the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast
well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings materials and movies
spending time with your family can be great fun as i recently discovered
they did not go to study then and confined themselves to house duties
without being noticed
internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain and attack you to all the websites and neat little things
you can save you picture download music play games
but is there really anything they can do
a library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves
young boys are snagged early their futures now controlled by this disease
he has a farm
it is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on
they would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive
if someone is thinking about going to then they would probably go on the internet to learn about 
well if you have this is called sexting
you can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web
it is in january
books movies and music are all the same
when they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight but they never do it
first of all computers help us stay in contact with the other countries around the world
it gives them great pleasure to see them happy and satisfied
with a computer you could research anywhere you want and make that trip the best days your life
consequently certain people use computer because the help you with certain things
it brings us news and views from all corners of the world
if books are taken off a shelf what does that mean to us people
many individuals are spending too much on their computer and less time working out or exercising
a misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess
here crime is not glorified
such areas are dry sandy and very hot
what happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf
computers has a negative effect on people
racism can cause people to feel very hurt also
the setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live
reason number one why i say people are spending to much time on the internet is because it is dangerous
so in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him
i use the computer for mostly everything i do
he regained hope and moved ahead
all sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around
you can use it for research organization and business matters
the reasons why be people would be less active people will not interact well  people enjoy nature
most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
we should take a stand and get rid of these bad books
this kept me very entertained
the features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns
books help people in many ways
the made the mood in this memoir a nice feeling story and a motivating story
the quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children
staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong
there are many advantages to computer but there are also disadvantages
being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out
the mood of the memoir is warm happy and sweet thanks to the author
also the setting seems to be very hot
if it was not for libraries the people in society would not be as smart as they are
this gives you a feeling of the home being warm comfortable and most of all alive
she has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in
it was during class that we visited the library to look at various books
this was why the setting was affecting the cyclist
taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them
she is very careful of our hygiene
and hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society
most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past
with computers you can also keep information down
if you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them talk to them about it
everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions
a computer can really the of your life
dear local newspaper do you keep in touch and do computers effect your job
he would live on telling people not to listen to old men
finally stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers
while trying to please everyone some people find some of the material offensive
there are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework
during this time they could be exercising going to the gym or even taking a walk with friends
some people have to be on the computer all day
i myself have read the 
what if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up
my opinion is when you have to for a test quiz or anything if can become boring
but many would disagree with that
if the average person tried
the feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph  when the author talked about his family
fresh air is very important for plants and animals too
there were vivid flashes of lightning
computers can be good but not for everything in your life
many people have different views on censorship
another thing is there are online courses now for students
most people today neglect punctuality
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
lastly parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature
you could use and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashion
they talk about history and guns and drugs and wars and all sorts of other history information
first off the business software on new computers are out of this world
overall the story had a happy mood to it showing love kindness and what a family should be like
strive to help them
if they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to 
the owner heard me
then there is email which can send letters photos and comments
secondly computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places
he could talk his friends into becoming what he is
should there be censorship in libraries
for thousands of years written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language
if libraries censored information then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased
this is the reason i believe the author ends the story the way they do
for example my library has three different kinds of library cards
computers always warn us about them
i have several reasons i feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some
there are a few minor instances where computers have hurt people but more instances where they have helped people
this can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in 
also when i was in fourth grade i had to do a project on 
and let me tell you there is no restarting after that
why do they do this
we have the technology why not use it
this an easy way to communicate or keep in touch you can learn from and you can have fun with the computer
so agree with me 
websites that are colorful and fun can teach kids how to multiply and read
on the other hand i can see why adults would want the books censored
the internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds
sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable other times it can be rather disturbing
there should be certain limits though
the cat is domestic per animal
every one has such a great attitudes
games make us disciplined in thinking and in actions
in the story the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist
about of collage students go online and do challenge
if we had no computers the lines would be even longer because then the people would have to add up the money by hand
mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools
i do not believe computers benefit society
me and my do not like that
you or not agree and we have others who do not care
if you took away a book or certain material off the shelf how could that help a child
but my favorite game is the hedgehog
this is what majority of the people in our society rely on
i believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad
really bothers me because when i was their age i had no idea what even was or meant
better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk
let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online
i would keep all items away from young children at all times if they are not good
censorship is not something to support
she is talking about the hibiscus and the geese
movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape
hopefully after reading this you will think the same i do about computers
after explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory
if you are riding and begin to run low on water your in trouble
music such as rap and the lyrics used in rap are whats making kids do stupid stuff the music talks about sex drug usage and murder
this shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert
there should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word or a few violent scenes for them to read
a study shows of families that go on vacations have strong relationships
while he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up
while your at it plant some flowers in your garden
if a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive so be it
exercising a very important thing for a healthy body and mind have a hard enough time finding time to do this
dear local newspaper i has come to my attention that many of us disagree on weather computers have a negative or positive effect on people
whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in online colleges are much rather cheap affordable to anyone
computers make our lives easier
censorship has been the topic of many debates involving politicians activists and the everyday citizen
in terms of race and religion everyone is considered equal but in terms of level of  everybody varies from one another
the doctors’ advice patients to take orange juices as a medicine
first off they can be dangerous
instead of sitting at the computer all people should be out getting exercise
my class room is in the second floor
a specific rating would warn viewers or readers from checking out an item that is offensive or inappropriate
also by saying which is still with me today and i am grateful
one theme was helpful
the heart of their home is the kitchen because they all love to cook
and the is suffering because of it
it is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed
events seemed pretty bad until the speaker became elated when they saw a factory
therefore i do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out
one time i was having trouble with fraction in math
as you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly
the subject race might come into play in some books in libraries
exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person
she sat down and looked up hundred schools
under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination
there are lots of stuff in book that people think is offensive
sites like this and many more are great when you need information
as you can see there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books music or movies
with books people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book
it would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live go buy it and read it anyway
when your on the computer you can even meet new friends and have conversations with them
she bought a plant that reminds her of home
also we could look at places we never saw before and if you want to get some where you can go the computer to do that
so when she goes to take the test it will be a year
dear  i have same questions for you and i was hoping you could answer them
that is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has
but i do suggest that everyone should have a computer they are helpful and fun
with books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young
it would be that simple just switch radio stations or pick up another book or watch a different movie
it just depends on the person and what they have grown up around or what they think is right or wrong
after going around the zoo we came out and sat under a tree
she promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted
hardly anyone will read them anyway
the desert setting with its lack of water shelter and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life
the serves many functions
aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing the computer holds many more wonders
it was where i learned the real definition of family
he past his hour playing outside
you can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer
the author creates a comforting mood because he talks about his home his family and what he grew up with
in the story it is said there was a sign that said rough road ahead
every student in my class used the computer in some way shape or form for their project
that is why i think the setting affected the cyclist
how does this pertain to offensive books
there is little water and it is boiling hot
in  we are a democracy but we still choose censorship to hide certain information from certain people
i think that books music movies and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries
as a student computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done
you can talk to your all
it would also be braking the law because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech
i will take that test again
they bought a that costs  on top of that they spent on all the programs they needed for the computer
i think people need to realize that computers are over the humans
the mood set in this home is friendly and inviting
computers can do many things like play game listen to music watch videos and chat with your friends
computers have helped us write essays more efficiently  complete research assignments
you should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer
i can understand why some people want to remove some movies or books from the libraries
four of us reached there three gents and one lady
but this all changes when he hit those horrible hills
is happy his parents moved to and is grateful of the sacrifices they had to make do do it
so i took my time and typed it out one letter at a time and it was correct
you can live your entire life indoors
dear editor i think that people are spending too much time on the computer
his route was deserted so nobody could help him
books movies or music about bullying should be taken out of
helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing
also it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends
they help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer
should books be censored
why censor things
they should write back convey their message and try to win support not control
these are some examples of the mood that was created
no matter if you have to start all over and doing it again
people can stay away from those areas that they find offensive
in conclusion the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change
so get off your butt and go outside
he showed in the passage the warmth and love in his home
bring down all that is bad
said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write talk or write back for much cheaper
all these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly
if i think that something is offensive then yes it should be removed from the bookshelves
you quickly tell her via computer you cant meet her
for instance had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books
technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life
for example when the cyclist notices nothing in sight his tone changes
some say there should be some do not
now many college students have the option of taking their lessons online
but at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family
things would be so much better
does censorship really help in our society
you can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some
spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels
dear  in my opinion i think we should use computers
in school they will hear verbal arguments and see fights
from three oclock till ten oclock playing chess with strangers from all over
my answer to that is no you should not
i know your probably thinking huh
of all people found out about their job on a computer
is so proud that his parents were so selfless and put everything on the line so that their future would be better
plus who would not want a good computer game once and a while
well not all magazines are rated  some have inappropriate material in them
either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used
each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner
people who stay on computers day waste precious time could be spent with family exercising or finding a true love
some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though
do you understand why computers are useful now
a second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket
many people dislike certain materials because of their content
in addition to computers let you book flights buy tax rates
while i was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing
no one told you that you had to read it
dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise
all this from spending time on the computer
like  and the obese have shown how people gain weight
they see pictures and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way way better than looking at a picture
some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside
such a lovely sound
first reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us
however hes still optimistic finally it funny that it was once a thriving little spot
shows his is gracious for what his parents did and how much they care about him
firstly computers are full of great advertisements
no one can blame the authors
if i had to write a paper on a person it would be almost impossible to do without looking up information about him on the internet
i rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them
i told you what i thought should go on in the library
not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well
the heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy
i believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored
the best part is that is free
people and life are now smarter quicker faster and easier
if they are in our libraries how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school
they all have a learning process
the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water
those are some valid points on why i believe that books magazines movies and etc
so go ahead and expand your knowledge
if you are doing a project on fashion a would be excellent to help them find out some tips
it seemed as though the worse his setting became the worst he personally felt
makes people stupid and makes you lazy
you find a book that is immature to you but you do not have to read it
but most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you
both great resources for talking with others
some might say that some material is offensive which sometimes it is
never will one book bind the world
there is a chance to move on there is hope
so please local newspaper keep reading and i will change your mind about computers effects on people
have had racial slurs in it but if one considers the time and place of the novel these slurs were normal for the time
most people who are and again
the author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home
we do not need any of this
this program lets students view the interesting way world cultures in videos
to them family was your community and friends

still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself
heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability
remember that they are very good places to go to for information to get books or just to go somewhere quite
also just communicating with friends
people are different and we have a right to our own opinions
those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality
it helps the cops catch the bad people
it makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge
the author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change
when kids get home from school they put their name work down and go right on the computer
these themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love
interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life
we have to stop this devastating pandemic
did you know that out of children today prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities
all of these obstacles tying into another
my parents turned off graphic or violent television when i walked in the room
i believe that censorship in libraries is wrong
over here he is saying that your friends can be your family or the people that you love
he keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on
there are plenty of books out there and many different authors that the person can choose from
davidjonathan etc
dear newspaper the years the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising and enjoying nature
this can range from exposure to certain movies music magazines books or to even commercials
she has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too
those people use the computer everyday but they use it correctly only for and they are just well are very smart and get good grades in school
parents are responsible for their children not only when it comes to providing food and shelter but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material
besides he has a trust map he got a lot from this trip
but because of the advances in technology running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted
that is why i thank that some stuff should be not on the shelves in stores
computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house
computers serve as a great source of communication
its ability to do such should not be compromised
you can meet people be search them up if you are trying to find a old friend
to make things better she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home
the large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers
these people are so smart they figured out a way to have school online
this is what i think should be done with this offensive materials
people like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know
therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive
one of my reasons are exercising
my third reason is when people do go on all they do is eat junk food and get no exercise
the memoir explains how proud the author was of their parents
a cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions
here instead of the songs of birds i heard the cries of hawkers and vehicles
violence is a main topic in newspaper articles
sometimes the cat spends hours and hours at the ratholes in searching of tats
when the hibiscus is  she will retake the test
he had to slowly maneuver around it though it was hard he was successful and continued down the road
then i will take the test again
first of all without computers many people would struggle
like go to the moon
maybe try looking at a a few pages of a book you once heard about
finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them
for one computers let people talk and socialize even if they are on different sides of the planet
you can look up certain workouts that you might want to do
this truth being stated censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone
there are so many good websites that you can go on like 
online you can learn about the history of specific places
think arguments are people find ability in talk online with other people and help with school work
censorship in libraries have you ever came across something in the library that makes you say  
obesity is a problem in 
young children should not be exposed to those things yet
furthermore be typing and reading at the same time we have trained or eyes to do many things similar to playing the piano
i think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material
one thing about movies that i like are they are good for visual aids
those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children
if something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed
i can think of at least three different sites that have online games
he had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water
some teachers burden the students with holiday homework
this could not of made his ride easier
in the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the apartment building was friends or even family
i asked him what he thought of his job
in conclusion social abilities are up with computers
should we have censored them
you can meet new people who can also give you good advice
in my opinion computers are helping  not hurting 
my brother wore a smart suit and a tie
did i ever get hurt
some websites are for specific games and same have many games on them
its faster than skimming through twenty books
you could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way
computers help people to make wrong choices and there is no doubt people should let up on the time they spend on the internet
out of students enjoy nature every week
well you can continue it on  or 
as the local newspaper  i am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town or even your own kids
i do not believe that anything that contains certain contents should be removed from the shelves
my family being immigrants from another country my family
there does not need to be any censorship in libraries
this is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry
teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word
an example of one such occurrence is in the short story winter hibiscus
to conclude debate on censorship plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship
kids forget to do homework to
the author describes the hardships his parents had to go through like adjusting to a colder climate in not getting good jobs
inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page
also it does not matter to me if i have to pay for the things that i check out from the library
sometimes life can feel so cruel
they are too busy with computers
this can work to people away from screens and the course
the words in songs can be offensive
the can help a student pass school
think of it in your own perspective
all they wanted me to listen to was christian music and i did not like that
to me i think computers are a positive effect on people
stop chatting pause your game take a break from your work and go outside
more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
you can learn about faraway places and monuments
no one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem giving a safe feeling
i barely talked to anyone unless it was through email
there are many ways communicate on the computer these days
by doing this he expects a better harvest
once she plans it things start to look up
you question a leading doctor
there is no point in taking books off the shelves
on the other hand they have no right to tell their neighbors what and what not their children can see
once again this is another reason i think offensive distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own area of the 
fresh air is good for you you
a holiday is free time and it should be spent in this spirit only
so the only person at full
in trying construct a monument the government and culture find that they have little to build off of
that is messing up the relationship with your family
many people find certain books music or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young reads
there were times of racism and violence
lastly you can use computer to find out about world news
until she got her hands on a computer
this shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over
family activities is a nice fun and enjoyable way to spend your time
first of all computers allow you to talk to others online
life would be very difficult without them
he keeps stating over and over that he is so grateful of his parents and family members
the ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story
because ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it
using computers people can gather data from others and create new inventions to help the world
in order for that person to ignore their personal issues they make fun of someone else
for the reason that anyone can be offended so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad
road accidents are a common feature of big cities
its just sun sand and him
my father took me to practice every day
if you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home
here is a quote from the text
dear paper name is and i am writing this letter on the count of the computer issue
it made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something
the hibiscus will be budding then a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting
if they do not like the item that they picked up they should take responsibility for their actions and not blame others for their mistakes
kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad
doing such the phone would be very expensive
sometimes we wait for him impatiently
she wanted to be back home
she decides that she was going to over comes its obstacles just as the flower over comes its obstacles every winter
the mood the author gave in the 
how is that fair
most people think computers are unsafe and that be partly true
yes all parents do not care about what their child reads so this could happen
that is why i think the computer has a great effect on people
into a computer to add beats and different vocals
in the everyday world people who break the law are put into jails and prisons
for instance have you ever wondered what the capital of is
so with her computer she can go to her favorite stores website and pick the clothes she wants
i believe that people should not be able to remove books movies magazines etc
lets you meet new people without having to tell them who you are
after six hours we reached kalka station
offending other people can lead to personal problems
in the story the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
on the internet you can even ask questions and they will probably be answered
it wont even phase anyone anymore
they just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts
i can see how it could be hard having to purchase these computers at prices as high as each
someone else say that what you find offensive is no where near offensive to them
in fact statistics recently released by the show that computers are the leading reason for obesity
another way is that you can get work done
theses materials are what keep people connected with each other
it is located at the other end of the library
you have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions
so there are just some things that contain violence that you just cant keep your child from seeing at one point in time
all we can do hope our children does turn on the radio that tuned into that crap and say  that sound like good music
they get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities
so by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain
i keep her in a big and beautiful basket
so till next time
second they would check and compare hotels in 
so i am here today to tell you all about them things
you can do this through via email
quicker to find out information
do you want to be overweight and not be in shape
my grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad and got so upset he cursed at the and almost threw the remote at it
you are always thinking about just that and no other things in life
the books someone decides to read is up to that particular reader
so basically its a waste of money
you can also learn all you need to know on computers
also the author discusses the unity and love between his family and neighbors
people are not getting enough exercise 
also your not exercising while on the computer being active keeps your shape along with being fun
just the other day i was in the library
the world is full of offensive things period
the heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive
lastly why is that everyone time i turn on the radio there is always a song that is not right for anyone to listen to
censorship is somewhat the same way
he seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water
i think that there are some people out there for example myself who like to watch movies and read books about slavery the holocaust etc
for one you might forget what you learned
the ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story
because it give me and my friends something to do after school
this was affecting the cyclist because he was tired hot and getting dehydrated
you can not go on camping trip
the answer is no
books are sorted by genre
and they are great for people with jobs
she was not happy at all i had no clue what she was doing
she want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories
they turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go
this terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated making his journey to all the more difficult
over the i had gone to my 
i got this feeling because his parents did hard jobs because they loved their kids
people make their own decisions and that is their right
possibly on the other side of the page you will see an ad for cigarettes
same concept with movies magazines music and etc
it to help you to learn how to learn without looking at the keyboard
in the progress the computer has put over of single people and expressing the relationship
we have them for breakfast in the form of cornflakes bread and cakes
she needs water to survive and the next town is very far away
without this valuable exercise more people are 
it could be offensive to some people but not all
yeah i get it that computers are very useful but they also kill your eyesight
we should therefore select and read good books only
now it is much easier because keywords are matched
when a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity
it helps us to know the results of our actions
because it will help everyone learned about new things
the author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents
why they wrote it that certain way
everyone loves him
my grandpa likes a lot of music because of their rhythm and beat
she is saying there is everybody has a certain opinion they take offense to different things
if you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf than what would the author who wrote the book think
the reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again
emotions like sadness hope and wounder
that candy could have been the guest favorite
also parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be over weight
or i can also talk to friends after a long day of school
people get addicted to the computer
while this be true for some people it is not true for 
this is especially true in this case because of his lack of water
i think that computers are very helpful
with computers we can online research save trees and communicate with people far away
  while growing up had poor influences all around him
overall computers are great but you have to know when and how long to use it
think about all the negative things that could happen
the culprits had taken to their heels when the lady raised the alarm
those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir
i know that there is always something that pulls you back in
and if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it
i do not believe books or any other form of art should be removed from the shelves of libraries
mostly good things by the way
as you can see technology these days is always getting more and more advanced
i remember several years ago i attended a and the party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released
the novel to a  is a great way for people to understand the history of the 
the cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive
people must be able to communicate as well people do not communicate with each other
when my grandma pm
generally this is not the case
i what that is like
people need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle and then apply that to their daily lives
many people like and have one
a second productive task can help us with is learning 
computers allow this
the friend who recommended the movie or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out
reading this makes me feel grateful to live in 
people do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on
the area he was biking through had barely any people
things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people
your in luck a computer teaches you
these were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people
when the people use the computer there are many choices that they have to make like what websites to go to and what to download or watch
keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch read or play
i think computer have shaped to what it is today
when she had a question she would have to ask somebody she know
having computer at home is not good specially to children
the materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them
she is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can
first libraries are a good source of information
the cyclist was exhausted as he was going up hill
why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer
they are there to provide all kinds of different information
for example moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it
before had his computer had to write out all his papers and when finished spent to long writing that could not do his rest of homework
some say that some technology like computers are bad i think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about for away places
that mood is happy and friendly
if a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch then go ahead and let them watch that material
i hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society
look at what computers can do
your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links containing information on that word to choose from
was founded on the basis of freedoms freedom of speech freedom of thought
give them what they want
computers are and best way to do a project
do you think computers are helpful
when the ears of rice are ripe they turn golden
some people take offense to them
i believe that children are the easiest people to influence
we can talk to friends online and we can learn about people from the past
you can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book
he had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth
you can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
should offensive material be censored
statement was from 
reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life
television news drama life and controversy
the tall trees silhouetted against the sky made a beautiful seens
plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing
using instant messenger is free
think about it
for example if the library only put out romance things then what would the action lovers do 
you can not hide things from them
dear newspaper editor you have a computer
the main reason why i am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends
it effect their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things
but when it comes to a nude magazine all about sex and being naked that should be in adult stores only
i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it
all the terrain changes not only changed the cyclists physical state but his mood and determination as well
friends will talk to each other endlessly through  but have no words for each other when they meet face to face
is both proud and thankful of his parents
he has to work under scorching sun and pouring rains
would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay
the springtime is a representation of a new beginning
when we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer
would you give them the right to keep it from you
however he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat
for people who find books movies music or magazines at the library offensive simply do not use them
first as the army keeps losing more and more soldiers in combat and they try to recruit people they can post their ad up over the internet
the coolies were moving about carrying luggage on their heads
if that happens smaller amounts of people will come
that effects the relationship with your family
even education is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge but in the long run does this really help people
then the conditions become hot dreadful and maybe sticky
the future setting of the paragraph spring symbolizes rebirth  another start from the cold hard winter
this makes the cyclist thirsty and tired
he arranges the letters in order
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time
if you read more you will see why i support these details
however once again it was very misleading
last reason would be children should not allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older
not saying that it is right but the library has done particular things such as separating the books for reasons like this
try something else such as an adult section
the story of is just one example of censorship
of the goes without physical domain for at least a and a half
he drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated
because writers do this makes a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate too
it is never intended to offend someone or bring bad to the world
to me it seems like when the hibiscus comes back to life
secondly people especially the younger generation spend excessive amounts of time on computers
some people say they are good for research and talking to people
this is one of our basic needs as an individual
they need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer
the internet has all the information in the world and people abuse 
one of my fathers friends had everything on his computer
he makes funny gestures and remarks
help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics
he did everything he could do to not losing his mind
picking a book or film to checkout from a library is a small choice but it is our choice to choose what we can handle
in this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways from bumpy roads ghost towns and trees
so he is proud of them
i strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people
especially when i had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in
dear local newspaper computers and other technology are the best thing that ever happened to the world
computers also help your imagination
people get offended all the time but do you see them trying to get what ever it is that made them fell like that
where you and your family would be to many dangers
the author creates different moods throughout the entire excerpt
in addition specially designed computers can tend to peoples specific needs
would you feel you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks
computers make school easier for students and teachers
you have to be over years of age
i feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries
the positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again
also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades doing so
three of those things are heat lack of water mud its anything town
in this book a young girl is raped very harshly
do you find the show the offensive
there are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas
writing out papers can be a hard tedious task
are they good or are they bad
face it everybody needs it
children are very curious
people in can talk with people in 
these books that a library holds are not only there to educate us but to entertain us as well
also certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who enjoy the book or movie
with a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets
my last reason is that computers help lower your stress level by playing games
it is cool and breezy
these books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader
though this is true it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it
it wrong to talk about them that way because it get teens to think it okay for them to do it and nothing bad is going to happen
one reason i think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project
i believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today
so as you can see computers have good effect on our society
experts are concerned that excessive computer use can harm your health hamper your social skills and cause you to be disconnected from nature
in my case my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad
dear local newspaper i feel that negative effects of computers on people is much greater than the positive effects
now say you came back and attack the problem again
it was a wonderful book
we should always respect them
she previously had a lot of home sickness missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood
they help function machines
the first thing that affected his ride was the heat
people have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country
so as a result computers are very helpful with homework and studying
or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught
i think what you should do its not get rid off computers
bye for now
people heard it and like followers they started taunting me too
he even maintains a sense of humor throughout writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men
in the end computers are great if used in regulation
the author concludes the story of paragraph with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl
the arrangement of their food is made by the warden
how will they accomplish that
computers can also help by talking to people
censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me
i think you should have to have permission from a parent or guardian if the material is explicit
this sentence not only makes the reader happy for him but they can see unity in his family
thus the old couple were saved from their valuables being stolen by burglars
well the answer is no
we must be very proud of our soldiers
the mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family
we are very thin because what we do almost every 
this indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today
teenagers that listen to music from or are getting bad messages
if we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read
computers also lead friendship torn apart
the cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured
taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture
that is all related to freedom of speech
even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in
also the computer has mainly improved methods of
a fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers
if you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone
in  children spent of their day in front of a computer and outside
there are all kinds of computers but they all do the same thing
he was freaking out
i went to the tea stall and had a cup of tea
man conquers by knowledge
it brings to the surface the evil side of human nature
i know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others
others think that they should be left up there for the people who want to read them to do so
magazines can also be educational
how did do with his idea he failed miserably
obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country
they can help with business interacting with family and friends and you could even just use for entertainment
i strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves
so why take away what they like
now the home has long list of regular patrons
it also means you can email that walk to a teacher or notes a friend who might have missed school that day
all you have to do is search your destination and pictures and info will come up so you can make the right choice
so they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to
they publish many advertisements
finally many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer
that of people use the computer to chart with people
in this book the population is forbidden from having any kind of book
it was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple
then you might be getting all the you need because your on the computer you might not go to to get the and veggies
if the parent does not want their child to go into a section then the parents can just say keep away from that area
would that not embarrass you
he ended up being an online predator
the sacrificed everything everything leaving their families friends and career
in conclusion this is how the mood creates the author
to get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden
dear editor the source  i have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers
i hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so every one can see how computers have a positive effect on people
for example these passages are set to copy down your number get your account number then take your money
my parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society
you can learn history about famous people places and events
i do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries
you as a parent should do your best to keep them away from those things you do not want them to see or hear
did you really spend your hard earned cash on a faulty hunk of trash
he is very helpful to all
remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex drugs and profanities
happiness was shown throughout the story
the author of the memoir creates a very loving peaceful and happy mood in the story
the cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building
not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive even if they be
for  i play music and talk to my friends at the same time
this things should be pulled
whether its playing games checking  or even working peoples valuable time is getting used up
think about all those people who have relationships and what not it off of computers really do help out
when a lot of people begin to protest that same material it has a high probability of being banned
in every book of every library their is something that people most likely think should be censored
another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture
the libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves
i know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me
if the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines then yes they can feel offensive about the things inside the magazine or books
if you ever miss a show to watched home of the show and watch it
the author adds this i mean not like the kind we had 
all of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that
the first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because their racist
when i see that i think  if a child saw this
books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines
computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers
the story tells about the girls transition into the different culture
the world is not a perfect place by no means
also it takes you away from what life has to offer
that we find offensive
if you go on the internet you can go and searching person or place and the computer will find it for you
and your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting 
a mason is an essential person in society
in fifth grade i had to do this really hard project
he wanted to reach there soon
she symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past
any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way
they have to cater to the individual tastes of the masses without regard to what other people find offensive
the computer has a lot to do with that
all you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong
we can see what happens on the other side of the world
later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path
remembers all the happy times he had and memories that took place in his home
using computers could possibly save your life one day
some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others but if read the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts

next couple of years from now people will want to get rid of something else then something else
the features affected is abilities because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle
many doubts about the computer exist but the computer can surpass all of them
if i was a parent i would be concerned myself
these can be hazardous and even deadly
in other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it
students stay in hostels and they study also
this goes for parents too
he had many visitors
i believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done
we can all learn so much from the computer and there are so many people who their jobs on computer
we needed it to thrive
you can research just about anything on everything because the computer will have it
without it they will have sloppy handwriting absolutely no chance at sports and much more
when he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated
no i know you will notbut think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think
we can find what is healthy to eat right away you can also get one of those fits for a computer
finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning
when the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil she will adjust and be ready to take the test again
plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home
i have notices many teens play cool games on the net
in fact i believe that doing so would create more problems for people
not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not
and that is how the author creates all the moods on the memoir
another example can be a book
if a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment then they might start taking away other rights
in conclusion is good for are society to have computers in are lives
the includes free speech which insures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters
it seems you cannot always make everyone happy
i am a fanatic of it
the way people want to take roll in the things they are part of might actually be found in the library
these types of things are very offensive to people
website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country
as you can clearly see computers are used all around the world for many different reasons
also this house has been this special to him by spending his childhood there and also how he got love from his parents in this house
censorship is just bad in general people should have the right to make their own decisions on what they want to read or watch
it is taking away the knowledge for our children
their motive to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location and to commit rape
the setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate causing him to sweat profusely and requiring like to drink more water
this is why
so instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library
communication over computers benefit now society can interact between one another
in the story he writes the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
think about it
this is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries
it was happier because we know that he could have more life opportunities in 
such as friends family and nature
they were going to take to a party
maybe go to the mall with friends and
today many jobs in due using a computer and technology is getting mom advanced
arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse
it makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy
movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film
i really hope that my opinions means something to you
first i think the weather conditions affect him
if your on the computer for hr
when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
raped in websites such as   and many other dangerous websites
almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today and because of that original and unoffensive material are hard to come by
people could act like someone else
he also encounters a terrain change from flat road to short rolling hills
the children buy icecream toys sweets and candies
dear  i believe that computers benefit society very much
kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves
in the memoir the author emphasized a very specific mood
here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike the baron landscape and relentless sun
therefore the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution
but sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter
there has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life
some of these things cause conflict
would you rather your kids to learn things from the facts or learn from friends
these books should be locked up so children cant get them
or some thing that fun or i think or beneficial to me
by removing the computer you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well
computer allow many people to become with each other in new and effective ways
certain materials in libraries should be removed
another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything
the first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there
he works for a  famous company and has to go to a meeting with the big boss is 
all in all there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests
if you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from
but those books about war are probably books about history
they also go to various island in the sea and engage themselves in many adventures
the setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally
the setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness
everyone the same rights and if the first offended person uses them to bring down then the right to do the exact same thing
but is that enough
i still am satisfied and so are they
so we decided to go to the zoo
parents need to protest so any thing they find offensive should get off of the shelve
in some cases the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent
some of the games are educational also
when you type your fingers are moving all around the keyboard creating hand muscles
that also shows she will not forget her old home
plus you are not being forced to something you  want to
well you cant online scans and some are free
such things can also show anger hate and depression
a teacher’s profession is a noble profession he is a nation builder
being on the for a while is not a waste of time
here are some of the examples that i can think of just off of the top of my head
however there are all different kinds of books music and all the other materials that could offend all different kinds of people
communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important
the television shows are still being aired
third communication are going to be a hole lot with computers
enjoying nature is another option
this shows the increase in effort in strain the terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure
nothing should be banned from a library music store or any other place that sells these materials
no one is perfect and we all make mistakes
the internet also keeps me closer to my brother whose in college because we can chat and send pictures to each other
most important person in our country
in the text is say it can make through the cold months
libraries are filled with books magazines music movies and many more materials
with we can talk to people around the world or in space that matter
so these are all my reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people
they need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up
they suffer and their oppressors enjoy
if you take away those books then you will be harming our societies ability to learn
this winter hibiscus
fairs and festivals are held in every town and village of india
during the whole memoir the designer is happy
people are also losing the ability to interact
the playground gets crowded and there is hardly any game possible
observing others when in offensive situations help find a solution to these problems
many things the founding fathers of the did were considered offensive but that did not make them wrong and it made the a better place 
magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across
i think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone
this was a horrible action because the religion is an extremely interesting one and now many people will never know anything about it
starting their lives over again and taking any job they could find
mainly children use the library more than any other age
no matter what your interested in freedom was gave to you so use it
some and just other races get offended by these types of things
of people by the computer people spend and friends
it depends on the person
should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
so go got your camera and go some where with wild life and have fun
she vows that in the spring when the hibiscus is budding restarting its growth cycle she will restart too and retake the test
this affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated
the staff of the post office works day in and day out
his main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat
the computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know
in conclusion i believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful
both me and think that this is affecting people in many different ways
do you really want to act that way to your family
secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world
in conclusion censorship is a concept that has its place in society but must be used very carefully
as one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together
for example the heat is constantly drying the biker out
the internet is very addictive
should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive
i think that there are are books movies and other media materials that can be found offensive to someone or a group of people
can kill you
they could try suicide
i hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts
kids should be exercising outside not siting at home on the computer
it also works well for giving your children a memory they will always remember
it is either to keep them safe pure or happy
we need to turn the computers bring out the board games and keep families together
text books are there to nurture value among the young minds
they have censored movies just sitting there
it is faster and more accurate
as you can see on even a less global level of use the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users
computers can be very helpful to many people
different websites with tons of information and true facts really affect grades of most students
out of have said they are their are spending to each time on the computer
she is somewhat hard of hearing
the reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it
new programs such as word have a special function called voice commands
its fast easy and safe
if someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others
all types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries
you will parish
the cyclist faced some problems while on the journey
so there is no reason for it to be taken off
ratings worked with television and movies so why can they not work for books to
next thing you know you have a or on an assignment that the thought you aced
there are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day
the features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist
people spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends
the sun and hot air dehydrated him faster
the fact that there was nothing around him made the author lose hope and trust
censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society
these websites that gives the ability to talk with friends and play games have made lazy and addicted to the computer
but the is happy
in india people are very careless about punctuality
parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea
however we can prevent it
in saying this it can go either way
he was going through the desert so it was like degrees
this means there was no water available for him
the first thing is that the mood is love
this website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on
but at the same time if he had asked someone else for directions he would not have been in this situation in the first place
well this pattern has been going on for years
i think this because people use it to research stay in touch with friends and family and music
 a concerned parent at 
computers are only the start of it all
my first reason why we should use computers is because it gives us information like the weather reports school openings delays and closings
just picture it two girls is mad at herself and at the world and hates a tape about angles
no good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries
their loyalty to the party is greater than sense of fair play
if you have a job for working with computers or fixing computers then you would spend a lot of time on your computer
now it is our rite to save our books if we do not then us as will be lost
last one not story this lets the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well
if things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section
now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to
life is to short to worry and feel offended
in conclusion the reason why people should not spend their life on computer because they think they will be entertain by technology instead of interacting will their family
music is probably the hardest to figure out of these censored things i have spoken of today
having a computer is a huge benefit to society
we go to the church to offer prayers and enjoy singing christmas carols
i just gave you some reasons why i would say that
the second reason why i support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online
imagine talking to your friends not having an with his ever leaving your room
censoring or removing things that you find offensive be a good idea
on the computer there are many settings
therefore i say the mood of the author in this memoir is happy grateful
that right in the quote that is feeling grateful
i believe censorship is a great thing for youth
during his fights he kills the creatures that he fights
country music for example is very peaceful to me
i believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like
he might learn tips from the magazine or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful
this is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader
one card is just to check out regular books
they love all their friends and family and celebrate with then no matter what
people are simple love each other and enjoy life like one big family
also everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world
another thing that has been a problem is magazines
are good and bad no longer matters of opinion for the readers themselves
he just explained how he was very thankful for how his parents raised him and the lessons that his parents taught him
besides most music and books are meant to entertain not offend
a computer is a very helpful resource
they seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across  but is it really true
the computers we use in society do not harm us in any way
the computer could teach babies how to talk
then seconds the computer said you have a virus
computers make you unhealthy bullying takes place on the computer and it effects how you do in school
so  as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression
for example many parents do not want their children reading listening or watching certain things
he would never take the advice of anyone but his map again
back in my military days nothing helped better than talking
no one would know what an author would be leading too not a single artist could display their art
certain materials that are found in libraries are sometimes not age appropriate or even offensive to other people
another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down
its a library a place where people go to get information
some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal but what is normal
so readers of the 
but what if i told you that any person could put anything on the internet
computers effect us in a very good way and they change our every day lives children these days cannot type
you can make what that person stand for meaning nothing at all
taking music in my opinion would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music
all of these thing are the definition of family
they can be used as a valuable learning tool help communication and teach skills that will be used for life
moving along i want to talk about how you can get information in a instant with computers
there will always be that one person who declines to agree
believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books
you can also meet new people from different countries and become their
camels are ruminants but camels do not chew their food very well before swallowing
he is also admiring the things they went through such as leaving behind their families and careers in the country they loved
the road that author was ridding it was rough
these symbols are important to her in that they give her a chance to start over and she sees that in the winter hibiscus
teens have computer every week
being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death
if i miss something on  it is almost definitely going to be on the computer
for rated movies they can have them in the library
there have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking
a library is a place to go relax and read
some people prefer rated movies or music with explicit content
all of the computers were filled with people and a line with people ready to go on next
some stories are there for our entertainment some catch our emotions and some our there for our knowledge
however there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus
experts say that people are starting to spend to much time on the computer and less time in the real world
i had slight headache
in addition computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family
censorship of libraries would take away our rights
a good example of this is the popular internet video site 
what do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer
the setting affected the cyclist in many ways one way was the weather
however because one cannot effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects this is a difficult statement to make
how do you take it when people come out with magazines movies or music that is extremely offensive to you
mr suresh ahluwalia is the librarian
this shows that he is grateful for what he received and the mood is very joyful
these are some examples of how the describes the mood
i want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry
to make his life better
there are websites that help you find people
interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away
computers let us keep in touch with others
when kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing
i believe that computers can ruin your life and make you go blind
he is being introduces to crude language sexual behavior and criminal acts in the minute time period it takes to listen to the full song
it was free and welcoming
this would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents
you lose a lot of friendships like this
these are the features that affected the cyclist
he relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months
it shows her liking her new life for a few reasons
censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion
we helped him to come out of the car
life possibly become rather boring
people sue messaging to connect with their friends family  other people they not know
but first i want to be educated on where i go
a social life is very important to a grater
well i disagree with this statement
dear  i am on the side of computers
buying and selling things on the computer is easier than it looks
when it is turned away it is the night time
a lot of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people
libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups
the censorship that i am discussing is specifically about censorship in libraries
normally the would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly
on the seventh day i could ride the bicycle all by myself
this world uses computers for the wrong reasons
there are many things we can do to stop our children from watching listening and learning about these negative things in life
his family supported him by growing up in a happy loving home
surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section
this obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast
dear local i hear you are not sure if computers are good or not well they are and i have many reasons why but i will tell you is
computers have helped make that easier
these settings were hard on the cyclist
dear  in the the world has changed so much for the better
he braved the elements and forced himself on with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him
what i do think is that they should keep everything in the library
also this ties in with something our country was founded on which is freedom of the speech and the press
when i listened to music or watched movies i got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger
it has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music movies magazines and other forms of media
also parents you computers for work or maybe to get away from work to take a vacation they need took book it some how
his ride ended up being even harder than it would have been
censorship solves no problems but it makes everyone unhappy
also what sets the tone is how talks about loving his parents and how is grateful for them
if people avoid their computers then we could be one of the fittest countries
some people say computers are not distracting well i say they are
for this reason these offensive materials should be removed from libraries
three out four adults who used computers say that they help them with their work and social status
make the change today
parents need to watch what there kids read and watch on a daily basis
the mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic
when on the computer kids will eat
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes
this website is even more dangerous then or 
the computer was a great invention and it is benefited mankind as we speak and that it is that hard to set up
parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials
not any more
i would have very friendly relations with all the teachers
with this in mind i should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog
without a computer how would teachers get mail sent to them without wasting paper
first of all the libraries will lose customers
secondly computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with real people
but shell be more prepared
she sees a familiar plant and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up 
the features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot
what the country finds however is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies
and it can help us find things like job and other stuff
they help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about
it would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools
i believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library
is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves
statement is as true as any statement could be
another is that it lets people stay in touch with family and friends around the globe
for those people who love sports you can look up you favorite team and see if they won that weeks game
lastly he thanks his parents a lot
however we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror
the world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions
music could also be a bad influence on kids
it will not give you a job or school education
also it helps people talk to people from different countries
books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner
we just have to raise them the best we can
after two hours we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant peanut shade
there are times when a soldier gets wounded or may even die
parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries
trees play an important role in purifying the air around us
an orange is round
for example   and yahoo
however some people can take what the says to be offensive in regards to homosexuals and divorces
finally you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to
my mother and i worked out a compromise that i could read novels that she approved of
is this the right thing to do
first the cyclist noticed a rode change from flat to short rolling hills
you would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again
when she says in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are
decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was aloud to practice their right to speak freely the idea of censorship was not in the plan
that is what the narrator choose to end the story that way
but no one really makes a huge thing out of it
they split the white sunlight into its basic colours
most people use some kind of computer to talk chat and text
a picture on a computer cannot even compare to what it is really like
the mood the author created is very grateful
he is always saying how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to to create a better life for him
music is a great thing that all age groups love
one reason be to explain how she has changed in the story
now with the internet i can able to talk again
then probably on his merry way to his destination
computers are bad for most people
perhaps radios and libraries can be even further examined
lastly computers make people spend less and less time with their family and treat their computer as if the computers are 
wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb and the growing realization that i could drop from 
also obesity numbers have increased greatly since the invention of personal computer and the internet
the memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad
his cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in 
i will also explain how the past has an effect on present day
just as remembering the has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes keeping books of the most horrible content save authors from repeating such dishonorable content
local library closes at pm
almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features
we all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainments
i knew that when i was old enough to read those novels they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me
i want the libraries to think this over  because it is not fair to adults or older children
when i asked what movie she was looking at she turned the cover over with no reservation and said 
surf you cant online
lastly using computers will open a gateway communication    etc are a few of the many ways to communicate online
normally they would miss their homework
if you need info
that shows the fall of man
these seem to be the kinds of books that young children have become interested in
so do yourself a favor get off the computer and go visit some really great people
so i think talk online or using the computer is important
if i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back
and you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive
others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression
the atmosphere is more disciplined in a hostel than it is at home
because of computers talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away
the hibiscus also reminds her of her home
finally computers allow people to talk online with other people
we want to keep your children away from the bad things
because of the excessive heat he needed more water which shortly became the conflict of this story
i believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials
first off computers give us the ability to talk with people all over the world
books can be used for many things
books being taken off the shelves
it should be protected from water
people are spending to much time on them not enjoying the outdoors and are taking away time to spend with friends and family
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit
i believe that the book that none of us read
one of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde i have ever met
what are you waiting for
dear local newspaper you know that over half our nation own home computers
is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material
this shows us teenager to think like our lives depended on it
as a long distance running i know what the sun will do to you during a hot day
not traveling outdoors deprives our body an important 
they always had there door open for friend and family and most of there friend would go over every night
today libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials
in the essay each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy delightful unique
people would take their business elsewhere
less time on computers would also time outdoors
lastly i think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers
they can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing
in my opinion i think that computers help people out a lot such as looking up directions or even chatting with some old friends
this is what the final paragraph in the story winter hibiscus means
there were scenes involving women that i did not understand and many new words
you can talk to people from other places
a world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions but hundreds of years of war love and hate
music that is bad should be taken off the shelf
everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there
these actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane
now you know what computers are doing to the people of the 
computers is a great tool to use while you are doing your homework
the mood created by the author in a memoir
it is very easy
it is needed has many advantages
the library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material so that people nor children have to see them
everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not
i agree we should spend more time outside but we should also spend some time inside
allow the adults to censor what should be censored in their families
newspapers give us information about our country
it is all a matter of opinion
in the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school
in some cases morality might not be the issue at all
is that truly what people are doing at the libraries now or are people there to look at vulgar books magazines and movies
a similar thing to this is instant messaging
to sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends
just like books and magazines every one has their own taste in music
computer are a of looking in many different take days
than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing
thank you and have a great day
there is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives
the author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement
in that case parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library
also some of these topics could be used for educational purposes
they could have never used one before but then they learned how easy it was
most of these books resulting to violence
see now i have a since of humor
in paragraph he describes his home growing up in great that makes it feel almost like you are there
from what a word means to the directions to get to  the computer can help with all of this
you might say that it is good for me but it is not good for you
today there are many books that teach or give a bad message
they are now a important and useful part of jobs people have now
should materials in libraries be censored
dear  computers are helpful once in a while but out of people believe that they are a waste of electricity
during those times people did call by explicit names even those who were in no way prejudice
during the day they will be very tired in school or work and the internet will be the one to blame
she believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding that cannot pass the test until it is
the features of the setting in this story do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist in a huge way
also the computer is bad for people because they will be on the internet all night and get no sleep
computers are helping society become more and more lazy
if its finally out and people have the chance to buy it they hope it will stay available
we use it everyday during sports taking notes even playing video games
only fun and energized people get out and get active
however some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them
how did he make himself glorious among all other creations
some enjoy things that others not
most young adults read about books that are about adventure mystery or love
but of this will happen if you stay on your computer 
like the geese
finally freedom
ho this quote shows that even though she failed she is determined to pass the test and succeed
said  a science teacher at 
his children are good natured and have good manners
people like joking around with others
the author this mood with his quotes that puts in
no matter what there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is whether it be a book or a song or a movie
this made him despair
you can break this paragraph down to mean many different things
like i said everyone is different
the biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired
but do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them
i have read it and was not offended
dear local newspaper would a person do with out a computer
some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons
