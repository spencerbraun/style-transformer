many people had come there for a picnic
i will now like to elaborate my reasons further
you can run a business from your very own living room
family planning should be adopted to control the birth of children
yet the real question is about our children
i understand that some teenagers can be offended to drugs or killings in magazines or books but some people like reading about that kind of stuff

dear officials at the have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives
the problem is that because of people are now more addicted to entertainment
so i think computers are a great machine for people to have
now a days people literally worship the computer like it is a
my first reason is computers can be used for research
a policeman performs very hard duty
this shows he will work hard and is in need of water
the libraries should have labels on every section to let people know what type of material it is

everything was censored
it is a pointless task to do

of equipment coupled to the computer would help us to operate audio and video
also certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who enjoy the book or movie
how many times has it been said that communication is key to a healthy relationship
clearly and his family were very friendly and did many things that were peaceful
most importantly you can talk to friends
distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch

another reason computers could lower your quality of life

mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is for quick access to them
libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs
i have to input that i personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours past
if there are materials that adults do not want their children to see they not be comfortable having their child there
studies show that people find the internet easy to use and quicker than any method
you cannot censor any books movies music or magazines
it seems to me that people need different activities to get them off the computers
now i only see them about twice a year it is so quiet without them especially at my house
if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned
because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect everyone must be heard
people might come in the library looking for a book that they want
the hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated
they are things we must learn about so we do not repeat them
that is mostly always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you

he could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street
in conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope

you never have that issue with computers
there is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf

looking and finding things you never learned about even if it offends others
it shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one after seeing the flower from her childhood memory
however some books not be entirely appropriate to certain people
last example is if you want to learn about your countries history and the leaders behind it then you would use the computer

the hot weather was another factor that affected the author trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state

getting more exercise could help you out in a big way because the less exercise you get means the less healthier you are
the choice is yours which side are you on
so i am going to tell what i think over this subject
that shows the caring thoughtful tone the author had as he remembered fondly about his past
she failed the grade
censorship is a matter of great contention today
dear computers are a great invention
this is important to because i am not very well organized when it comes to school

no i do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves
so get up grab the kids and get going on your new and energized pain free life
of are already obese so why keep these horrid games out there
they both could have good ideas and functions to them
the library had historical movies but i ended up watching that by myself
it also says that they learned the real definition of family
i can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors
some say they are helpful to society and others say not
although after approaching the old factory he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded
computers informed many people about them
so you can and you will get a good grade
florence nightingale introduced the famous “nightingale oath”
that is what i believe in
you can meet new people who can also give you good advice
the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason
then they would get in trouble
censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world
i think they should all be blocked and out of children reach
teens who are going to be immature about it does not deserve to have all those things
his lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things
movies music and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths

furthermore computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch
kids and teens would be so bored that they would the parents insane
not all magazine have something that can be use to educate
i do agree that books music movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves
there are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display
no form of life exists on it due to unfavorable conditions
coming to it in many shapes and forms
for one his body heat raised a good bit
r is for restricted to people under seventeen without an adult present is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult
his head struck against the ground
step out of your door and you are faced with indiscipline
people to for freedom over much bigger issues than books

time is the most valuable possession of a man in a civilized society

what do you want your child being exposed to
he prepares his lessons
however because of this invention computers have allowed us to do incredible things
i was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others
more than of give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them
just think you sitting in the house on a rainy day bored out you mind and have no thing to do
just think of all of the things we rely on this device to do
every day in the morning i clean and oil it
i was so happy that i gave my brother a tight hug
the author describes the many things her parents have given to her
now there seemed a little chance for it’s a follower to catch up
that is about all i have to say on the topic
explicit or eighteen or older books movies magazines or music be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library
people use the computer for school work
a movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog
well it does in fact when you type
so they try to get them out of the library
others see it as freedom of speech and writing
who can judge whether something is offensive
in this passage is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family
one could see why computers are bad but they benefit a lot of people everyday
below i will explain each reason
if you missed the best part of a you could easily go on a computer look it up and importance of computers in every day society
for students in any grade level and any class research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher
passing on the information can become a conflict and people certainly do no want that
computers are one of the most used tools on the planet
people have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic
something has to be done about this
that is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf
it keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school
for some it just depends on your age your beliefs and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place
third reason that it give people the ability to learn
so we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger
do you want students all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most
the conditions for the cyclist in the story do not exceed posted speed limit are pretty dangerous
the library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back
they are used by just about everybody
a strong nation is being built with well disciplined society performing its duty efficiently at all levels
you can talk to people from far away by using chat or the webcam
no one likes to be told what they can and can not do
it seemed as though the worse his setting became the worst he personally felt
just recently there was an earthquake in and million of civilians died
it can also show us the lives about people from the past
just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers their ability to display the most current information
those are my reasons on why it should not matter weather we have those types of materials in the library
studies have shown that of people that use computers have an increased hand eye when doing activities like sports or games
very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other
some adult come into the library looking for one of these books so then they can ask and find them
many people need time to think about what is happening in their life and they cannot do this our internet
if we say stuff right out of the offensive book we would get in severe trouble
this also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test
here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood his gratefulness and his view on things
a instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
this is not the truth and it should not be in our libraries
same with the magazines movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library
use the for an hour a time and take rests before using it again
literature in every form a great way of learning
my first point is that you can get a better education using them
all these reasons and more are why i believe that computers benefit our society
being off the computer feels better and is better
of the people in the say that a computer has many people think that from a computer
sometimes life can feel so cruel
there are so many uses
one you can use them to get information for a project talk to your friends or learn about something you have never known before
the rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i remember one morning when i was rushing before school i had no idea what type of outfit to wear
this statement might affect the cyclist in the way that they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out
other people might enjoy that book
it shows how happy he is that he can live in and lead his own life
by doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person
i personally think as a person who attends the library often that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways
no one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology
the computer makes you better at this
when you are on the computer
not just one genre a person wants
the cyclist was pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along
most of what i would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people
by having the hibiscus plant with her it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one
so in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation
plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home
the population of india has increased at an alarming rate after independence
it is his pride that makes the readers feel happy for him
lastly and maybe even most importantly computers are on enormous source of knowledge
there would be more to do
another thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your home town
computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know
when the ball goes right out of the parts
in paragraphs five six and seven expresses his gratitude towards his parents and how much they had to sacrifice
today so many people think of censorship as a bad word
after all the freedom of speech is written in our rights
language helps to set the time period in the novels
i believe books magazines movies music etc
is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries
he sees a building up ahead and discovers that its a walrus grape juice factory
it also helps you to look things up like people states and etc
because moving was a very hard for her
both these books are popular even today
so why would anybody take books off the shelf for being offensive
the author created a joyful mood
in addition if a student forgets losses or is missing homework they can log on the school website and print the paper out
i know what i am allowed and not allowed to read
the point is is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library
they placed the offerings of sweets in front of the goddess
why kids are acting the way they are
there are books out there that describe in detail sexual scenes and many parents do not want their kids to read these kinds of books
it s twice as hot during the summer
person in or most of the games are safe and fun to play
if there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested
there is no need for an angry public or strikes
the only on that this has happened to out of people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this
the setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next miles easily
at ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration
in the memoir it creates a peaceful mood
the peahen is not for beautiful and her feathers are brown
that younger people should not be subjected to but as and adult you should be able to readwatchand hear whatever you want
he became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water
dear i think some people are overreacting its not really going to kill you
more family time can be but i think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising
i was babysitting her one night while her parents were at the movies
all the facts are true ans i say about people in the world go threw computers every year think hard
now on to more about how computer are good to society
a girl climbed up the ladder without any support
you can go online and find everyone in ten minutes
what do you think about them taking books music movies and magazines that are offensive
dear computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike it
such as rated movies that contain things like drug use sexual content and extreme violence
with the way things are today its almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence
the author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored
bulling happens to out of every kids
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better
it appears when raindrops act as prisms
also his lack of water was a problem to begin with
they watch inappropriate videos or pictures
kids not know what is bad from good but you still have teenagers
computers play many roles and being used for fun is one
just do something that involves being outside is so much fun
someone enjoy a piece of work another finds offensive
do you believe that certain materials such as books musicmovies magazines should be removed off of the shelves if they are offensive
you need them to see how you are doing financially computers are essential to our and economy
we cannot really do anything about this
why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves just out of reach of the children
freedom to chose is something every person can have such as what type of clothes you wear
many people think email is a waste of time but can help you in your everyday life
is it quiet peace or calm
in conclusion i was asked to write a paper to you seeing if i would like to keep computers or not
computers have been so helpful for many people with this same problem
this makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth
it just depends on how you feel about what has been written
the titles of the books are displayed on boards
you spend less time exercising interacting with family and friend and the impact that computers can do to lives in the future
sports teach is to accept both defeat and victory in the same spirit
for an example who is harry
they girls end up being underweight sick and maybe do drugs
the author found a bait shop and got water
censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long
please take my reasons into consideration
have you ever had this problem
now people of all ages can use it for all different kinds of things
when you get bored what do you do
she has set a goal to accept it
the cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water
if its finally out and people have the chance to buy it they hope it will stay available
computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information you can socialize and you can improve your skills
so the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous
music is the number one entertainment people enjoy
the last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family
they actually can be quite good for people
i have to disagree though
line in paragraph the author explains how grateful he is to his parents which showed him the lessons which became the root of his life
it is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone
books are sorted according to what appeals to what age
there should also be an extra bonus at the festival time duty
for example at dinner you can get a great recipe off the internet
the time is now to step up to the plate librarians
to conclude computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone
if they do not like the item that they picked up they should take responsibility for their actions and not blame others for their mistakes
also most talkative skills will help kids today with there confidence
the had to make room for other books
i believe computers are good thing but only if they are used properly
its the most common thing to go on the
they should censor what their children do
the computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while
the reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument as people lived happily without controversial books
it should not be censored
books are another thing that could use some censorship
you have the right to ask what certain music books or movies are like and movies have ratings on the case
some of us carried fruits some carried cakes and some carried snacks
the third thing is movies
however at the period of time the book was written these words were not considered to be wrong
other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer
i truly feel bad for that person then again it could be fixed
nowadays people just give out information to random people
since everyone is different the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see as perfectly fine to watch or
that was really hard
they also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often
finally freedom of speech is why they should say
you have to be careful where you go when using the internet
i feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off
many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn
others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer and not exercising
i think computers are great effects on people they help out a lot
it could be twice a year or more a month or whatever is picked as long as there is one day or even more than can exercise on
thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips
a lot of people these days study from the internet i know i sure do
his parents were kind giving and generous to everyone
playing sports can also help you get stronger
it could be online chatting and even sharing photos
kids are living through computers and we can change them
in libraries there are a bunch of books music movies magazines and etc
of all teenagers like watching music videos
with that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding
during this decade many sports games have come out for the computer
but not everyone agrees that this benefit society
and also the home bringing the family closer together
it is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them
there are two books that i read called the and
people depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know
after reading this information and the descriptions
on the computer you can chat with people everywhere
the authors have the right of freedom of speech but it can go the other way around too
since the story takes place in the desert the temperature is very hot
typing is a quick and fairly simple way to write that saves people valuable time
one specific type of person does not go to the library
when a person listens to music or reads a book that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be
then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride the roads went from flat sheet to short rolling hills
instead of calling them up or sending them an email you could chat with them and still see them in the flesh
should be removed from the shelves if found offensive
the books are ranked critiqued summarized back cover summary and even sorted in a library
by her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom
let people make there own decisions
i am a science student but unlike my other classmates i have opted for elective english
that is my opinion on books movies magazines etc in our libraries
if a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf
i am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody
this farm of online communication was perfectly safe
this is because these games are so absorbing
this way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material
i remember the times when i had a project due at school and i guessed on
many kids do not do any type of athletic sport
every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person
just to add to the misfortune of the story
many people believe computers are bad but how can you make friends if you can never talk to them
especially in the you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park
and just when you think you find something everyone likes someone will come along and disturb the peace
so now hes riding and angry that he took their tips
more people need to interact with friends instead of going on their computer
i know the answer to that question
by reading this memoir one almost feels like they are at his house surrounded by his friends and family
i think that computers are great
with your address they can even look at your house on a website or possibly get your houses blueprints
when the cyclist is at his low point he is an abandoned ghost town looking for water that tastes like battery acid
censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn
lastly you are able to find lots of information quickly and easily
thank for reading about how we need to mange our time issues how we use the computer and computer dead
some computers even have built in cameras that lets you hold conversations with peers through the computer while seeing each other
these are great steps to achieving a positive step to public influence
when we visit libraries we expect to find the information that we came there looking for
failing hurt her greatly
if there were no computers i would have to use a typewriter and if i made a mistake i would have to type the whole thing again
one thing is the water
he is one of the brightest students of our school
go and talk to them in real life
my hobby is gardening
why wait another minute
computers are very great to have around
this reminds me of my friend named
being a student i am commonly curious about what references teachers are making and additional information that is not provided
you can research faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe
today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials
file save is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place
when the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope
the mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful
computers greatly reduce that hassle
about of all picture on the internet are true
more importantly how many different races are there here in or even all around the world
computers help other people learn about far away places
computers are and best way to do a project
this is just an example of unneeded information and skills that keeps people wanting to go back on the computer
final reason i can do a lot of things like find a question or do project on
first the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public
i know people who are addicted on because they get addicted to talking to people and looking at other people
many people have papers and of important information and it could be lost in a blink of an eye
florence worked day and night and put everything right within a few weeks
children are curious little beings
there are so many things that little kids can see
the new technology is helping people interact over the
until the final paragraph the tone in the story is depressing
i am years old and i go to a in called
my reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones
the computer can make things visual to kids and out
the answer is that they can
these are features that had an affect on the cyclist
a ringmaster came with a lion
they are helpful for getting your local weather
now we could be talking about at the very least
the next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride he had to do and that made him disappointed
in this modernized world computers are key
dear local newspaper are so many people that addicted to computers
computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl
companies use computers for easy access to the public
and without a computer all that would be very challenging
the policeman uses force if there is a danger to the lives of citizens
there are many ways to tell
she is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in
it also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world
libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could think of
he takes a little rest and starts work again
computers should be for everyone
your children will see it if they truly want to
well i personally do not go to a library but many others do
thank you for your time
you get your information from books and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time to get to a local library
dear people think that computers are used too much and are helping people become over weight and even obese
the mood of the essay i think is a sort of dry summer day the sort of oh my gosh its really hot type thing
to me that sounds like something with a positive effect would you say
the internet is great also because with the internet you can learn of foreign nations
with my wings i can fly above all the buildings in the city
at a young age i selected a book i had thought was a ghost story
even most they are not physically with you talk to
in this memoir there is more than one mood
this can range from exposure to certain movies music magazines books or to even commercials
lastly having computer skills is very very very important in the real world
the snake charmers and jugglers were also there
there are quite are quite a few who take to begging because of it
if you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store
because of computers people have lacked exercise missed enjoying nature and other parts of the world and forgotten about interacting with family and friends
but are they getting used to much
when she completes and past her test she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day
she ends it with that statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus
besides he has a trust map he got a lot from this trip
when a person is typing they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters
it provides information on vacations hotels ext
in my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed
people ask much should be censored
in conclusion i state no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library
i think its happy that he can express his feelings to us the reader
should people have the right to take down other people ideas
in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
clearly the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives
they are not so tasty and palatable as mangoes in our country
you cant always censor that
the computer can also be very dangerous
so whenever you go in there your parent are with you
the computer has a lot to do with that
once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would take your mind off of thirst
finally there is no water around
a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you with mixed emotions
even now they have somethings where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer
these days it is very popular
the mood the author created is very grateful
dear newspaper you agree that people could use computers all the time and never get off
anyone can learn important things
let me tell you some important facts about the computer
of have a computer at home
can only learn so much from a world history textbook
she bought a plant that reminds her of home
in one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down
what would become of an army without discipline
however censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately
she wanted to be back home
the cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water
one way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water
spring season is the best time for doing any work
if we made the change the age limited on movie we might be even better off
this can help make new friends or make friendships closer and cause less problems
imagine how angry the parents of the child would be
dear the people have been saying that computers are not beneficial but they are wrong
i would give my students the real education
there are mysteries romances comics biographies and anything else that you be able to think of
music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves
if literature keeps being censored there will be none left for future generations to enjoy
if you want to know why computers are useful just keep on reading
should that be the new normal
burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind
they are showing the violence that people only have in their head
without ever leaving their state
can literature which is the basis of civilization be censored
that is how computers are good
as technology to affect our lives we used to remember that being healthy is more important than sitting on a computer all day
there will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine
dear newspaper i think computers are a good effect in our lives
also in the author talks about how he could not thank his parents enough for all they have done for him
the reason why i chose those things is because you can look those things up on
i can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time but so would a book
it teaches at least it taught me that if you can dream something then you can do it
censorship in libraries
dear local newspaper
its been proven that computers cause memory loss
it was extremely not out in the setting he was in
the lyrics and sounds speak to many people in strange ways
republic day and independence day function at national and regional levels are also shown on television
we will not learn the new ideas that authors put out there for us if people just keep getting offended and taking them off the shelves
who knows what computers will be like years from now
i literally knew nothing about them and i failed to bring home my book
it shows new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it
so leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose
but my favorite game is the hedgehog
a major debate of today would be that of the media
these are all things you would not like your children to use see or do
there are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to
there on like for eight hours
if you can use your eyes and your hands at a you can hit a baseball or even
another thing is that you could actually need your computer to stay
sometimes he goes to the chapel or the village square to discuss the village matters
have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your ever day life
i have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended
it is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last
also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes
the place was crowded
without computers we would probably be really bored for the rest of our lives
instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game
thank you for your concern
the computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics
he has trouble finding a place to get water
those were the opinions i had on computers
the sheer delight of movement is enough to make the day
i think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness
not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome
computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free
one can sit on the rod ahead of the seat and the other on the seat
we all love him a lot
after failing her drivers test walking into the florists shop and finding that plant comforted her
that was proven in a say a by head of human reactions
we not even be able to communicate with some others
you can also meet new people from different countries and become their
having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression
but i saw in the afternoon that only my father was coming jump to home
do you believe this is the message to be school to future generations
goat milk is expensive
computers are very convenient
without knowing how to type you not get any top class jobs
should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the selves
the snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year
a person who is doing sports generally developed special qualities such as patience courage and senesce of responsibility
he leads a simple life
computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more
the answer to this big question is no
most people check out books or movies that they have heard about so for the most part they know what they are reading be offensive
dear local newspaper spending too much time on the computer is never a good thing
that was what i thought about when i was tempted to actually remove them
an article is made to show the pros or computers more people will experience the wonders of them
it all happened in no time
the heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists
without the no one would know of the wonderful things that our above has done for us and what he is doing for us now
of people have never even been camping
do homework projects and store important files
if we could less to other serious problems
i like my garden very much
think about the ones that do
then at libraries there are also those books and magazines
teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting
now that you know about the positive and negative effects of computers which side will you choose
knowledge of suicide is also something i think should be available
when this happens people stop reading the book and other books in the same category
when the author finds the dilapidated ghost town he is still high spirited and amused
with all the entertainment a computer can produce who could hate it
it is because you know what is right and wrong
normally the would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly
these are my personal views on why things should not be removed from shelves or anything else
if they get on that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offensive by that
i hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people
the books we read are the property of all humanity and should be read by all to educate us of our mistakes as well as our triumphs
the author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in
the features of the setting affects the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy
so instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just sensor them
everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like
i would teach them the subjects with real and deep information
you can chat long distances without being for it
but some of those books have a meaning behind it
they also allow you to talk to people even if they are far away
i have read and seen a lot of books in my life time
lets use music for example some music is nothing but screaming and cursing
when we look for information on the internet you would use yahoo google and other informational websites that you need
everyone that has used it said it really improved there reaction time
you can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding
you can tell thanks to the computer we talk more to his parents than he used to
the man feels like their is nothing left and its the old men who caused this
the feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
you can use computers to meet people from different countries
another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society
we should take time to read some of those so called offensive books
he was doubting that he could make it alive
the little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us
to learn about love math history and much more
it is so much easier to do that then look for books that has all the facts you need
after explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory
was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house
its like he forgot we were even the reason why i think computes should be in the state of
dear local newspaper i overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer
these are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir
one reason computers are good is the communication
we ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive
in doing this you for the most part prevent the children from entering an area that is not age appropriate
he was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road
best of all when you forget to write your home work down you can go online and ask one of your friend what it was
this year the summer season was unduly long and extremely hot
when that happens why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal
that is the law and i believe this is a good thing
and how important my family is to me
you can tell someone what is going on and call the cops
have the books and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are
these are just some of the great effects computers have on people
so i emailed him and how i get a response and i fixed my laptop
next there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely
how would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys
on the occasion of the festival he continues his duty for helping people to celebrate the occasion peacefully
everyone is different everyone has their own story just like these books do
are these books you want your children to be reading
there are also criminals on the computer
this effected my life a lot i stopped going out on weekends with my friends i always wanted to stay home when my family wont out
they never go for a jog or eat healthy foods
unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones
the author wants to show with meaning that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic
in conclusion people should not be on computer too much because of their health and their privacy and also to be sure not to meet strange people
not every parents chooses to censor what their kids get at the library therefore kids have different interests
it have bad language in it and a bad theme to it
it makes it twice as hard to do a simple task with a computer
computers open doors in the world
in the novel by the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned
dear all computer lovers i do think you are all spending too much time on the computer
if someone who hurts themselves hears this think of what could happen
many of these features affect him in a negative way
for example all the children magazines should go with the children books
it seems you cannot always make everyone happy
when i tried a drop or two it had the flower of battery acid
different websites with tons of information and true facts really affect grades of most students
i hope that my kid whats to be something that he likes to do when he grows up
the libraries needs more than one copy of a book so they will not fight over it
many people think that people overuse their computers but that the users fault not ours
the school playground also becomes alive with the students
this story about believed in yourself and never giving up it was a story about perseverance
to show or emphasize that if the hibiscus a plant reminding her of her home can over then so can she
if you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate
one way was the heat
you can use computers to research different things
you can also build new things
the author of winter hibiscus decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings
thank you for taking the time to read this
if you know what i mean
we are promised the freedom of speech as well as press and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both
i know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair
she knows that her winter is her test and that when she is ready shell be able to take the test again and be successful
in the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books
if they are taken out of libraries this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library
both of these things factor into the setting in a desert with no water affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day
if they had a computer and playing games or talking to friends they would be like they are
an example might be religion
computers are making our lives easier day by day and who knows what they will be able to do in the future
in a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive
for example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding
the computer is also dangerous because you could have inappropriate pictures posted on websites of you and not even know
the mood created by the in the memoir was happy
if we need to know about slaves or slavery we can go to our library
dear newspaper people i think that the effects that computers have on us are good
also in the a boy challenges his society because they too censored certain things
computers are becoming a household item in the and around the world
you see the struggle the hurt and the pain the family goes through as starts to walk with the monster also known as
and he appreciates that more than anything
when does our first amendment right to free speech with censorship and too much censorship meet
in my opinion i would think they have a neutral effect on people
inappropriate books magazines and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library have
by the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again
for example in the third grade i had to research hammer head sharks
then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a tar like substance oozed out
i think that many would agree to this if it was proposed
computers are a way to increase responsibility too
now i would like to the time to talk about is mentally when you go to learn
all however betray a sense of fear in their content and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization
with computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like
it is okay to be on a computer for twenty minutes to a half an hour
banks teachers even cashiers
magazines also offer pictures that in recent times would have been illegal to put out
whether they are used for school or just entertainment they are used for a good purpose and are always helpful
also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process
as we know is written by the victors
if we did not have search engines life would be a lot harder
parental concern for their children is also a factor
i also love video games
so i feel that mother is the prettiest person ever i have had in my life
it can mess up your health
he had made it to a bait store for water at last
his friends like to play with him
having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem
i have three reasons for this issue and they are and
i never knew what it felt like or how did it feel
as a result that book was banned from libraries and schools
he needed to find a place with water
when springs set in flowers burst into bloom and the earth seems to be smiling
no one can get in job by spending all day on the computer playing games
my brother and his bride sat with us to eat
libraries should never remove any material just because it be found offensive
last i checked the is a democracy
books newspapers and magazines are good things and they could be bad things
he also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route
now with the internet i can able to talk again
this could effect your emotional heath
the drains started overflowing with water
some with to become rich
his family helped create a good home with love
there are many way you can get this information
i know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not
when your reading online you just read what people say basically rumors
examples like finding things out about history
this is why i think computers have a positive affect on people
without the internet we would be very behind on important news updates around the world
clearly this is a great source to use
these books i agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races
computers can improve learning in a variety of ways
sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it
dear local newspaper i heard what you were saying about if computers are a good or bad thing
this story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture
be a sport person and one likes to get free online are websites like and so you can
ever since the invention of the computer people have seen promise for society
should have some type of censorship
another issue is banned books
you can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park
she knew what it was like when she was young
i know that everyone is not the same and feel the same about everything
even family and friends suffer when computers are around
it provides numerous shows and articles with a huge array of topics
its easy to say that he literally roughed it having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva
the setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot drinking his water he would soon run out of water dehydrate
the hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph
if exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke
the men gave the cyclist directions be what they remember when they were younger in age
think about that one
we all know that is garbage
that makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any
even protective parents allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate
he had little water and his area had tough terrains
nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries
computers organize data by keeping documents in different files computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career
computers can be negative but it all has to do with self control and how you use it
to finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year
other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment
by jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen
a person who works especially with bricks stones and cement is called a mason
they either put a person down and be completely negative towards them or they are positive and say nothing but good about them
the mood changed near the end as well
so more people would rather watch a movie
i could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about
all of these sites allow you to find family members friends and many more
one example is when he learned the definition of family
overall i think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive
people minds would not be wondering learning or being kept excited
how would we be any different if we did it
it is not necessary to take the items off the shelf
is keeping these things from our children lying to them
therefore causing grades to go down or not complete home work on time
that is the fault of the parents
in my opinion the computers could make that room a little smaller
the use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented
when you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life
they provide a lot of information
you are exercising your fingers
a library has many different things found in it books magazines movies and some have music
second you can make online job applications
i have read books that people have told me were not appropriate and then nothing bad was in there
we need to stop all this over protection in our libraries of all places
the setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain
kids can use this as samplemodel essay and write your own essay
no one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know
what has ever happened to freedom of speech
computerized can take over jobs quicker easier and cheaper
people can use computers to learn online
i would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching
the geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same
i was so happy because it was no cost to me
the struggles of one person be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow
certain thinks should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion
having to computers can help students to learn
the libraries and stores also should have the right to put whatever they want on their shelves
people gamble through online poker
its all media and entertainment
this summer my father taught me how to ride a bicycle
if you think about it each and every one of those billion minds thinks differently
some of my observations that i have seen were not really good
people make their own decisions and that is their right
the internet is for searching up all types of things
everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings
we all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits
sure you might get complaints
some people like reading books magazines some might think are offensive
the different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence
the wardboys were also equally careless
there are the major benefits of using a computer
so what are you waiting for
the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy
computers and technology ruin your time with your family
books must be read we must give our consent to their knowledge
i like things that some people might not like that is just how human nature is
that way anyone could go in the room and listen to whatever kind of music they want no questions asked
on the logical side of this the more a person knows the more power one has
i am a student of the eighth grade
she simply grab her computer and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button
such as falls rain forests etc
you should be able to have freedom without removing anything from anyone
this solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them
you can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is
people are offended by many things every day in life
you cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time
my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends
perhaps we will find nature more interesting
moving along i want to talk about how you can get information in a instant with computers
is a very true statement
computers are a magnificent tool for new things
there are websites that have math games and school related things
all you will need to multi task like at a library you need to find a book and talk to people
computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society
schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all
you need to have a limit
the pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst
most books have a true story behind them and i believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life
support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices bring
she would try her hardest to make smart moves and make it to a town as fast as possible
in the memoir from home the blueprints of our lives the author created a mood for
the knowledge of people would be limited to only what the library or the government would want them to know and that is not right
i am very fortunate for having a computer that can help with not only school work but my social life and how i make friends
like an online school book it can get information on just about anything
first of all people will get fat
it could be offensive to them but not to someone else
i have no idea why any person would want to take booksmusicmovies and magazines away from us
not to mention the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home
also technology is rapidly advancing and sometime in the future i think libraries will become extinct
the aid of technology our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist
i also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will
at one point or another in life we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends
the setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist
so if is something out you don believe in stay away from it and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it
everything we saw had a story to tell
one subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times whether fictional or not to his or her own opinion
as you can see computer have a negative affect on people
this feeling is without words
if we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read movies to watch or music to listen to
some street beggars are thieves who cheat people and steal their things
so get up and write our local news paper telling them why computers benefit our society
there are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes bad language scary scenes etc
then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library
doctor who is expert in the connections between health and computers surveyed people
in the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is
computers help us see the unseen
they always had each others backs and had many celebrations
he even maintains a sense of humor throughout writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men
girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess they also have to be flawless
you can talk to people long distance
and people have slowly began to deal with it
the reasons why be people would be less active people will not interact well people enjoy nature
no one was around because it was the desert
censorship in the what is offensive to some not be to others
also computers prices are constantly rising
in conclusion internet these days are very good for people
in this story the setting affects the characters dramatically
it was just the other day i sat down to read a book about a musical that i wish to see and there were nude pictures in it
then the heat got him because there was no shade no water left and the sun just beating down on him
age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set
if you wanted to get new friends or find anyone who go to your school and you might not now you look them up on your computer
these different optical affected his mood and how determined he was
most of all remember how much you can achieve with a computer
that clearly shows one of the things we need computers for
computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world
where do we draw the line
people can gain the effects of laziness little brain effort and lose interaction with the outside world
its ability to do such should not be compromised
no not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive
so does the heat from the sun
also most have been in sex education class
computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and computers even allow people to talk with people online from all parts of the world
the final reason why we use computers is education
finally computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other
even though and i were close i felt as though was always hiding something
over one million people on the computer daily
she is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance
when he talks about his heritage he speaks about his food home and music that gives the reader a sense of pride
another affect are the hills
and the last thing that is more important than a computers is enjoying nature
in fact most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms
dear computers have really made an impact on society
the hot sun glaring down at you just is killing you not to book a vacation to a tropical island
i believe computers are the best idea since pouring gasoline on pancakes
well i agree with them
that includes the variety of things humans are interested in
it hinders expression
then no one would be able to find books about their religion and no one would benefit
the rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist author
they use profanity show naked pictures or take about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age
after that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more
television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer
or they can skim over it
yet if this is truly the case why does the censorship debate still rage
but if people changed with time then there would really only be a few types of music
clearly using the computers takes time away from family
i could not do my events for science so i got a on it
if you are on the computer you on family friend time that could be being used as a fishing trip or a walk in the woods
opposing ideas should be presented
there is a solution out there but we just need to find it
like i keep saying its only a click away here is another topic online banking
for my conclusion all these reasons are true and computers are the greatest sources on the planet everyone do you want education or not
you can even talk to people online from around the world
as for adults their movies and books should be censored too
a major fear among the parents is the inappropriate language or scenes that be described in books
i remember several years ago i attended a and the party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released
she relates the flower and geese to herself
censorship of anything makes a child more immature
public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people
fresh our will help that maybe going to the gym or jog outside for a while
sure riding a bike might be easy but being a cyclist is so much more difficult
when it comes to looking at magazines movies and music i still have the same opinion to a certain aspect
these are necessities for all people to have access to
as this rather large man walks around the counter towards father steps in the picture
things like exercise socializing and homework matter
the freedom of speech is one
books were made to keeping people wondering learning and excited
or some thing that fun or i think or beneficial to me
dear your at home and you are on the computer
furthermore kids of all ages benefit from modern computers
something that they want to express by telling raping
some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society
many people go on vacation and what brought them here has when they sat and places
public libraries are just that public
so i hope you understand and agree with my reasons
also i hang out with my friends every chance i get
likewise there are other times that close family or friends can talk to each other over the
most libraries are divided up into different sections there is a section for adults teens and children
my first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class
some of these relatives live very far away or not have a phone to talk on so you can talk to them here
we could use a rating just like movies do
censorship is a great problem
in all of these examples there could be bad language pictures and messages
would you be offended by seeing something like that
in my opinion books that seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf
which is parental guidance or and up
the variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular
but of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time keeping computers would benefit in so many ways
or they might just give up on it all
furthermore of parents agree with experts that spend way too much time on the computer but less time with friends
then bad days started
also you enjoy listening to music from your computer as you personal entertainment
mirages appeared or so he thought
all his fruits are very fresh and juicy
with others updates worldwide and information on school all are in a great piece of technology called the computer
well in this letter i am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society
they might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for
millions of spend countless hours with their eyes glued to and monitor screens
first of all children often follow after what they see
he searches for a place to rest where there be water but he is not able to
in paragraph four it says how they would always have family members over for dinner
they are very useful for teens in school for projects but they benefit adults in many ways too
well i believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library
most importantly you can communicate with family and friends online through or
games teach you to act with a team spirit
fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire
however i tend to believe that the computer is not necessary
maybe there are some books and things that people or not find offensive
a house is not a home without family and a family is not a family without its trails struggles and happiness
finally computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost
throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some
would we decide to take these books away now
these are the various moods that the author had in the memoir
a book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life
the argument continues because in truth there really are things that ought to be censored
they are also very convenient and easy to use in mu opinion
sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair
we must respect and appreciate their hard work
when he talks about his friends being like his family it makes people grateful for their close friends that they have
using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members
their are parents who have kids in school who do not care about what they learn or what they do
i like most of what i hear and see
dear readers on the current debate of the effects of computers i believe they strongly benefit all people
it created a happy environment to live in compared to the many other towns with horrible racism and segregation
maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear or see
are offensive and are bad that they should be removed the reason being is because of younger children
some people work at home on computers
he was losing hydration from all the sweat and he was losing it quickly
he passes ghost towns abandoned buildings and diamondback snakes
it is the idea family that fueled his loving childhood
i believe that people have the right to read listen or watch what ever they want
if you already have a computer then your fine
i understand that people do not want there kids to see them or hear them
if you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it
however some movies are okay for some people and their age
so cultural should not be censored although it could have a section just for that type of material
i think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again
when your at a young age anything can happen while your on the computer even worse things can happen
some lines from the song are i get depressed i cut my wrists in every direction
a library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is
infamous dictators such as burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think
he should show good results in the examinations
most computers come already installed with the necessary programs including or some form of a virus protection software and other simple software
in conclusion the water being bad the terrain change
magazines in my opinion should be censored
computers also are very addicting
there are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on
this story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up
the computer craze does not stop kids will continue not to go out side and get to have some fun
students take part in various curricular activities
the dehydration lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive
most adults have been through school and are educated but computers help them make discoveries about space the human body etc
both teachers and students have benefited
he should get up early
also the internet is used to just have fun
in this particular piece the mood was proud and festive
for example if a child go to library they see a movie that contains sexual activity and decided to check the movie out
my father went to drop them back home
not even a library has all the information you need
with the a stuff i gave you it helps you see the out look on stuff that is offensive on the shelves
you can choose for your children but you can not choose for others
obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself
you doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth
they not all mean harm towards me but towards other readers they could
its good for your health got fresh air
this shows that his parents taught his something important without telling him by showing him
so what do you think should this be such a law
during lunch and dinner we have cereals in the form of rice wheat and whole grains
he gets to live a happy life in their new home with their new friends
people are just getting to fat from sitting and doing nothing all day
these are just two methods of that the computer enables us to have
if you do not like people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you then you are not going to watch
i was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter
we would have to read so many books to get the information
imagine your favorite book song and movie
everyone can use the computer for communication with friends or family
we the believe are children and adults are spending too much time in their laptops or computers
for example many people use or to connect with friends
all these features combine together to make the situation worse
therefore i believe censorship is wrong
i will just turn it off or not read it anymore
we walked to the school compound
there is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer
and a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world
a computer around is easier for school also i remember one time i had to write a page paper for and it was due the next day
there were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed
lastly censorship is a communist trend
in my opinion i would say that computers have negative effects on us
in science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done
also abandoned buildings
you save time and money on gas by doing so
computers have helped children and adults learn increased the amount of jobs and helped law enforcement
sale of ice creams and soft drinks becomes a regular feature during scorching summers
to become a meson is not to easy
i know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored
most importantly will not only benefit you but will mean a lot to your family so what are you waiting for
if you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials then do not read or watch or listen to any of them
through this she realized that life in is not so bad and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday
what can you say about that
having an endless source of information in your own home
there be children who look through that same section although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries
i got most things done and in a matter of time
also just like checking out a book how you have to take a test over it called reading counts
his home was always filled with life love
we learn to look for and understand deeper meanings
that way your door to freedom will be open
then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy
why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways
as far as opinions go everyone has one
there are over students at
in the story the narrator says she lifted her head
they say you still need exercise nature and time with your family
young children look for role models someone to follow therefore more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see
the following day he was allowed to work on the computer and got three pages notes
everyone has his likings and disliking
the features of setting affect the cyclist
where going to talk about your you bring on the computer all you would with your family
for example i read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders just like everyone else does
computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air
kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects
the cyclist was riding in some rough dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal
first of all the author creates this mood that makes you want to cry
finally is one of the most obese places in the whole world
we all have a right to learn to explore new ideas and to expand our minds
i however do not believe that these things should be removed
conclusion local newspaper this is why i believe that we should keep our computers
this is what i think should be done with this offensive materials
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
in my opinion the effects of computers are not good
the number homes that own computers and they rate each home owns
dear local newspaper personal experience i think that computers have a positive effect on people
computers are also important and helpful in the home
i interact with my friends of us population between the ages have a
for example talking on the phone costs money and why would you money when you could text chat voice for free
their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media
on the internet there are more graphic photos and some websites give false information on subjects
they can have live video chats together
so the parents should leave it on the shelf and prevent their own kids from reading it and let the other parents worry about their own kids
its a new way to study and do other things to learn in a fun way
authors use endings that make people wonder so people think
you will have more time to exercise talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town
second remind her of her home
my father explained to me that the sound was due to the landing and takeoff of the airplanes
i moved closer to them so i could hear
options are let it happen now or let it happen later
so i believe that in a way an excessive amount censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing
in my opinion people should be enjoying things and not spend most of their time on computers
computer allow many people to become with each other in new and effective ways
everyone is responsible
it inundates large area under cultivation wrecks public services and makes life miserable
did you know that people use their computers extremely often
they usually stay up all night playing games or going on
so now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing
fem the ghost town to the bait shop it was all a challenge for him
also at my school you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz
everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates
it would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading
books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got
i remember when i was in grade i made a new friend and she moves to in the after grade
i hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive you think about this
have you ever done a report on on a far away country
some of the reasons i think this is because like in paragraph
children that have read books or watched inappropriate media can sometimes change how they are like
your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways
the people are spending way too much time and not benefiting
using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones even if you are communicating with them on the computer
you can order order all types of that needed to
this quote shows that for his parents loving him he gives them love
in conclusion i think computers are good things
dear the opinion on computers be the same as others or different
in the memoir the author creates a specific mood to entice and interest the reader as they read more about his life
she appreciated what her parents had done for her
or if the person is eating while being on the computer
one reason was that he was in the desert
did you know that of employment is from the workers home now you know
the kids we saw years ago were on the right path
i you cant get if then you will be forced to get it by stealing
they give him determination because each horizon he sees gives him hope
features we find in many railway stations
as it is adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse
in conclusion the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey
choose quickly the fate of our society is in your hands
also for the rated x magazines movies etc
so let me express my love for computers to you
during the april holiday our family went on a trip to hondkong
most people have different taste in books magazines or movies
its not like your going to stop your son from looking at a
here all the homework for the class is listed
people who are not punctual waste the time of others and their own time also
someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt
my sister is on the computer and she never goes outside to enjoy the nature
this allows people more time to go have fun with their lives and not have to worry about plannings
most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online
that is one reason i think the books should stay on the shelves
i think it should be that way about every thing
these are reason why the society should take back the computer
he also talked about how the road was rough
i once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the religion
i think that this would be fair for every one
if a person thinks that a song should be removed from the shelf and it does get removed what about the person who did not find it offensive
teens want to be able to read about they can relate to but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe
they also can help kids learn how to and other things at a very early age
therefore i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society
the mood created by the author in the memoir is many things
the next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions
in paragraph the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out this breezy jaunt
this music is able to be accessed on many computers especially in public town libraries
i would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication
this book was a fictional story taking place during the
with the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants they work together and kindness prevailed
secondly publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society
the most important thing about this is who want these books censored or gone and why they want to remove them
does somebody hand write every paper that comes out
sometimes we use books but the way most people use is online researching
your opinions decisions outlook on life yourself is one of a kind
we the people are the ones that want these books movies magazines and music
for example the family and life and even if you miss them
music should not matter to parents so there should be no problem there
this can lead to obesity or other weight issues
and that concludes my or should i say your next top story
finally you can type your essay on the computer
ghost towns come across very old run down and dull
this very bad because when your addicted to something you can go back
beliefs are important to people no matter their age gender sexuality or their race
he talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love
they provide plenty of information communication and even entertainment
some parents take offense to a show on the television because they don believe that is right for their kid to be watching
that is why computers are so helpful
as the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence
technology is a part of life today will continue increasing with the years
i feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed
i am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries
i am writing you because i am concerned with the health of the town
paragraph despite the overt racism at the time this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what
the book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes
despite the different customs elsewhere all of these cultures were united as one family
media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online which can never be permanently removed from public view
magazines are stocked on shelves in stores and on the front will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself
books are separated by age too so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate
well if one person has a right to something then it would only be fair for the other people to have a right for the same thing
while he was biking he had to go up crippling hills
greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted
this is our future if we allow the censorship to continue
but she had herself much preferred it to a big mac
movies are a whole different thing now the things that happen on the movies get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with
in a big town or city there are many post offices and their branches
on the internet the family could find the numbers the and some information about it
overall i think that talking is the main use for computer
lastly computers just help for the need of entertainment for people
next day they changed the house and shifted to their son’s residence in the nearby colony
but a parent might get upset that their child is hearing reading or even seeing these things and might band it from the library
computers is one of the technology that helps people
she is only eight years old
dear our local newspaper computers have a huge effect on people in a negative way
communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people
she decided to retake the test
i also find it faster to type then print
everyone i hangout with is not in to freaky novels
libraries not many people like them but most people do
you like music movies and more
not only was it rolling hills it was also getting hotter
it is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with
much throughout the story this is the mood
as you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information
i believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want books are made to be read and looked at
aside from that computers make life easier
are you supposed to explain to your boss in time
the library could get in a lot of trouble
we must play as a team individual game spoils the chances of victory
it gives a whole new look on things
this way you want go to place not knowing if jobs are available and seeing none
i do not believe that books regardless if one person deems them offensive should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on
if you go on a family trip each year to the sum
as you can see computer benefit society helps peoples hand eye coordination
this gives the cyclist his main conflict the lack of water
the last time in the story the regard they will always remember her homeland
this aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road
instead they should spend time outdoors with family or enjoying life
rappers most of the time rap about female killing people and etc
the author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents
actually was a very good book
to begin kids are in school more than have of a school day
first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it
so then again you have to have parents permission for that to
laptops make work possible on the go to
but until then we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today
everyone is on the computer these days
how will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned
detective stories tend to glorify crimes
from my own experience controversy is the reason that books are stricken from libraries
my third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising
with freedom of the press anyone can write about anything they want
so grateful appears to be a keyword
censorship is just bad in general people should have the right to make their own decisions on what they want to read or watch
the third reason is for help
did you know that four out of five households have a computer
the computer is a great tool for communicating with other people
all of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen looking at pictures of nature
if there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent or read
if you agree you can do something about it
sent over the faster than any service
libraries have been around for ages most of them started out small and now are big
this climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert
the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory thought and so on
people would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online
people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive
the first reason why computers are bad because cause addition to your child
many children and adults too walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention
there were many different conditions that effected the cyclist
anyone can write and post an article on the internet even if what they are saying is not true at all
only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water
libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library
if someone where to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable
i think computers have a very positive effect on people
how would they complete their work
as i mentioned computers allow us to communicate with other people
computers hold a lot of information many people learn things they have never heard of on the internet
thank you for reading this and i hope i persuaded you enough with my reasoning
she walks home and finds a hibiscus
yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of any human etc
i am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them
people buying selling talking and shouting
this lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily
some things just need to be left in the past and kept there
dear local newspaper the question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society
i chose this mood because in the memoir he describes how nice it was to live in a town where people cared for him
if some people like to chat with each other they use cell phones
as he started to head out the scenery changed
computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday
playing sports or getting some fresh air
taking them away would only take away from the number of people who visit the library
perfect democracy can be achieved by educating all people in a country
we took a joy ride on the camel
if adults want to view pornography or read accounts of extreme violence that is their business
this is only one reason why i think that although they are useful computers are not entirely beneficial to our society
adults would most likely be playing a rated game and watching rated movies
three of those things are heat lack of water mud its anything town
just cause there is some kind of material they find offensive does not mean that everyone does to
the author wrote of rough terrain and isolation
traveling to or even under water
for example would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us
so she go on the internet start looking at different styles and maybe she could become a famous journalist
i think that libraries should not remove material such as book music movies magazines
books have been around for a very long time
they are also kept in water parks and tourist spots to perform tricks
therefore computers and other things are nice and all but are the worth getting fat or loosing touch with your loved ones
if people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere
the flower was very important to her
the things that i would find offensive would be racial discrimination gender discrimination or religious discrimination
i believe that has a negative affect on people
writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel or tell a story about yourself or someone else
this is unlawful censorship
every we go there is censorship
i urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet
children that are not in school or in the early stages of school
that is history in this world and they should know it
without computers a negative affect people
he deals in readymade garments
we need computers for life we always will need to use computers for every single day of our lives
but just remember your grades cars and your weight
my grandmother would tell me stories about before they had computers now my dad works on and he tells me stories about his day
he is my class fellow
a library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves
i like buying off the internet
if something offensive is found at the library should it be taken off of the shelves
the mood of the memoir is shown in many ways
if you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information
now if you organize your thoughts on the computer and are able to look through them again at why a huge alleviated
at anytime about billion are on some sort of electronic device
no one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves
our is written on the pages of literature
he writes about his parents in a way that informs the reader that they were extremely good people
you want your kids citizens to get fat and lazy
some books are just too good to be banned
this is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast
i believe that not all books should be banned but some books should
when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns
when someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors
instead of removing the books others love to read what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music
in conclusion many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many
she buys the flower because she failed the drivers test
people need to cut down on the electronics
kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting
if you want to go to college but you have no time you can take classes online
that is why they put it in there so they can get their money off of it
out of students that they spend more time indoors than out
this ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice
for the same reasons safety stop education sites that are not appropriate to see
one of the books we had to find was the
imagine yourself a white year old boy growing up in an all white town
using computers could be fun for some and work for others
there are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view
first computers are not good for your eyes
the only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him
thus his major concern is the lack of water
just by using a computer you could easily go online search friends you want to to better and chat with them
if the books were meant to be read that way then so be it

the mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness
i can and will say i experimented with life
they are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer
it is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health
in conclusion i do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries
we are setting up our weekend plans online and a lot of our social life is there
advancements in technology are very practical and have a positive effect on those fortunate enough to have a computer
i believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that

with a computer you can even get your house hold groceries online
they can video chat talk look at peoples pitchers and keep updated with them on the computer
this is why the story ends like that
people go to get what they like to watch read and listen

going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time
first of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise
adults mostly use them for business
also the road became very rough
the hibiscus seems out of place and is determined to survive when the snow melts
he does not pick up so you walk to your clean shiny black computer
dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge
although you do need computers
computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball football basketball or a gym
so i think they should change it around
libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves
without even leaving your house
also the terrain was not good
a child was left inside the house
it was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left
what harm could it cause to see it now
in my opinion people can also learn from computers
some people find these things offensive but i think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things
how could something so harmful possibly be good for our society
sometimes internet is not good for children
however the computer does not just show places
in the end we all have our rights and we use those to choice weather to read or listen to certain material
some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable
in reality computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it
so i just video chatted with them
lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night
this will be her goal for the winter till spring comes
by sending a letter it can take a while
without a computer in my opinion things would be a lot more stressful

because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising
we also learn about their traditions and culture
i like spring season most
other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though
but at it a good source of for them
that means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate
times are changing fast and the sources of the worlds history and school subjects can easily be found in the corner of the internet

movies that are rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie
i believe spending too much time on the computer is bad for everyone
also computers let you learn a lot about history
there are websites on the internet and among them there are game sites
also i think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her motivated her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future
in other instances things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed to checked out
also there was no one around
have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive
the computer so with out computers you would have to travel in a car waste money and the air with your car
so blazing fast speed to chatting with distant relatives
is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves
you can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school

so why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because its offensive to one person
so far all of the towns have been deserted
this book has many valuable ideas and lessons and is considered a great piece of literature
computers effects many people for what it does
thing about his setting that changed was the hills

when the librarian told us we were upset because us girls loved to read those books

also kids in school use computers all the time for school work and to learn about new things
and with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it they would be greatly offended and very upset
therefore you can interact online
next couple of years from now people will want to get rid of something else then something else
let readers have their freedom
movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me
but why do some people not hire them
i do not think certain things should be removed from the library
should not be removed if they are found offensive
therefore i believe no materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places
oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch
or do they lose customers and stop giving the rights of freedom of speech
i was so happy cause when she moved i thought i would never talk to her again
clicking a mouse typing away are only moving your hands not your whole body
the mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic
it was also a way to end the story in a good note
i believe that if there are offensive booksmusicmoviesand magazines are in the libraries
like the geese she is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter
i think it offends lots of people
this fantasy is possible you continue to use computers
another free way to talk to people
but some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about
i think they should be able to keep them
if someone discovers a book or movie that offends them they should not make a big deal about it
i find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the
in this memoir the author creates a mood
there are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way
there are plenty of other readers out there that would like to read that book and to learn more about politics
and because you can go on at all hours of the day kids can get bullied at any time
people need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport
it is however a dark omen of what is to come is censorship is freely given power
in fact a study done by the board of ed
it takes one person to make the difference
today you just have to go onto and type it out
computers are very important to society
children all around the world find themselves wandering through the library every day
so it looks like access to a computer made that trip to easier
even people in perfect condition
this however is not acceptable
are they good or are they bad
everyone has their point of view
our media is very powerful and should not be censored
yes the wonderful world of technology
containing inappropriate language and terms
besides the other factors computers retard teens learning
you could make plans or you can talk about upcoming events
a doctor’s life is hard
overall computers serve many helpful purposes for people
maybe you read books go to school or even watch
the need for a or laptop is obviously great when you work
computers are just amazing

we all worry about our children having to keep a constant eye on them making sure there not getting into something there not supposed to be in
if music or movies become a hazard then it should not be welcome in the library
just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it
these changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate
the author proves and says how we as grateful
some reasons include the put down on races comments in the book how the author wrote it and who it was written towards
bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing
book censorship is a big deal in the world today
computers let us look up valuable info
we should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read
it provides us with many kinds of fish lobsters corals prawn and sea plants
censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society
dear i think computers have a positive effect on people
the same goes for books magazines and music
other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families
he had been a slave boy
however she survived the brutal attack and deleted her account
then the libraries movie business would be over
so throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory got some water to drink and got new directions
she is not giving up on it
almost everyone that has a computer and is addicted to it has glasses
no one makes those people read those books its by their choice
it is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely
on the other hand the computer has that many people are connecting and communicating they can set a plan to many critics have people and spends the computer
the author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love
getting rid of a material can lose someone information about whatever they are researching
i think it good to have computers because when your younger and no more friends you have been really to them but you with them
your family is much more important than a silly computer game
the computer also helps you to learn
everybody would be the same then
music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion
the made the majority of the people and were not very smart people
it all depends on where you are cycling
something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued
i do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves
computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented
the computer should be used to talk to family and friends homework research work and you bored play some games little games on the computer
he did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees
helps them with school and taxes
they have a great significance for students

although i see where others come from about removing these kinds of materials from shelves
in this quote the cyclist realizes his isolation and begins to become more determined to reach his destination
these life of can also become dangerous
that one second’s care might have won him a prize
you can save anything on a computer
still they put all of these things in the same building
they have a right to create what makes them happy
that is why i strongly believe that people spend to much time on computers rather than
in conclusion personally i do not think censorship is necessary in libraries
dear people use computers more
i think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature
books now have a lot of crude text and humor
with not them the parents should their child to and from the library and the time
what good does that do anyone
why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays
computers save time and does a lot of work
this is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward
my second reason that i believe computers are good to have around is
the hibiscus is also a symbol of her life
for example you can search online and they just have pictures food
i believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst
so much so that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting
emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say
the only people who make hay there are the hawkers
also by saying which is still with me today and i am grateful
their is nothing funny about it
also if you are talking to someone that has a name of someone you know
computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another
but there will always be a crowd it appeals to
computers definitely have a positive effect on people when they learn new things
he said if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time
is it not cool anymore
if one side of the story is not told how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent
ever since they were invented computers have been advanced more and more even years
that person can have there opinion but other people have opinions that might oppose the other persons opinion
even great novels like the in the should not be banned because of their content
they think their is a cure for obese on the internet but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing
another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused
last one not story this lets the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well
to talk to people far away is better to talk to on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other
these are ways how computers do benefit our society
millions of books were burned and hundreds if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government
at the of the day i think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public
so there was several moods in this memoir
the computer allows you to connect win people who live faraway with out having to travel to them
these are my three reasons why i think computers have a good effect on people
but now my parents have to consult me to leave the computer multiple times
i also know people who use the computer the right way and they are very happy people
libraries are for studying learning and entertainment in a quiet peaceful place
the mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir
students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed
after she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change
we can email back and forth every day
i know the other day i saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim
my first reason to this situation is people will spend less time exercising which can lead to drowsiness or laziness if you stop exercising
no matter what there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials
if you just take a step back you notice how valuable something really is to you
dear local newspaper have computers ever hurt anyone
if everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary
is for all of these reasons i strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community
when ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read a days
you would forget to say hi and how are you to your family
some adults like the original songs with the original words
you need to think of everybody not just yourself
it is something we cannot change and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated
in conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired hot and thirsty which affects his entire journey
the features of the setting affect the cyclists mood throughout the essay
we are living in a better world that it was years ago
my three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family not enjoying nature and getting less exercise
research has proven that computers are a positive effect on people
censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views
if you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to google and type it in
the child’s relationship with the teacher determines the grade and academics of the student
read on to find out how you can talk to friends on the computer

this is how setting affects cyclists
rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences
people are getting no exercise due to computers
last a good way to protect this country
dear the things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed
there are not any kind of books that could be deemed offensive in any way to people these days
it could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more
the features of the setting effected the cyclist very much
most people do not go to libraries because of that
libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside
this bait store gave him water and a good map
it can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk
our society is maturing too fast for young children why should the library take part in that
the technology of a computer is farther than any other item
everyone has a different taste just like in music
they would be able to learn so much more than before
today the agricultural department provides the necessary instructions for paddy cultivation
all libraries have different sections based upon age
it allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally
first of all people spend to much time on the computer
would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window
some people find books music and movies offensive and not suitable for public libraries
so that made matters bad
just because the student chooses this topic does not mean that he or she supports it
she told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants
dear newspaper my name is and i am a student that attends
some people have to be on the computer all day
to her the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives she knows that she too can survive
the desert contains a very high temperature which makes it harder to endure physical activities
another example might be television shows like
many students around the country forget homework once in a while because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily
my opinion is to let them stay
the author talks about how thankful he is for his parents love and sacrifice
the sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels
also with these online pages they cause to much and could lead to fight or rumors
lastly everyone enjoys different book themes
if a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material
such as music there are all kinds of music out there
you can also learn about far away places like
if its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it
so now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school
you can past messages play games or simply talk to someone on these websites
she thought that maybe i would think what i see on is not a bad thing
one person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual
for example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much
no because them books or materials is not for everybody to look at
also the hibiscus will survive and while she works towards her goal it will develop more
after an hour or so i woke up and went to my parents’ room
whether those reasons are for education or for recreation the libraries have reasons for them
makes you lazy and keeps you from you kids
does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want
books teach us about what wrong and what is rite
thank you for your time
all these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now
this just make me want to say wow do you really want to be that upset about a book
sometimes it can encourage us to buy things we don’t need at all
he feels happy in this area
if you would like to know what the weather will be like you can look it up with a computer
foreign communication specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations in the fields of both business and government
the climate in the story also becomes difficult
more than out of people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal posted on them
by removing the computer you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well
i would have to say no
no one insight not a building car or structure of any kind
while on the computer the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise
my first example is my father
this makes travel to and from school much easier
parents need to sit down with their when they have questions and discuss the truth with them
it all comes down to learning and there is no censorship on learning
dear local newspaper i am against that computers benefit society in anyway
in a survey taken in a local magazine should that of people are on computer and
these types of movies are offered in libraries nationwide and are easily accessible to children

now it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for
i believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive
since computers are used daily especially by young adolescents it is likely for that child to become obese
nowadays the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site
my mother asked me to get up and prepare for school
his parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the barriers to work for their children
computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles
a person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song or book without getting disrespected and offended
the author created the mood of happiness that the authors parents went through such struggle but in the end everything turned out fine because they have family
all of the materials cover a really wide range of topics
incredible numbers of emails are sent everyday

a large number of men women and children were waiting for the train
for me censorship could go both ways

in the story winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with when they come back take that test again
if you love a show on to and you missed it you can find it on computer
living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood
so take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it
simply teach your kid what is wrong and right
get up off of your comfy computer chairs and take a walk
his parents are loving people and so is
but others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff
he said yeah so i went to a local chatroom on the internet
when i grow up i wish to have a horse of my own like brownie
if people began to take away options on reading materials some kids refuse to read at all
not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do
however there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus
i bet some people have never thought of this but computers can lead kids and maybe even adults to cheating
they can answer almost any question you have and have name a lot
music is used for many different ways
gyms are way better than computers
now we see that games and sports do us a lot of good both physically and mentally
i support advances in technology
to do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn
the weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water
everyone has a place were that feel like they belong
so she wanted to take it again around the time of a new beginning when the geese fly over again and the plant grows
rather than just getting rid of it all together
he told me to look to my left
example is flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
he takes me around the farm
what the country finds however is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies
also kids have fun playing these games
computers are important to everyday life because it helps your children be more independent and learn how to use different parts of the internet
first off computers provide you with communication skills
is used by teens and adults like and for one reason only to socialize with friends via computer
the library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers
he admired for his parents strength and perseverance
when he does find a town with water the setting to relieving and better for him because he find water
in conclusion computers are great machines
means that his parents they had showed him everything knows today
the author uses symbolism when he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant just like the girl needs to be to pass the driving test
the people were crying “fire”
the town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt in that it is increasing
dear newspaper people you might heard on the new more and more people thing computers are the benefits of society
the computers can help you stay connected with them
then i went back to print it it had been erased
they are easy to learn how to use you can connect with old friends and even learn by going to an online school or college they offer
to have his parents teachings be the basis of his life he must have had a deep connection with them
they also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your such as comprehension clinic
i hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society
we talk on webcam and chat
in an ironic twist the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a factory that has been abandoned
instead of going on the computer you can exercise more play outside and spend more time with family and friends
they have to go jump to come another day
the most important reason is because it help people learn about different cultures and ways of life
one person love a book and another person hate it
she asked the other students to be kind to me
instead of instant messaging call them
okay yeah we have cell phones but not everyone can afford them
computers are excellent for students that play the piano like me
you would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people
meeting new people is a good thing to
lastly they save us money everyday
this is a quick and easy fix
movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence
it reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role
well i might just be able to help
children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media
many people also speed up their word by using the computer
also tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online
dear newspaper technology is a very useful thing but is also a bad thing it makes people lazy on
everyone has a opinion if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else
this not the way to be treating a device
so i believe and i feel that she must be the most beautiful woman in the world
dear have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library
or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them
they struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships
those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country and they should not have access to them
he ended it this way to show the themes of this story
since libraries have many different kinds of magazines books and movies it is not always a safe place to just let your child roam around
there all made by mankind but with a bit of technology
during the passage do not exceed speed limit the cyclist endures many hardships
offensive books and movies can cause many problems
with computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves
even teacher es lets the teachers communicate with parents so it helps you communicate without everyone being in your conversation on the phone
the sun was beginning to beat down but i barely noticed it
so come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use
i love my personality
some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head
the kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away
learning about different cultures can teach us many things
the fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone
it seems the cyclist has a lot against him
you got to think about other people in this too
but that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people
if they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go
not for anything bad
do you have picture files laying your house
take an author like for example
the people in his neighborhood were very kind and generous people
play games with each other
people who think that the books in libraries should be censored are fools
if there was nothing out there that offended anyone how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong
also a study by the has shown that there are roughly fewer conversations at social gatherings than just
the mood that was created by the other was happy
this communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset
it protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age
two computers are good for you
but think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages
it was meant to catch your attention right off the first sentence of the story
definitely read on to see what computers can too
finally he reaches a bait shop and his water and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future
moving you fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise
even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be
my first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer
for little kids i think that they should have things censored because there young
people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music
the stories are obviously important to the author and important to the readers that enjoy their books
one of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to
we can prevent these issues if we take a stand against computers
of business meetings are held over the internet has benefited work ethics
the birds flying overhead are headed south for the winter for shelter from the cold
does that seem right to you
this is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people
books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything without a purpose should be thrown away
whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song
when you think of computers what comes to mind
heart disease is the number one cause of death in the
but i was unable to get over my fear
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
one more thing to take into consideration is the authors money
people have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about
if this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt
you can use the computer for playing games that are related to school
would you want your children reading watching or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them
now that fact bring me to my next point
i have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in and etc
another example is when your on the computer you can listen to music and talk to friends or read
also it can help you get on ethnic back round to learn about faraway places
we can find what is healthy to eat right away you can also get one of those fits for a computer
the mood created by the author in the memoir is loving caring and gratefulness
they teach new things
in the memoir the author creates a very peaceful mood
i am going to explain to you why we need computers to do projects
there were people from different states and different areas of the train
this was my first experience of traveling by air
dear local newspaper i disagree with the affects that computers have on kids
for example a friend of mine is on the computer quite often and has developed a weak immune system
the computers a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies
or are you going to walk over to those miserable books
people everyday become and being right with so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines
this is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail
so back to would everyone or some take to books movies music magazines
in the south most treated as dirt
some people like mysteries while others like to read romantic books
so in my opinion i think computers are a good thing to have
if you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf
he tells them how important the fruits are for a healthy body
the feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water
the plant represent her home
she felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life
they also have educational websites that help you with your work
same with many other people
finally i think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake
for example walking the dog or kicking the soccer ball around
the story was ended like this to show that the girl will have a new beginning
we get newspapers early in the morning
music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing
if a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library it would be an empty room
it is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students
he stays on the farm till the evening
they can also make grading a paper easy
well without a if you get up and get active it will be the best decision you will make
so please help me fight to put more people outside and make people more active sounds like a pretty good cause huh
with a click of a button you should be going to or a nice vacation
you have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to
dear newspaper in our town more people are on the computer each day
you could even learn about a computer and all of its history
i do not believe books music and magazines should be removed from shelves
he had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted
since i have two computers and one laptop i have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer
an example is the death of and how he caused the deaths of many on eleventh
however this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone
music can make you think about what your life has been throw or miss the person that has died because they listen to that one song so much
the heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride
the people do not need to look at something that they find offensive
others are made of bottles and clay
she will take the test with a new out look on her life
i know this because the text says and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke
so honestly no one can say that a certain books music movies magazines etc
there are a lot of examples that make me think that
he was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake
the main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert
the cyclist finds a building but it is abandoned and empty
some people who are obsessed it can be problematic
with a computer everyone can learn about people all over
no one deserves to be offered the damaging violence of uncensored books and music
should be removed from a shelf due to content
where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages then advantages
dear local newspaper did you know that just about of the people in the have computers and use them daily
my conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone
people with work to do might never get on
people can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer
it can be done with the help of the mortar and pestle
that can get you identity stolen
having family come live with you till they get back on their feet
if libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive then a library would have very few to no books
this is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue
i have read a book that contains sex and drugs
you could do something quite like draw a nice picture
and are many ways to chat with people like over the phone on a cell phone
the most popular and common of a computer now is communication
i had my mathematics examination the next day
one way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account
in cities the air gets mixed with harmful gases from factories and vehicles
this topic now poses a question all censorship bad
because once they are gone then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because of the books that they find interesting are gone
computers can help people meet new people online
kids can use computers to find information they need quickly
believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books
all major corporations use computers to invest sell products and store information
these ratings help censor things to a certain extent
from then on the stock to his map
it is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material
everything that was on was not as bad in my opinion
the increase in population is due to the fall in death rate
the hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times
very beautiful sight
this is the amazing experience you can get from going outside
they just think think my way is the right way and the only way
besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short rolling hills
people worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age
its truly disgusting
need to make changes to what they do during the
for all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job
people need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not
when using your computer you could be working out or exercising and this causes obesity
she believes she will pass that test in the spring when the time is right
with material far away people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community
a library should be a place of enlightenment
the reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle
the word definition of allegory is a story within a story
just another useful effect on people
there is not a person in the world who has not had some form of communication with others
we become illiterate without books magazines and other things of that nature
computers are used world wide everyday and most of the time is used for a good reason
it gives them time to grow up themselves
the community was close so everyone felt like family
still even with this point made some not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want
different people find different topics offensive
money weight and sleep
everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books
the internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens
these health risks are a concern but peoples safety is on bigger issue
the author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home
what types of things do you go to the library for
so stop reading and use a computer
that certainly does not benefit society
to become a meson is not to easy
when seeing the familiar plant
do you go on the computer for hours every day
a library where works of literature such as to a and are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages
inside the forest there was very little sunlight
if the same item appears regularly on the list remove the item
when i have to write a paper on someone i usually use the internet
than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want
i am one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find the book offensive
this paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging
we should invest money in business only if we have experience in the business
some people use the internet for doing homework
books can make a very deep impression on whoever reads them and sometimes these impressions are not appropriate for the reader
the shelves should stay full of books movies music and magazines
with any luck id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat
the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale economics takes the cake by a mile
if we need to know what a homework assignment was we can just chat with a friend
censoring a book is taking that persons ability to learn about and understand a certain topic that was censored
is mentioned in the last paragraph
he aces the reports and continues to use this method
the sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room
so the setting most definitely affected the cyclist
man has always been interested in technology
she could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever i went
when a student forgets the homework they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night
a home computer can save you time when you want to research a country person or culture
one day in summer the clouds appeared in the sky
for example say you have a turkey in the oven and your so in the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off
before finding the flower the author terribly missed her old country
computers are only helping in aid in the growth of society
even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects
in our society there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain
people get offended by things everyday
some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them in the house
by looking it up on the computer you can become an expert on the country
why does it need to be there in the first place
many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products
the author is very grateful for how his parents gave him a home and taught him what a family really was
that can lead a person to being very lazy
also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination
i recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer
in fact muscles start it is recommended to get in at least one hour of exercise of outside play a days
they are also good because they help you communicate with friends and help people make plans to do with friends
have you ever felt that books are offensive
censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to
i know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me
i would think that computers give a positive effect on people
maybe it could turn out in a good way but really what are the chances of that billion to a thousand
well i have done my part
the cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid
in the text the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist
both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home
an other reason why is educational is because you can type your paper on so your teacher can actually read your handwriting
finally computers allow you to learn about other places
there are around billion people in the world and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media you do
if someone put something way out of the ordinary and that person knows that they should not put the book on the shelf they should automatically be fired
so try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life
it is not illegal to have certain types of music books movies etc inside a library
once people are allowed to censure books or other media they would look for words with negative connotations
at first he was very motivated determined and hydrated
my third reason give people the ability to learn about faraway place and people
shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at
in his community that was filled with hardworking immigrants came together in great solidarity friendship
no one has the right to censor anyone else
it is a lovely thing to be perfectly loyal to a friend
heed my advice allow your kids the freedom of internet
but it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view
it would also be braking the law because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech
in paragraph the author welcomes the reader into his past by speaking about his childhood home that loved
when she says and beside it was yet another old friend
this is how the setting affected him
bad people are afraid of him
and as time goes on it can only get worse
but it does so we must censor certain things that people get a offended by if they saw it in there public library
but when they do move its to get something to eat or go get their phone
i feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society are right
there are many things said in the memoir that express the mood of love
i have seen what happens when you take a book off the self
during his time at he discovers that he is a homosexual
little kids like fantasy and picture books teenagers like romance and others like nonfiction
typing on a computer in leisure time is a skill that will be looked for everywhere
in conclusion i think that we should have computers
thank you for listening
today people are sending pictures to and from each other via emails
interacting with friends and family is always a
you can also find the nearest hospital
the mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness
the features of the setting effect the cyclist in do not exceed posted speed limit

the author is using the
also with computers people can communicate with people from across the world
the fashion of the and is just a project i did last month
we came back home after a few hours
this realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope
now i can see how books are an excellent resource in society and how they provide for amazing information however it takes years to publish books
they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff
people have always said that books can take you anywhere you want
are turning people against each other
studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat then if you shop on line
most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections
people would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature
i am i have been playing in for
the flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother
to continue offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation
they allow people to learn many new skills get important work done and even socialize
i then go and brush my teeth
therefore we should buy and readonly good books
first of all he ran out of water because of the heat
realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending
no one can base censorship on one belief or idea because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of
dear i think the use of computers are good here are some reasons why
they make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus
last but certainly not least the computer is a great resource
it is much more fun to be with someone in real life then to talk with them online
who want to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library when the internet is there for your use any time
if you have a long distance friend or family member there are how many ways to talk to them
they made a simple little house into a great home for everyone
the mood the author sets is very loving
its a good way to relax
if anything they help together
people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take

that means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life
these people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day
he also orders his flight tickets in his computer to go to
computers are a great tool to use
hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed
that is that great thing about technology
the people agree with what stated
when two opposing types collide a burst of energy is released
currently there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society
over of have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with
you will know that computers are good for our society
i think the computers help your brain think more and computers are advanced technology
people can just not pick the book up and look for another book
so parents can pick what they can read
it is a part of history
surely read on to see why computers are very important to us all
without the internet probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good
i already know the answer
which is obviously the mood of loving because there all a loving family together
in this quote is love
one day i even heard a little quoting lines from the
in the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways
computers benefit society greatly
as you can see those are just a few reasons i think that computers have a positive affect on us
this helps because first it makes their it also can be changed quicker and easier
first reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us
mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends
as grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him
is the only good and the only light comes from
i have never came across a material that was offensive to me but maybe someone else has and it really offended them
there i was shuffling my way through the library finding the perfect books to check out
removing books off of shelves in our public library
the ability us to get more education
the back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area
for the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things they could be in a section far away from the children
the author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder
so him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying
if we let everybody take books off the shelves then there will be none left
after school kids usually do homework or go out with friends
research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten
they should not be removed from the shelves of the library
he talks about how great it was growing up in his home
recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends
they learn how to exercise
these are major benefits to society and everybody should embrace computers
they instant message listen to music go on or
the library should provide a section for so that they can read appropriate material
the cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain
i wish i could sit inside it and fly high up in the sky
in this sentence the author really conveys his of thanks of his parents to the reader as he praises them
we live in which since founded has been all about freedom
the setting of a desert in the uncultured
so the computer help me on spelling it also makes your project look better
and you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button
leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe
man has not recognised the importance of trees
if the music is rap pop or country they could just get it from instead of the library providing it
these are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen
virtual people are not your real friends and family
there are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime
i learnt a lesson of my life
too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday
if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life
went up to the main desk and started complaining
another good thing that you could play games with your friends like all types shooting games racing sport arcade all type
of all he talks about his family and the love they shared
we can do this by helping to keep our sources of water clean
with five kids and one laptop who would want to be happy
you can look up stuff on the for your homework and other stuff
thinking its okay because somebody that is not even real most of the time is doing it
this later resulted in him becoming dehydrated
at that point there would be no turning back
also these websites cause people to their social skills
the things to come are determined by the thinking value and beliefs of these leaders
we cannot control everything that people do
books magazines movies music etc
please consider my reasons when making your decision
many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same
now would you censor that
next is that it could cause rate success drop down low
in the obesity rate has reached an all time high of
my first reason why i believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online
they make the hearts of the people melt
allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for a resource for knowledge
the author chose this to end the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart
i loved each moment of it
there are some books though that i agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive
suddenly it started raining
nobody can make read or stop reading things like that only you can
he was riding in a desert which is very hot with little civilization to help him
indeed many people in this world are influenced with bad things
ever since computers were invented not only have they downsized but became more and more useful
however hes still optimistic finally it funny that it was once a thriving little spot
eighth grade teacher
but is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are
and it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test
it shows that even though she really loved her hometown and feels and remembers a lot back then
what are you going to do
they also appeal to a lot of people across the world
censorship is purely opinion
when the book magazine or movie was create it not have been made to be offensive
everything will be gone because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad
not everybody is true over the computer
books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library
do you know what computers were intended to do
when choosing a book you have to think do i really want to read this
this setting was nothing like the old men were talking about
the social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social
on many sites on the internet set up person locators
that statement tells me that the author feels well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members
computers are addicting also because of online computer games
kids can use this as samplemodel essay and write your own essay
a public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers
i have many friends living in and many cousins in over
after she failed the test she bought the flower
also some books help prepare a person for the outside world
some were discussing the law and order problem while others were discussing the rising prices
maybe if you have to search something for school the computer can help you
for example my cousin is in a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat
libraries contain plenty of books music movies and magazines for everyone
you would be amazed on the amount and different things people can get offended by
also he started out fine then he started to become dehydrated
she had a website named to learn
people think that have young people exposed to this offensive material will effect the choices they make and how they will react in certain situations
they affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains
i believe this because computers benefit by its online internet and overall help in other things
i go to my school by bus
not exactly all books are offensive but some are
one way communication in computers is my instant
technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor
removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept
at first people waved a friendly hello but nothing more
so if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him
we should be grateful for friendships
this not a good way to spend time
and you just cant figure it at
when i moved to i am always typing something
sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing and discovering the real world
with the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of where they type every day and work hard
we should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own
these are simple and save lots of time
the complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story
for example if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences censorship should hardly be considered a crime
people get offended when they read or listen to certain things but does that mean that those things should be removed from the shelf
when the cyclist tries to get water from the pump she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all
think of this of kids
internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination
so now you see computers are a vital and useful of daily technology we have at reach
so let it be the parent choice of what there child can see
that is my opinion on computers
and with no town for water he would be thirsty
other material that could be offensive could not only be to children it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well
libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner
life is easy a false statement
this story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you
most importantly the use computers is influenced in schools
if the human body overheats it becomes sick and unable to properly function
although health is a problem community is a bigger one
the offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there
are people today spending to much time on computers
they do not understand that what they do not be a good thing
this would be bad for all children
if you use the computer it might break or not work properly
i was once that little kid who opened the wrong book at the wrong time
dear local newspaper well many others i believe computers are not only good but beneficial
that goes with magazines and books
to find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news
can these books be offensive
being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration
to me computers are just a trouble in our lives
i wanted to row but my father was afraid to let me do that
with this the author clearly shows the mood for love and happiness
and the reason why i feel like that is because i passion for computer
this saying teaches us the value of time
should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive
it enveloped you into its world and you felt every sensation it offered
to begin when someone is talking to another on a computer they never know who is at the other end of it
adults and children are spending huge amounts of their time on computers
i know personally that it has help us
libraries can have an affect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be
there are too many options like when comes to the books movies music and magazines
anything at all that you need is at the tips of your fingers with a little help from your computer and internet of course
i think that they should throw this book away
dear computers are helpful once in a while but out of people believe that they are a waste of electricity
computers are being made with webcams or you can simply buy a detached one
another is when they are talking about the racism and other things but says how the neighbors have united
art should never be censored for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society
computers as we all know are a limitless source of knowledge
thank you for taking you time to read this letter
that person can inspire another person
they get the magazines and drool over how the center fold looks
well my time is up here
he wakes up again early in the morning and gets ready for school
computers not only let students write reports they also allows them to save them for future uses
what is appropriate in libraries these days
we can limit our use to two or three times a week and only use it for important reasons
now it is our rite to save our books if we do not then us as will be lost
as i was going through last weeks newspapers i saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers
the younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older
so if anything the books that be offensive to people only show you that you will not like everything that someone writes or says
the feathers of the ostrich are very expensive
after seeing that i thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me i would not of had to see that
the cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him
our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward
he plays games the time
first materials that one individual finds offensive could be viewed another way by many others who enjoy the material
there should be certain limits though
also they can spend more time doing things with their kids
but technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people
i was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again she is giving herself time to prepare
have you ever had to write a report
we need to inform our state about this problem
then i saw a little child playing on the flute
computers give negative effects on people for example lose eye sight interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise
computers also allow people to talk online with other people
that is the business finding talent where it is seldom found
usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends
the police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails
games puppets and movies and easy books
muslim people celebrate ramzan at the end of the fasting period
its altering a authors work
the features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of rough road ahead do not exceed posted speeding limit
they need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel to act to do even to think
computers are a helpful interesting even fun peace of technology
but no one really makes a huge thing out of it
if there was a type of censorship it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy
threats were found online from big websites like
those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world
you can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away
second people do not spend as much time on the computer they get more experience with social skills
the test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied
everybody is overworked
also computers make life a whole lot easier
the ways of teaching this are typing and clicking on something people when they type look at the keyboard
now that i have told you all of the benefits of computers you
computers are always being used for several things
i can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night
adults know more about the harmful language but why influence them to write the bad things or comment using mean tones
finally once you have your information all you have to is your source
kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button
thank you again for listening
he thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned
also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
we should all respect authors and what they put into their books
in the end the problem will be solved
its not because he created the fastest computer ever
they allow you to learn new things are very helpful for school and work and they can keep family an friends connected
you can learn about the history of presidents countries important people musicetc
we have all been to a library at some point in our life
the parents were determined to make it to the united states because that was hard to do
if people are always playing games the computers then when they go out for a jag
in my hamlet i was an early riser
you can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country
rather than your child on the computer learning chatting or just playing games safe and sound in your home or community place
this is causing kids to become less active
the author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes
so eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find
it wouldn be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way i am
she gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test
reading is in individual task
the mood portrayed in the story was family and friends are very important and they help what you will be in the future
the boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them
also surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes
so would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer
it is unconstitutional to restrict any form of expressive speech whether it be books movies music or magazines
over the past decade the percentage of people using computers has increased by approximately
are they amazing or what
the author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement
all the body parts and organs work in coordination with each other
many children and even adults are hooked onto the computer
the mood of this story is very weird
the postman collects these letters and sends them to their destination
the hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding
the housewives buy vegetables and fruit from him
computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it
after reading this essay i hope you will agree with my position
paper burns at degrees
next time there is sunshine out no matter what season it is go outside and take a break from electronics
while she stares at the hibiscus then the geese flying in the air she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test
every citizen should be aware of the sad plight of disabled children
in conclusion libraries are a good source of information
the money the give to the government is to take care the homeless people
another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house
i do think that a magazine is a book
i think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together
another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out
out of poll takers agree that finding on the computer is quite easy
until she got her hands on a computer
educating a child is carving thoughts and feelings in his mind
plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop
even though they first came to the
too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities social time and health issues
she believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding that cannot pass the test until it is
although some people find certain items unoffensive other disagree
computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you have missed as if you was absent
what is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another
she then kept cycling and saw nothing
finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over in the past ten
some ways the cyclist was affected is the lack of water was the biggest problem he had
maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to do it
some materials are very offensive but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries
its obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research talking to friends family and leisure activities
computers allow the everyday family to see new places through photos online and people through the internet
the author is explaining that he had family friends over to his house to eat almost every night
i hope i have shown you as an independent person my statement was true
after reading all my reasons and opinions i hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries
the hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future
not every one has the guts to say something to the school
i hope that this opens up many peoples eyes
keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn
once that child becomes and adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library
computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything
so as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression
are living a modern time society is advancing everyday and computers are a huge part of it
they are required by some to enjoy a good book
now answer me this much time do you spend on you computer
this thought process is immoral
movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with
my next argument against computers about our bodies and minds
this caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired
when example of happiness was that his parents passed on their culinary skills and a love of cooking
i know i get home from school i can talk to virtually any friends online
also the air is good for your body
it would solve a lot of problems
there needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups
computers computers computers
so this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting
sometimes we fear failure
secondly music and movies have censorship
there be material that has racist comments
lastly there are predator online
i really consider leaving computers to what they do best helping humans
that he love them anyways even if it is good or bad
its all about how you take the song when you first hear it and take the messages out of it
if that book is taken off the shelf it is restricting other people such as who would like to learn or read about that specific subject
that certain mood was love and family
let me explain my point of view
the mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be i believe love
in the end i think computers benefit people around the world
lastly computers show you so much about history
it is a world someone loves to enter to hide or confide in
the fruit stalls are full of mangoes bananas and
for younger children they should not be able to check out a that is more adult
seriously if someone finds the song offensive then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song
censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food
the person might have to live the lesson to learn it
trees also are home to many living organisms
i am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem but there are some movies musicand magazines
what would those books be without those statements
the best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you
part of the reason is because they rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book
also he ran out of water and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around
it drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this
there was a downpour for a short while but soon it turned into a steady raining
he thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean
you have a project for school and you need the right information
some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy
some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions
romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds
you could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life
so next time your reading or watching something that is offending you
the author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment
musicians also play music of course
some books magazines and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone
most write books create music and produce movies to express themselves
surveys show that out of students use the internet for information or projects for school
a safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the or people claim them to be
like a section for older kids and people
articles about views on the death penalty
they help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers
this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs
so keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them
each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise
man cuts down trees to get quick profit from them
in the story it says the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
about of our world enjoys nature
that is great for the brain
it is emotional because the care and love for each other
take for instance the movie
some music be offensive to other people but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library
you want this to happen to our country
the author created a feeling of homeliness and peace
first of all computers allow people to meet and interact with other people
he later runs out of water and becomes hopeless
another example is you can use it for projects get all your information and be prepare for a great project
by me knowing that i am aware of the fact that children are not exercising
it all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in
during this time they could be exercising going to the gym or even taking a walk with friends
have you ever been offended by a movie book song or magazine
its quick easy and it works
make certain items restricted and red flagged
i can see where some things in the library are very offensive and where somethings are not offensive
about of collage students go online and do challenge
the people of the world always have a priority
you have a computer you can learn new things about places you never knew existed
i for one do not like doing things if they might offend someone
like for instance if there was a missing child we know the description so we could help find him or her
however i do not believe they should be removed
that is what parents are for taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that
you find a place you go on find good write come down yet of of the computer finish paper get grade that is good feel happy the end
the author set a mood for this memoir
i was taken to its class of the primary section
but then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience or even to a whole country
it went from happy appreciation and an explanation of his life to deep incredibly personal and to his complete thoughts
the way this author wrote this memoir he created multiple moods
was happy that his parents that his parents left everything for him to have a better life
but when you stop all of a sudden you played for hours
nine out of ten people say that since they started going on the computer a lot they have not gone outside or exercised in a while
if the is left without certain materials there will be no creativity
even without software to block dangerous websites computers are generally safe
as a kid we look up to our parents
without these sites there might be less divorces and more happy ending fairy tales
the cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition slowed him down even more
things are fun and creative because of books magazines music and movies
for instance libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves
for example my friend stay on the computer more than hours
example my uncle lives in
some books are not suitable for kids
by starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands
books like that usually deal with bad things
this story also gave a warm feeling by the story of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven
the mood is proud because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are how inviting the house was
my younger brother and sister are fond of my dog
the a lot of his in the story
censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people
when you sit in front of a computer your eyes are on the screen
also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth
the class teacher was a kind lady
while using a computer you can many things
of kids chose to go on the computer than to exercise
what is the big issue over censoring movies disks books and magazines
this means that he cant collect any water to drink if he runs out
computers help you learn things better than any other technologies
i am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school
i believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it
they talk about history and guns and drugs and wars and all sorts of other history information
second reason is that what you might think is offensive might not be to another person
until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts no matter what those thoughts were in any form of media
they were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine
secondly kids in school use computers to do homework class work research for projects or to go and study island and education
the hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better
computers are very useful to people of the world i bet that the people who make them will make new ones that can go on almost everything
when i was younger and i said that i was going to read a book i was really reading one
just because a book talks about the and dying be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults
this is my point of view on things
in the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them
hello you think computers are having a great effect on people
dear editor i hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good
the people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer
but it teaches adults and kids new things
a library is a place you can go to read write and relax
another thing is that either parents set a time on the computer or they take a way
clearly this is a great benefit
later this food returns to the camel’s mouth and the camel chews it again
then i will not get or read the book it is that simple
first of all he explains how much he loves his parents
for example movies have ratings for different age groups and books could do the same
you say you are going to play for minutes but they are so addicting you play for hours
instant would all have drifted apart and never talked again
i got the home work and got an a all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others
libraries could collect viewer comments allowing people who had checked out an item to write what they thought about it
sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people
we can learn that are going on from far away
there are children around the age of in there and younger too
just yesterday i read in the newest issue of that a man married a character in his computer game
stop writing on that pad get up and type it on your computer
computers have changed the way we research and finish school works
she needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her
dear newspaper computers are everywhere in our nation
if i find something very offensive in a store or online i should have the right to voice my opinion and that opinion should be taken seriously
children are easily affected in behavior maybe they just saw a movie of and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him
are offensive materials offensive to everybody
so you have total freedom to purchasecheck out any of those rated movies
a house consists of roof walls doors and windows
although technology is used in everyday life from communication to searching for information it can slowly us the human race down
in libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate to serious or violent
did you know of students use the computer for the games and online talking
therefore computers are a benefit to society
they shows she loves her parents very much and always will
secondly computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places
and then these are the people who just like looking things up
upon finding a book that is offensive the reader then can make that decision and not read the book
my second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining
this is the last reason why i feel computers are bad
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
but do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them
even though everyone says they are safe on the computer they are not
it is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel versus the exceptional writing style
lets move on to a bigger idea
first computers have a negative effect on people including chicken because computers are not safe
i believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive then they should be removed
as a matter of fact the leading in is no longer cigarettes
so for those reasons i think computers have a positive effect on people
censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left
this can prevent many problems
which means probably grew up in a life without very much violence
yes people these days are affect by the internet greatly
they all most create their own company
this means that friendship will wont see each other if they spend all day on the mental health when they turn on the computer
it takes more than food to be healthy
parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children
to me this is an image of selling sex
also computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily
this could not of made his ride easier
this basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want
students have project after project assay after essay and its a lot of work
there once was a young girl fourteen or fifteen who loved to read and listen to music
this research can be used to write essays in school
with computer you can now send a letter faster then before
you know what hows about a trip to or or
also have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too
they are so independent they do when they go home from school is eat and play on the computer
computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life
slavery is a strong bold word that represents a horrible thing
i believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf
the topic of and the be found to be offensive because of what they stand for
dear advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today
i mean you can read about history world news and you can research many different topics
features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates a
in some places books that are banned to other places are celebrated
i can find out what is happening where i live by looking up your newspaper
for students it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer
off the shelves just because of certain people
he is doing something that be lovers is heading for a beautiful destination and has found a short cut to save him hours of time
how do you tell on someones maturity level
people can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books
this quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing
it is up to you to continue using computers
i joined in and we chatted until
dear newspaper people are spending to much time on their computers
another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored
people chat on and email and people are bullied
the features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist
i think that computers are helpful with projects homework or letters
first of all you can learn about places that are around the world in a click
one day when my mother work me i did not feel like getting up
because some books and movies are bad to show little kids
that group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material as well as the people who do agree with the material
science fiction thriller romance how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library
so my overall opinion would be no
for example an older woman is looking through this magazine and she sees this teenage woman taking drugs or being half naked
well i sure think using a computer has a great effect on people
parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games
because of overpopulation there are unemployment poverty and food problems
a is thought of as a learning zone
he must not be afraid of anything
despite limiting exercise they encourage learning and the exercise of the brain
then the terrain in changes when he says flat road was replaced
when i get home i start using the online text book for my math class
the memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad
if you want you can also get a web cam
so without computers i would practically never see my brother or talk to him
like in the end it says i will take that test again
now you have to call a repair man who will charge you even more money
kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it
at the end of the essay winter hibiscus by ho it ends in a positive manner
dear the computers do not benefit society
do i think offensive materials should be removed from libraries
this way information is never censored completely
online shopping can be very helpful
is this the right thing to do
lastly in a computer you basically find out anything you want to know
chatting online is also a terrible thing if you abuse
then again it influence them in a fantastic way
oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation
number of unemployed is rising fast
the press is allowed to print anything and we the people read it
computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise
people are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens
in this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures
that is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive
in a family it is kind hard not to
there were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of
any concerned person technologically challenged would agree the countless ones on the computer are no good for the health of our country
then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found
the main character says the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke
literature are there for us they teach us and if if one was taken away it would start a riot
not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way
but as a student looking into the future i have a opinion
taking certain books off the shelves have a negative effect on people
a and final reason i think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family
for me computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications
would you want to vacation to a place that you know nothing about
even if that includes some of them being offensive
what if that was all the person read
the question is should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive
items are all over society
teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books
this leads to my next paragraph
many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button
yes some people do waste all their time online but they have issues
one subject that be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases
the train was late by one hour
people have different cultures and beliefs
she is now out of the box and in a whole new world
i once had to do a class project on and got a just by using a computer people can look up information on countries for pleasure too
people have to learn to just limit their time
in almost all of books someone be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else
adults and kids spend to much time on online pages
why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses
even walking home from school with a friend is a good way to be outside
shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter
also it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake
the setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help
so now i hope you can see that computers effect people in a positive way
self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world
playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better well keep you busy
the mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family
i was trying to find a book to read for an essay i had to write
no wonder so many people like computers
those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey
the library a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out
the diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time
at the library there is a music section movie section and lastly the books
an ideal student should give respect to his teachers parents and elders
when you use a computer it is completely free
this shows that by always going on the you hurt your academic skills
doing some sort of sport has another advantage
in the end my father agreed
the mood created by the author in this memoir was happy loving and warm
you get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity
censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass
go ahead get the explicit version of that rap song or sometimes it might already be bad enough
there are many useful devices that help us live our every day lives
everyone has heard this saying
the trains were moving very fast and people were travelling hanging by the bars of the footboards
then they will be mad and then that just an other fight
i was in grade school when i fell in love with the show
lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying
that says or all these are found in a lot of magazines like and sometimes
computers have a positive effect on people because they are very helpful
with computers you can see the the tropical reef fish or the at the
also people want to learn the lyrics to the song
he did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him
there are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today
books movies music and etc
read on so i could let you know how and why these things about the computer are helpful
you will be doing a lot of damage to a lot of people
she took me in her arms and held me tight
dear newspaper i think people need computers
censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality
i disagree computers can help keep family members that live far away in touch
when you go on the internet you can learn about cool places and plan vacations
a person who leads a good life is a gentlemen
libraries have always been an outstanding source for information
i used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her
also when you learn about something
even that have more mature students get offended sometimes from the books their reading in school
with the new flower she feels like shes starting over so that shes able to pass this test that seems important to her
i personally disagree with the concept
well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer
i took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it
this just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness
if anything the reader might even like the book and check it out
it’s difficult to find a house without a cat
they said that the earth goes around the sun
once you get onto a computer you never want to get off
the reason i am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today
computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper

those are two examples of how the mood is loving
the objects we are talking about are our entertainment it brings us joy and many smiles
i hope you agree with me
but then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information
please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them
the computer is just there
the do there kind of things because are bored people think that statement is true
constant vigilance is the price of democracy
if you miss a long lost friend or cousin just search their name and you can talk to them
computers are great for many reasons
or do you want interesting news that will keep you newspaper going
the poem the author speaks of his parents with great admiration
plus computers help people make money
she is also really sad she is making a commitment to get a fresh start on life just like how the world does every spring
thus creating a decision usually for the parents usually assuming they are the ones to but the album or the music for their child
but he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay
well that is your opinion because if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out
something that would be offensive to you could very well be beautiful to someone else
the story is somewhat sad
people have feelings if there going be hurt by something we should enjoy then take them off the shelves
just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer
also what about the kids that like to read
it also gives you location and dates of different events that have happened in what you are looking up
for example a game is one the most popular addictive games ever made
dear i think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right
furthermore people all around the world communicate thought the computer
he knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert
with movies the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else
that is how even came to be
it takes you deeper into things
this made him dehydrated
many trees get uprooted
this is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries
that is just one example of the many i know of
people are spending way to much time on computers because there addicted to them over weight and not getting any exercise
so there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist when they were on there journey
many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this
i want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out
the setting and the features affected him not only physically but mentally as well
you also use the computer to do work
i know that there is always something that pulls you back in
i understand the fact that some people take things offensively
so one day the child decides i am going to check out a book at the library
i would also use a computer to learn about far away places or even famous people in history
the shops are mostly small in size
if all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers
if you send by mail take at least days
magazines are nothing but gossip
the less time people spend outside the more energy is being wasted
the mood was a very good one that shows everyone that reads it that the human race can be genuinely kind and helpful
censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today
like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland
not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat but also mentally
being a daughter and teenager myself i personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines
in conclusion computers have a very negative affect on people
i believe that computers are a great tool for several reason
they left behind everything and everyone they loved basically a huge chunk of them and for that he is extremely grateful
he is also thank full for his culture
therefore he was in trouble
my response is that you just could email it to a teach friend or any body else
my computer helps me
do you ever go outside anymore
those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist
as you can see computers also help students education and just our everyday life
he thought about his surviving and immediately found a shop to and he could drink
technology and computers have came a long way
if the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them then do not check it out
it overtones the point in the story which is to not give up and the will to survive
people just need to find a way to it out
this is how the change of setting affected the cyclist
the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road i would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so
also its not always about what the library displays but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read
first it be a book movie or magazine that someone plans on reading and removing an item will let down the customer
is some people that think woman are just slaves that is dead wrong
the ratings are from to
if there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty
this is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry
imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters no paparazzi
my final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready
that is what i think was the mood of the memoir created by the author is
the experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer
if children end up listening to the offensive music or watching offensive movies then think about like this they need to grow up someday
they help you with things
this is the same for the books that are on library shelves
they might not be able to save a persons life
if you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night
you can send an email to someone and wait for a reply
this is great for not only school children but adult to
in some countries the donkeys are used to
if a song is beautiful and sweet but contains bad word in it is it a bad song
they given us ability to learn
in every book there is some form of material that people not be a fan of
reading in itself is a great pleasure
these are various programs
in the long run doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees
i stated my reasons why i think computers have a negative effect on people
also you can learn about local upcoming events and about the world around you
there are o lot of people in the world after all
a fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers
these plants would bear beautiful
my mother and pretty much the entire found it very offensive
should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive
the second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place
i think it should be one or the other
last but not least people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone
many books would be gone
i did not know what to do i was completely clueless and i had no book to write my report over
people are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health
you plan to play for minutes but the minutes turns into minutes which even turn into an hour
computers are very important and are life changing
if i were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine i would suggest you to take it off the shelves
there are many shops where shopkeepers sit inside with their
at this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated
these are example of the moods that author created in the memoir
to begin with people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than on the computer
it is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on
have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book
you will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world
libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way
if the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book then the child will not read it
computers help people stay in touch computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways
we could do tests on computers
and they are given the right to use it
so taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up
this would be useful for a school project on a country
a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
also you lost all your friends contacts
he then came upon that has do and abandoned
she vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again
i do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town city or state
just because one person reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call offensive
my third and last reason is their job
libraries have rated movies
he was starting to go a little crazy
the story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings
this is why i think that people are spending to much time on their computer and it is having a effect on their life
the mood of this piece is graciousness and happiness
it benefits society for certain reasons it depends
as students mature homework is taken seriously
i think most people can control themselves though i believe that computers are very important and also have a positive effect on people
recently it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society
that is what i think affected the cyclist
the author generally stayed in one mood
the computer has a lot of games you ran play on so it would keep you doing something
some movies could do without so much violence but they have to make money some how
for whoever reads this remember what we produces as media is who we are what we do and what we live for
my mother gave prizes to the winners
the example that i can think of is a movie that is rated
i say this because people can interact with other people online people can research useful information and finally computers help people find jobs and make money
in conclusion the authors moods can be described in many different ways
the computer is fun for everyone
i opened up the internet and typed in in and i found out that i got a on the report
should libraries ban certain books just because of some contend on one page
everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not
imagine talking to your friends not having an with his ever leaving your room
and one of those many thought to be impossible was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds
the mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time
also it does not matter to me if i have to pay for the things that i check out from the library
books do not kill people
he has a high moral character
one you can use them for almost everything
but others are like why not they are going to know about it in and when they are married also
does censorship solve any problems
a parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this
when that happens all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips
you guessed it computers
yes make sure all books music movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive
that way you can be sure who you are talking to
but you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so
i am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised
another reason is because its a good hands on eye coordination on adults and students
every one has different views on ideas and not everyone is alike
the mood the created was a mood of happiness and gratitude
do you have perfect handwriting
a wonderful educational source to use in schools jobs etc
he is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home
the temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left
music can also be on the good side too
other games such as the require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes
so is going on the computer really so bad
computers are way to burdens of work
they let us talk to people all over the world
we should never have the right to be able to remove these materials
that be way many are over weight
a lot of children use the library
therefore computers need to be used a lot
the tumble weeds show a distinct desert look
this crazy computing must end
nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child
history has given the world many a cruel dictator
the author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story
take i for an example
newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch
he felted loved because his parents sacrifice for him
i think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning
his caring and selflessness parents
the results were more than shocking with all of this in mind ask your self how useful the computer really is
the conclusion for the story is a nice ending
the subject race might come into play in some books in libraries
this is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and head healthier they feel they can can over the world
would you like to be on the computer and throw away your life
then when you have a computer for someone else has one then you would be able to see them
the last sentence in the story is significant
some and just other races get offended by these types of things
if you ever need to set information that not have to through the of bookthen a computer is the thing for you
that flower had given her hope
but this does not mean that that work should be banned
lastly i you sit on the you will miss out on the awesome life you were waiting for since you can remember
they have already caused exponential advancement
he clearly is very grateful for his family and had a happy childhood
if every person took off a book that they thought was offensive there would be no books left
i tried a drop or two tasted like battery acid
so in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things
computer are also great for looking up places
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that he is proud of his family their background and the way he grew up
second computers help people communicate with others
that could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not
in conclusion i strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf
censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world
he used several books to get information on the topic and i used the computer
for example say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes
as a result bonding with her mother erupted and it brought another day of hope for her future in her new home
you have the ability to learn about people and places easily and you can communicate with your family and friends
i strolled into my bedroom i noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk
hes excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
these are the reasons why the computers is a bad thing so remember these tips take this article into consideration
he lifted the cover of the basket
i say that there should be no library censoring
they have a critical knocking on their front door
and i would like to let you know what i think about the whole situation
has been known for rapping about drugs sex money and violence
finally the last great thing about the internet and computers is that you can entertain yourself through online games and movies
i hate all these because they will make us do wrong things
explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life
delhi zoo is near purana quila
computers are a key part in society and we depend on them without them we would all be lost
the best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone
our country has gotten smarter because of computers
computers make writing an essay really easy
you just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely
in conclusion i think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad
adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like
that was the mood i felt created by the author in the memoir
computers have benefited society in many ways
but i believe that typing it might be faster and neater for some people
for example about a month ago my back was really bothering me
a person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style
to strip the rights of a person is not acceptable
computers play a major part in destroying our health
there is no way to get those back either
others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy
computers are a wonderful thing to have in our society
this shows the emotions the author felt growing up
you could find ways to improve how you play or you to play that sport
libraries should have whatever they want in the library
you waste over days a year sitting in front of your computer
maybe a library will come across my article and do what i have said
i believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother
this is a very good thing
it shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test
you can keep in touch
or should we let them understand how it really works
how often do you eat dinner with the whole family
this law was enacted in the of and is still in effect today
lastly family parties and computers do not mix
the setting had a great effect on the cyclist
why should this freedom not apply to books
she then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant
is why i think there should be guidelines or rules
so is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault for not educating their children on the morality of such items
it is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided
i could finish my homework in minutes compared to hours
some books have material that might not belong in the hands of children
now you are probably wondering us
dear local newspaper computers are very important to some people
please when you are writing you article before and listen to my facts
computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone
we should be able to get the books that we like from libraries
there are gang stories of terrifying people such as
i am lucky to have mr david as my next door neighbor
i rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project and i even make some of my best project on it
yes you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online
do you agree with me that computers can help people
there are different kinds of channels that view these materials
why should the government have total control over the are exposed to
they have helped education reconnecting and are even at times good for the environment
that is how the terrain affects the cyclist
all this was caused by the setting he was in
my opinion is that they give you a very positive effect
there is no doubt that health is wealth
computers bring you to people globally but distance you from people at your job school or home
they can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive
she hear when the hibiscus comes back brings new hopes to the life to take that test for
what if their is a person that only reads scary books
do you think books magazines or movies that are offensive should be removed from the shelves stores and libraries
although people might find the down sides to computers they will always be able to think of a good side
many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is
computers have made life easier for many through communication making a positive effect on them
no computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often
when the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain
this brings me to my conclusion
just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive
when working out at work driving or just siting at home
my third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world
in the the people are given many rights that are often taken for granted
i mean its just a book it dose not really matter
one of the causes is the internet
i believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials
with dating sites you can find the perfect person and maybe go to the with them
any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way
it is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water
you are doing a fine job at writing at your job
this would solve many problems such as children being able to check out certain materials
you go and have many more friends which makes life in general much better
the setting affected him emotionally as well
those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication
those are just some of the many reasons why computer help
i once rented a movie expecting it to be a scary thriller about a killer in a trailer park
the author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope
another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water
there are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist
people also look up a lot of stuff that involves school
the library would lose people because of books being censored
stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances
he finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink
also computers can be fun and entertaining
he gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground
the meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living
speech about parents are the visible god
there does not need to be any censorship in libraries
this will helps us to live a healthy life
i think done all i could
this is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world well
these settings were hard on the cyclist
it is also a lot easier to find the
it is the parents job to regulate the reading of their children not the contents of the bookshelf
many scientists use the to publish ideas and experiments
i know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that but they are a small percentage of the kids
when the come back alive
instead of censoring items there is another solution
likewise if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person
on certain websites you can talk to friends see what your friends are doing you can even video chat with them
even if you buy the you are still learning by taking care of them
this can cause people in severe positions or even death
but computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun
his children are good natured and have good manners
what be offensive to one person might not be to another
but after some time the order becomes a part of our nature
at the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life
it is something that adds to the song or movie
lastly computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online
please help defend us kids in this case about computer use
there is no doubt that electronics play a huge role in this event
the author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir
you can learn about different countries people or even the recipe of apple pic
you can go online and get pictures games videos music or even directions to a place
let it go and stick to what you know and like
but i know this because its says then i will take that test again her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant
if we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet will stay around longer and we could make the a better place
some of the things that be hard for cyclist are the rough roads
after they had first moved to the they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play
now i will move on the my last reason
everyone in our neighborhood was out and trying to help put off the fire with water and sand
so they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that but it is not
the features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly
the computer is excellent
those children will either listen to their or not
what kind of influence is that on the children
although some people do not always benefit by having a computer most the time people are satisfied and do benefit from the use computers
and to that i agree entirely
my mom says computers are one the most hardiest tools in the world
i say this not to make fun of anyone but to thank them
also he says summertime rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain
there are so many books out there and odds are there is always going to be a book that offends someone
there are many different kinds of books in the library
i think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to
i once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers
when the setting changed so did the effect it had on the cyclist
he starts to lose water to keep him going yet he pushes himself to the next town
everyone should be able to read research or watch anything they want at a library
an extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online
censoring these people can and would be horrible
the internet and computers are waiting to explode and invade the minds of everybody
taking away their entertainment would be the same as telling them that they cannot wear the clothes they would like or drive the car they want
some features that are mentioned in the story are heat rough road long crippling hills and a abandoned grape juice factory
people like their options to be open and at a wide range
he is becoming desperate
finally the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist
many materials found in a library even if it is offensive can be helpful for someone else
people are sitting on the computer everyday eating and not moving at all and gaining weight
by cycling towards up and down no often it secured his journey
there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes
this shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life so will she
we need to something about these computers
people have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say whether that be in written form or verbally said
was happy that everyone in her neighborhood got along
the first thing you could do is learn
first the reason why i say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do
computers also help us learn
if someone finds it offensive then they should quite simply not read it
if people want to read a certain magazine or book that offends a large sum of people then they should go somewhere besides a library to find it
this shows that someone is hurt by what has happened amplifying the story
we can learn about different places in the world
the heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive
traffic came to a standstill
there are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands
i know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer
this is just a way to protect the minds of young ones which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up
these are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used
those are my details to support my reason
or simply if a friend cant get a ride to another friends house they on still talk on the computer
in the center there is a carpet
now most to all should know that there are children sections in most if not all libraries
there are the reasons for why i believe you should go for the cause of computers
what one person loves another hate
it sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she or he fails the first time
they can help find long lost friend and keep in contact with them
if he chooses not to that is up to
he started getting a little doubtful with himself as well that wont help much with bringing success of the trip
with them we can talk to others from far away and fast
censor them from your children and do not get them censored from the whole world
computers also allow us to learn about far away people and places
the truth is we can not stop them their is so much of the pornography and bad music out in this world that your can get it anywhere
this means that the test was very important to her with the of pressure to pass and of a new is ready to pass the test
you need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature
while my mother was fine with me watching the movie some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate
they have to tie white ribbon also
should there be censorship in libraries
the setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist
the desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function
finally people have the ability to type on a program if they wanted to type a letter or story
she recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange
i hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society
they even allow people to talk online
the horse came and ran in a circle
taking music in my opinion would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music
yet again our next and final issue
it gave me a gigantic
in this memoir of the author creates a clear mood
so many are kidnapped because online chatting
are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons
censorship in libraries and media should be abolished
because it will help everyone learned about new things
there can also be language that the kids should not read
they could put in it in the back and whoever wants it and go ask for it
this way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian
is right we can also be aware of the environment
people like this are more likely to gain weight have little social time and spend too much time inside
because of these offensive things there is often censorship in public places
another opportunity that could be helpful on a computer is the ability to interact with other people
another thing computers allow us to do is check the news
the definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please
if someone is searching for a book of that kind they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure
they are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible
in my own experience my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part
so in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source so the cyclist is being affected by all of this
see now you heard it from the expert as well
make sure they see something fun but with a positive message
computer are like a giant resource of information
besides if you want my honest opinion computers should only be used as tools
i look at a computer and think of progress
it is a way to connect with faraway friends
ten minutes becomes one hour in a snap
if we removed everything that was offensive today
for example when he hit the ghost town he just laughed
either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used
the speed limit was and he was going so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps
i mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries
she previously had a lot of home sickness missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood
computers are a serious issue
also gives the change to talk to people with webcams
all one has to do is find a site such as type there question and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem
if your tired of being home then just go on the internet
this is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased
however i also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students
the computer are the best system for go online every body use computer
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story do not exceed posted speed limit in many ways
by banning a book in a school library a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think
being a teenager myself i have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material
another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer
the feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids friends and family
you newspaper staff use a computer to type the news
if a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life
another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because hes pretty much dehydrated
some people have family in other countries that they have not seen in a long time and with a computer you can talk to them
without air our planet would be lifeless
i know for your company having no computer would be a nightmare
i think that computers have a positive affect on people
now if a gory or a book with lots of blood in it then it should stay on the shelves
i have to you like and that why we send every one of them to school of every year
for example if a veteran told a story about what happened in a certain area the history book could tell a completely different story
i think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images
the effects on the computer puts on us can vary
the inner planets mercury venus earth and mars are highly dense and rocky
they could do this by not letting children leave their parents side
and thank you for having time to read this
computers makes peoples lives just so much simpler
rated movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games
therefore computers are good
some people do not have the money to buy books or internet so these people rely on public libraries
he wrote about his great home and family
not everyone likes the same things
this discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging
dear i am and i have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries
i say if you do not like it do not look at it it is simple as that
library books offensive
when the part we live faces the sun it is daytime for us
and third we are losing the ability to communicate with the people around us
some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free
although there are many new methods of communication nowadays the post office is still very important
i can relate with cousins in and in
books are one of the most important things that we have in world
this is what we are putting into our movies and books and magazines and putting into the children of heads
people getting caught up on the or people not having enough money to explore the world so they just be on the
the next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water
also people need to remember that this is a free country and everyone has freedom of speech
who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves
also if your parents found out you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded

but if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them
not everyone can be happy but everyone can be appropriate
you could not the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show so there could be no possible abstract art
moreover the children were bound to destroy these things in no time
the next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself
many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism
also we need to help our environment
shows that loves his families cooking and his own
that would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands
in third grade i took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover
i trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people
you can type a paper or news article on the computer
many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals
other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off
for some reason computers had a lot of effects on people
for example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run
dear editor have you ever used a computer
the only thing that i believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos
he talks about how thankful he is to have such a good family and that he can call his home a home
here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines
this helps develop skills later on such as problem solving
also has spell check you could email it to someone or even change the font color size of the font and much more
loved him and they elected him as their president
of all she can have the right to do that but there is people who have a say in this
to begin with the learning ability people get from it has improved
take a chance and fight for what you believe in and vote for censored books
dear of the daily i am writing you to address the issue of computers in our society today
lastly all of paragraph and explains how his parents risked everything to be in the
we have the internet that lets people upload book and music to share
everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read
skills are things you need to have if you want to pursue a career
have you ever wanted to play outside but it was raining or your friends were not around
all i can do is hope you publish my letter so everyone can see my point of view make their own decisions
there are games with virtual worlds or games that are fun and have no meaning
its good to still have have books that are offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive
lastly if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes
it would be unfair to those people and if we are unfair to them we have to be unfair to everybody
allowing our culture to become way can lead to various sorts of problems as we have seen all to well
they help many people in different ways like the teachers students scientists and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life
once again books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them
my second reason is that even though computers are often thought of as destroying can build social lives
some of us like to buy or sell things on the computer or do our homework
a computer can store what you learn too
she finds new hope after buying the plant and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about
there was always a strong sense of family and the house too
instead of separating the kids surprisingly they started quarreling amongst themselves
people face obstacles all the time
we can borrow one book at a time from the school library
life would be much slower without a computer to speed things up
another thing that is somewhat related to this
with more people making use of computers will be the more technology benefits our society
the more you hid it the more children will seek it out
censoring is not going to change our society
some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer
dear you imagine a world where technology controls human interaction
for one the helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them
computers are taking over our life
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
as someone once said who do not know their history are bound to repeat it
taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples knowledge of our world
their effect is the most positive effect on people ever in my opinion
most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting
parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds
it is where the author is trying to show to the reader
if we start controlling each others thoughts feelings and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding
a library is a place for everyone
computers help advance research help people reconnect with one another and help the communicate who knows that computers will help us accomplish next
he had been very tired
computers can be very useful to people
as well as pictures blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it
i feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books magazines or
everyone needs exercise
for example rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
this vary for it depends on age and the way the reader will understand the content of the books
if she believes in herself shell be able to get situated in this new place
since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it
you get upset when you read something for the first time and not notice that it could help you when you think about it
he would have had all of the grape juice he wanted but it was abandoned
well if so that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper the old fashioned way
i think that the advances of technology to the computer are great and more beneficial than bad
if people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs
i think many people believe him to be a bit too wild and deranged to be a convincing argument
the three most important moods where grateful loving and happy
i reach school at eight in the morning and attend my classes
but nothing that i found offensive personally
not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions
i find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair
all these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store
books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago morals were different a while ago from what they are now
because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test
another problem that computers give you is being non social
libraries have sections for all ages
so why would we want to take them away
technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way
also if you were to want to order some things such as shoes clothes perfume fragrances lotions and some even order house hold things if needed
there are a lot of disadvantages to computers
we are also taking away books that interest a child
everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out
in the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways
next some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people
all new ways to communicate with people
i believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things
on a computer you can do many things to never get bored
also you can forget the steps of how to do something on your project or homework so you check online
censorship in libraries will always be changing
who knows we might have to vote on it someday
as you know forest are being chopped down and pollution is destroying our world
young adults in school also got used to texting
it is not being effective most times
also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town
it gives them short cuts through life
ore and more people use computers but this is not necessarily a good thing
through a recent study out of families in say they have relatives that are far away
in the memoir the author creates a mood that is calm and comfortable
so then i completed project and headed it in to teacher
now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to
in the story it says the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush resulting in a bad grade
should public libraries have to censor some of the books movies and music they have on display
the reason for this is so she will have time to adjust
the only way they communicate is through online chat
think i organize my ideas as much present them clearly
at peak hours there is a mad rush
as you can see there reasons why i am concerned about people spending time on the computer
would you be okay with kids not having the option typing their homework
anyone can use the library and it is a valuable resource to many people
i professionals say that of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false
next time feel the urge to update your status with something like got home call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead
i think there is also an issue with computers
she is going to build up and change in time for the retake of the test its like a rebirth in a way
my aunt and uncle live in and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy
and now twenty miles into his journey the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply
this shows that the test she look had to do with spring and the budding of flowers and that she is trying to grow something
and it is a lot more fun to learn of off a computer than a book
i remember when i was about i went to a hotel in with family and a family friend
the weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable
should libraries remove offensive reading material
he also had pretty much ran out of water
computers teach hand eye coordination give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to socialize online
people who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law rather than people who are against it
help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics
adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries reading materials
one great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others
i do not want to be the same as everybody else
magazines are a different subject
they turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying
other than winding you down on a rough day at work on the computer allow you to communicate with friends and family
to start off computers and other technology make life easier
all it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf
these themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love
some people are easily offended and some are not
each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in
that is why computers are needed
you can to other people that are or you can just on some websites such as and tons more
he had to save as much water as possible
he never used a computer
obviously however there are certain exceptions
the books magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves
first just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high
finally computers keep the brain active
dear i believe that computers take away from our lives in a negative way
i do not like appearing in examinations as they suck my blood
in almost everyday school rely on the internet to gain information stated education secretary
although certain materials are not meant for children to see adults find it enjoyable and interesting
i think the answer is yes as long as it offends more than a few people
there are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas at times people will disagree
picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too to find that their child has been bullied to death it really hurts them
this feeling of graciousness tells about the love and sacrifice he feels his parents went through for him
keeping in contact with important people or your friends is a good thing
i just think the memoir sets a happy mood
it infringes our rights
they also are a great way to yourself
children now days see more and know more what they are not suppose to know for an example cursing
everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into
have you ever read a book half way through and questioned why you are reading it
everybody all over the world knows that the favorite food of the cat is the rat
however personally i feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people
might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him
i think that people need to step away from the computer desk get good grades avoid bullying and criminals
i believe books should be censored by content much like movies
this shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family
libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines
most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences
the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader
computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society
if someone finds something particularly offensive i believe they just should not view it
this is why i think that people are spending ton much time on computers
so he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing
computers help people to make wrong choices and there is no doubt people should let up on the time they spend on the internet
there were a set of called the which pretty much was a list of to treat as unfairly as possible
she yelled us and said i would have thought your parents raised you better than that
when the cyclist is biking it is very hot he says in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees
in addition computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people
if you think that books are that offensive try walking down the hallways
i know that books help me figure out many things
family and friends are huge parts of our life
also you can get very fat
so many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions
the computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person
so they can play games with people from around the world using a computer
why cant it be in a library
in fourth grade girls are required to watch a video on the topic of puberty and in fifth grade many girls begin to go through these changes themselves
if libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read listen and watch what they wanted
one reason why i think there should be censorship is because of minors that want to see things that not be suitable for them
i think that you should have a positive way on computers too
he describes in good detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him
dear newspaper editor you have a computer at home
in the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive
get into a fun conversation or debate
these online pages causes people to go on one to connect to their friends
it is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of hours of their free time on a computer
have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on
some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing
aforementioned obesity is issue
that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
many other people also come running
turn off the television if the program bothers you
however noticing your kid being on the computer is not a good thing
in my opinion i do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves
another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind
also books give a message about how times use to be
if a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them
hibiscus is everything far her
they also are incredibly out of shape
i mean computers help people learn how to use there eyes and hands t the same time
this light helps us to study at night
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important
they might think that it takes away time from nature friends and family
sometimes life can be so cool
in the olden day’s people were not civilized they lived in rock caves and on huge trees
but i think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both her old and new life
i agree with the statement of in some degree
are very well liked by many of people so why get rid of them for those few who get offended
dear i am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people
another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him
this book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship
is this good for people is what there doing affecting there health and physical activity
people would be even more offended than before in that case
finally you can order stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store and the things you might order you can play with outside
if so then get up and go have fun
and he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear
the author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again
maybe some others do like them and like to read them
many libraries in the world have censoring on their materials
it allows you to from your home
the most important of the factors in the matter of survival is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches
everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care not hatred
the cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way
in my opinion i think that computers are a good thing
a book is a form of speech
they even became your new best friend
in a public library many children who the books are censored for are with their parents
had his dad come get him from the party
this would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty
everything around her is different and new
she says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home
and if you take it away they never find it
i think the future will be based everything on computers
we have even reached the moon and left our
the author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note
the author has a sentimental value to
next you should post this out on you news paper
fresh air is very important for us
either way with the book left on the shelf or taken off it is still going to be a problem with name calling
hardly anyone would and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom
though troubling he still had the confidence that he could continue
i think that computers are not as good as some people think
the computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous
lastly i have to say computers are just fun to use
the spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming the geese return and the snow has melted
the cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all
i do not believe books or any other form of art should be removed from the shelves of libraries
libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults
plus nature and the fact of being outside inspire you to continue a diet or begin one seeing how healthy and perfect the outdoor can be
most have holy books and writings
for libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights has stood for
instead of reading on the computer read a novel you can ask your parents to drive you to the library
the mood of the cooking family coming together and of the cheerful music is just great
in exercising while making on
times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids you can start a pick of game of baseball
we still got to talk and have a nice conversation
so my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit
there would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in
this is final reason why i was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer
the older sister is to busy looking for her own book
they put to many things they should not in kids movies
there are some people who are on the computer all day
who is to label a book offensive
because of this he ends up lose and acne
imagine not eating sleeping and walking around for a day
there is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer
with all this new quicker stuff you can talk to friend when ever you want
computers are very helpful when it comes to learning
i can think of many books that could be taken offensively that are still on many school library and public library shelves
when people spend less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice
everyone will have there own views about a book music movies or magazines
there are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored
books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them
the writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences
computers are easy to access and you interact with loved ones friends or new people
all you have to do is manage your time
you can talk to your friend on there so they on being social
this websites help take your mind off a bad day
computer give people the ability to learn about places faraway
all types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries
who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends
this will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home
if you ask anyone in school they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool
computers offer another way to learn things about the world
my second reason is kids might have to look important things up
there are good things about computers but the less time you spend on them the better it is for everyone
let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility
then you have to get a new computer and everything all
the lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize
the old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again
my body was years old
the more smart you become overall
he is clever at studies
all you do is type a subject to
you need to be healthy and most of all active
secondly the computer helps you communicate to friends and family for in the world
as the cyclist prepares to retire for the day he takes particular note of the serenity of an early summer evening and ends the day feeling calm
i have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else
as i said these books magazines music etc
if you do not like the book do not have to get the book
they have lots of websites for games
whether people admit it or not they have ran into at least one book that has offended them
also being on all of these websites and more try to give you things
he says his parent were selfless and took in refugees in their home
i do not really read books
it makes people think in different ways
you would not be too happy about it
and that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of
so in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could
i got in trouble by saying it just because i heard that stupid word that i wished never heard
it is a harsh scream that could frighten you in the jungle
therefore the features of the setting affect the cyclist
it changes from flat road to short rolling hills
with computers you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker
one that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot and that the terrain was very rough in the desert
computers are very popular these days
in conclusion censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature
sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader but in other cases the reader be offended
one way i could describe the memoir is that it makes you fell good about things
it will create a more civil trip to the library
but people making it more addicting by creating things such as never ending games and its distracting people from there life family work and exercise
anything from to to country and back can be
remember that they are very good places to go to for information to get books or just to go somewhere quite
that one thing being pieces of are taken away because of their offensiveness
the setting affected the cyclist due to the changes in terrain
that not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone
we all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations
mood is a feeling displayed to the reader through literature
i know you certainly will agree
it eases your mind to be absorbed in something
for all we know a book censored could have saved millions of lives
a lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day
well this pretty much sums up what i think about library contents being censured
its almost like rewriting history
dear newspaper i think computers are great
no one world like a child who is bent on harming others
these part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect
compared to real life and nature there really is no comparison
parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries
people have opinions and that is one hundred percent okay
they show a persons opinion on something
people reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others
do you see all people computers looking up facts about things as going on the computers learning
some ask what a library is well they are good places to go
they complete their homework
computers affect all of these areas of our lives
this technology is the most best thing you could ever use
the cyclist was given very old directions
this means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it
computers have a positive effect on people
computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge
most magazines that are being sold today is giving children the wrong idea
i think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for
some items can be offensive to some but not others
in this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity
you save green and are green
for one information and knowledge are at your fingertips
he describes how hard it is growing up in a racist time and how the real meaning of family is changed through different points of view
my dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me
he learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum
all of paragraph is about how grateful he is to his parents
are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body
it is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio
it is necessary to enter the medical college and follow clinical medicine
also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town
as the author of the story goes on her bike trip the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming
in all of people agree with my idea about computers
if they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song then why not let them
thanks to computers there is a great chance students receive a passing grade
instead of leaving home they can be cooking doing yoga or speaking a new language all from their computer at home
computers can do many things like play game listen to music watch videos and chat with your friends
what about the other percentage
children are going to end up hearing bad words seeing inappropriate things and reading offensive passages in books or magazines
any thing could happen at any time with your computer of no where it could just die and not work and of your data will be gone forever
censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love
while computers are fun and useful could they have a negative effect on society
libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change
i rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face
the reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home but they are not the real thing
i strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped
finally it allows people to talk online with other people
there are many books music movies and magazines that people find offensive
i also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead clean and neat
they will they fall into a depression
she is on a journey and no one can touch her
this was affecting the cyclist because he was tired hot and getting dehydrated
not only does a computer teach me about current events it also helps me in my daily life
however since the price of computers decreased purchase have stimulating
or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read
also the snow represents a blanked of the past hard times
computers provide easy interaction without breakups they make it easier to learn and if you are smart then they are safe
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
but she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope
the weather being so hot and humid did not help the cyclist throughout his journey
we should not waste electricity because resources to make electricity are scarce and will not last forever
so take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding
people who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant for free
if you have family near you then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another
one way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water
also you can use it for researching purposes
about what society would be like
although there is much good items in a library there is also bad or offensive items in a library as well
he explained a little about his parents when the first came here to
before my uncle went to he wanted to learn about their culture
this made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water
even though some moods are good and some are bad
there is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing
children should not be shelter at a young age to just young adult things because they need to know what else is out there in the world
i think that knowing that everyone is different and special in their own way should show that everyone is going to enjoy different things at different levels
that could cause them not to like white people
i think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children
more and more people use the computer
i did stupid stuff because i thought that it was right
now more than ever people are becoming very obese
we cannot let this continue
the topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years
have you ever think about why teenagers are changing each day
so i decided to look up the way to find the answer and it caught me up with the class again
so being able to talk to friends online is one example why i for computers
my many local in the town of
computers can be time consuming
for someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom
that is why it was smart to end the story like they ended it
you could interpret it in different ways
this will help the kids that play baseball
whether it is because it helps people get their work done
if you run out of energy while cycling you have nothing
this can affect the cyclists will to keep pedaling and if they have no determination the cyclist will not go anywhere
instead of making a really big poster board for project i made a power point instead that was so much easier
it is just a way to make learning fun for young kids
censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing
therefore the advances in technology are having a negative affect on society
most importantly you use the computer for school work
now those are some reasons on why i feel that computers are a great part of our lives
just to have a chance at a new and better life
everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions
the prides itself on that children are the future well why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read
classical rock and blues are some examples
these are all good examples of why computers have a positive impact on the human race
she referred to the plant as yet another old friend
the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail
new times the wall street have moved their news mainly to the internet allowing people across the to see them
however much some dislike the thought of this much freedom we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some
yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself
people need computers to do research
also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on over and down rough terrain
computers can also entertain you
i think having books that are too offensive should be put in there own bookshelves
a holiday is free time and it should be spent in this spirit only
second of all is that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places
i hope you agree with me when i say computers are bad
it gets shipped to our house in less than a week
this again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death and not be able to make it
sure they can mail it out but that would take forever for people to find out about it and learn about it
and let me tell you there is no restarting after that
in the beginning it says of loss so deep and at the end it says i will take that test again
they find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book
so the next time you see something that is offensive just put it back and move on
some students in the classroom at the time called and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife
he took some taste of it
the mood created by the author in the memoir
without computers communication between others would be very hard
the setting was also really hot so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going
computers can also keep you in from outside to get fresh air and sunlight
he is my class fellow
when seeing and hearing things children start to believe it
you can also go to school online
“simple life” saysthe prophet mohammed “set my heart on high thoughts”
so even know you can communicate with your friends
lastly computers increase your skills when it comes to technology
a certain area designated for certain genres
on a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends
now imagine this your sitting in front of a computer in a hot stuffy room
about ninety percent of the workers use the computer to do their jobs
i feel offensive when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves
you can do things like learn socialize and actually become healthy
also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal
that is why she bought the flowers
someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought i have when reading a scary book
this style of communication has ever a new type of bullying
however these are three things the computer does very well
they left the place they were most in for him
this program lets students view the interesting way world cultures in videos
the computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home
but the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now
the technology of computers has brought education to new
says look i was only kidding with the girl she needs to learn how to take a joke
have you ever wandered about current events in our country or others
this represents how happiness transpires throughout their home and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be
obesity is not a hard thing to get rid of
computer is something people use to talk to people and keep in contact
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
to begin with seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate on the computer there is many ways
in addition a big factor of and is music
she was bright but shy and used books as her friends
if you want kids to know about the history of our country they need to know what actually happened
and education are essential especially now the more you learn the better salary you get
if people find the books in the offensive they do not have to go
that quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life
the author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change
those computers can help us with anything
he read the passage and his eyes went wide
parents as well will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material
dear local newspaper i do agree that computers have impacted human society greatly
during summers he grows rice cotton and jute
its also showing her ability to conquer obstacles
censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method
firstly computers help teach hand eye coordination
you can find worse hear worse just by walking down the street just about anywhere
for many kids no matter what age they only rent books from a library for two main reasons pleasure and projects
things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them
he cultivates rice is the main food of
his parents quit their jobs and came over all for him
sometimes people save money because they buy something online a sale than going to a store and paying anymore money
reported that of its million users million users have friends that live in a different country
many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete
he portrays a mood that shows you can be happy no matter what the hardships you endure
computers also have their flaws
children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library
you want kids to be over weight like i was
i hope you agree with me
the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert considering it was so hot
i strongly feel that every book was created for people to read and gain knowledge on what every aspect of what the book is
like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else
a is great way to bring your reading up
television will block out things such as language nudity alcohol drugs and things of that nature
i think a decent amount of time on the computer you can benefit from
also give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement
that is not what needs
my class room is in the second floor
the things that remind her of home
they can have different sections such as adult children and young adult
he writes that in a way which could make the reader feel that he is extremely happy
for example flat roads was replaced by short rolling hills
everything is a personal opinion
you can also put all your information online and you not think a lot of when they really do
people should have the right to read watch or listen to anything they want uncensored
no one likes boring people and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination
by taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there that the world is perfect and there is no wrong
just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do
anything you can get on any other technologies
many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them
for example if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet
if stores take away these items that it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice
i have a friend name and she is a computer addict
it is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college
oh well all i can tell you is that your missing a lot
i carried a bag and went to school with my father
the people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material
the material we read in books are sometimes offensive
the products should stay on the shelves so that the people who need or just want to use the products can use the products
this shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough
books are most commonly used in the library
i know people say that where you are on be computer you spend less time exercising but the computers help you with you throwing skills
it keeps you and healthy
thus they make this world a better place to live in
the words in songs can be offensive
then she would say well was the one who watched the movie
no matter how gruesome or vile of a description a book can give it still does not compare with the visual picture of a video
he thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart
you would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this
not even curse words
well i know it would me if it was are wedding song
even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress in fact have a stress issue due to computers
have fresh healthy eyes and get away the computer
your no enjoying nature
are many different web sites to go on and talk to friends and family
a school cannot function smoothly without discipline
not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves offended parties can just simply avoid the book
chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults
their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason
after dinner my father tells me stories
i do agree with you on one thing
well first of all why do we even want to watch see or listen to things that are not right
dear newspaper percents of jobs day use computers
first it started off with the large hills he had to ride up making him work harder and tire himself out quickly
long distance friends can view photos information videos and chat from far away
the last reason for censorship is it keeps people interested
he picked out spoke on horizon and rode to them makes his way across the desert
confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut
for example in fifth grade i did a research project on
saying that the material is unsuitable for a younger age group is correct but at that age the children should be with adult when checking out books anyway
he also provides us with sugarcane cabbage cauliflower beans and many other vegetables and grains
here he describes how the people in his neighborhood acted towards each other
friends family and exchange students are able to talk and see you through video chat
suddenly spoke and said are people so cruel
maybe even just a fun computer game is nice
we entered our compartment
taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else
spring is the sign of life and birth or renewal
computers are great technology but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives
all you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision
on the whole i feel society would be better off without computers
do you want to be overweight and not be in shape
were you ever given a school project to do but no book has the information you want
computers are becoming more advanced everyday almost everyone owned or owns a computer
so i returned the book to the library
this makes life easier for many people
time is a very important factor for us
lets say i was in the library and i did see something offensive
secondly you can talk to your family members and friends on the internet
and discipline among the members of the society is of the greatest value
we can learn about many cultures with it
dear news computers are a great machine to use
which would you rather do type or pages
the author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time
to conclude debate on censorship plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship
by many i mean millions
every has the choice of what they pick up and listen to or read
it can get very hot therelike the writer describes wide rings of sweat circled my shirt
they make research easier and faster to find
i remember one time a few years ago
after that they can not tell you to get off of it unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate
a different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though
people use messaging and its also a way getting connected to others
i think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library
other experts disagree
they can also help us keep in touch with our loved ones
the mood created by the author was a warm and comforting feeling
but some do not think that the libraries should be putting stuff there if they are not going to let any one touch it or check it out
students love having access with information around the world
in certain department stores there be a movie that has a line in it that i take offensively
for instance most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world
also the books and movies for adults are different than children books and movies
that is how computers let people stay in touch
if some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them
the cyclist said that this sight was troubling
also think of the handwriting factor
another one is about special needs movie or book that have to deal with people putting down others that have special problems
it allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in
being social is one of the most important parts of life
the music and movie section should stay in libraries
flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on
there are more books in the library you can read
popular sites like and so on make a good way to keep in touch with friends from your past or even make new ones
however if we did not remove anything that was offensive serious issues could occur
people lose jobs over computers
it allows you to start a new life without leaving your room
libraries have people that come in and out of the library everyday
they were always having guests and loved a lot of people and considered them family
i show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis
considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast
so who are we supposed to believe
people should be aware of their world in which they live
computer are just another reason why
that is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment
anybody ever think of that
the spring season will come and new life will be provided to all
that is just insane that you would want to wast that money after being payed for
furthermore if i needed is contact friends i just them rather than speaking in person
do you think it matters how appropriate they are
computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide
he organized a campaign to get his country free from the british
discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day
there was a great rush at the stop
i always missed the tennis ball in matches
there was no one in sight not a building car or structures of any kind
their material provides research and appropriate entertainment for all ages
these are pieces of evidence that describe the mood of the memoir
some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends
if the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines then yes they can feel offensive about the things inside the magazine or books
if someone sits at their computer all day eating the food is not being worked off so it all turn to fat
his parents helped him and gave him hope
a song can a as much as it can take one away
also you can talk with friends and family on computers
there is so much guidance for our daily lines through computers
he was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few tantalizing sips
watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it
you bear of people using computers to do work all of the time
lastly i believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on
last the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race
wonder how he was going to survive
our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the and now we have a that protects all our information
i have to say that i agree with them
the goat and the lion lived in peace together
appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a home
i could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is
the mood of the memoir is appreciation
the library is not liable for the feelings of the readers
have your old teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country
usually computers can do much more good than bad and can make a persons life much easier
how do you cook an exquisite meal
in conclusion computers do have a great effect on people
science also benefits from computers
along with all that though it gives love an copy
the risk of any of these things happening is very high
when it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them
lots of people come to the library to check out books music movies and other things for entertainment
he also knows how to dress and heal wounds
tell them or let them read the books you always censor at the libraries so that they know
i and my youngest sister remain at home some fear
take for example a child that is six years old and can do whatever he or she wants
online chat especially has an effect on most people because were trading in a fun day for one where we just talk online and back internet
all these things are comfort for some people
having computers will help raise a students grades and help them have a more successful life in the future
thank you for your time
it is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech
man’s conquests over nature tell us about his great powers of mind
so i think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things mite change
a lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier
they are used for carrying loads
of people learned a dictionary there own using the internet
when i was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program i attended
after finding a place to get a drink he stated i had an overwhelming and buy some bait showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water
there are some downsides to having computer in the house
do you think the adolescence would want to waste paper because their messy handwriting and mistakes
store things on them and use them for entertainment
they carry her in their arms like a puppy as she is lighter and softer to handle
i know that if i was having trouble with sports for a long time i would give up
readers imagine a world without computer
i believe that the book that none of us read
because you can learn it easier with different under standing it better so you
when we meet up catch
to whom this concern i heard that people are having a debate to tell whether computers benefit us or are bad for us
so you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson
knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped
so the mood in the memoir was love towards his parents
always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make
materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material but they were created for a reason
i would we need computer for many things for example we need computer for communications we also need them to educate yourself and others
so what else did they say
lastly you can even look up people on the internet
books provide facts and more reliable information than what you can hear from people
no matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn
in a culture like the one we have censorship usually takes the back seat
if i could pick what to do i would keep the books on the shelves and make the kid happy
the last kind of books i think is offensive is books because they are hard to read them in
the content has a right to be there
when finding this building to be abandoned and all things juice anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up
books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world
i doubt it could get any worse and so does the cyclist
because some of our friends and family have either did or attempted suicide and without knowing about it how can it be prevented
offensive materials impact everyday life for better and worse
you use a webcam and talk to anyone you want
if someone came across that in a book it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book
all they want to do is go on the computer
a waste of money has been put into buying it restoring it once and now restoring it a second time
this is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature
the farmer is an able person
the reason i think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland
before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it
hopefully now you have a better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is
even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world
these are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library
yesterday i reached the bus stop a little earlier than usual
some say that books magazines movies etc
kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easy and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble
so for that they always kept their arms and door wide open to people they considered family
it usually does it in the morning when the first rays of the sun appear
i think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test
is one reason why i think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature
in our school we are taught about the risks of computers and how to prevent any possible
dear local newspaper too much technology
i almost screamed with excitement when my father showed me huge planes near the runway
also of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework
my father wanted me to join a school
being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do
there are just too many things that can be taken offensively
after all the world is a very diverse place and we were not all made the same
drinking and other evil habits
we have to chop so many trees down just to get paper to each kid in the grade
generally this is not the case
all arrangements had been made
i have and i think that it is a wonderful resource
so essentially by censoring works in libraries we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be
every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness
if books are being taken of shelves based on a few people opinions then their rights are being infringed upon by the people who deemed it inappropriate
a life with out computers is a lot harder to do things that we cant make simpler with computers
so explain in your next article that we need our computers
the computer also teaches you how to do different stuff
so in the end they have mad a home and a relationship together and with other people
a camel is a very useful animal
it also makes it easier to find health insurance car insurance and house insurance
this affected him because he was already dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated
sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face
having computer allows that family to chat an easy way to keep in contact talk with each other
out of people keep in touch with family or friends online
at one point he says the sun was beginning to beat down but i barely noticed
and if you are connected to the internet you can play games with other people around the world
the she means that she is determined to live up to her past and get through it
then there is the man much torture
the middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home
on the computer you can find almost any game you want to play
if this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing
the geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in which she misses very much
the second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play
people can read or watch whatever they want
second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world the world
that would be a horrible experience for a young child to have
for example if you are in school and you are deciding what college that you should go try the a great place that you can go to get information
of course a computer can be helpful
by stressing this warmth it meant that it created memories
in the field of medicine and surgery science has made wonderful progress
there are scary books like
but who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer
would you learn better with a visual in front of you
it teaches better than books
for we are all the same but yet still broken up among looks and culture
she came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain
that is my last reason my opinion is what it is
this shows that no matter what will his parents
we need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through
we as people need knowledge
there are infinite numbers of information in the world and computers help find it
if someone reads something and it offends them they can go do something else
you work out your arms your legs
for example many books talk about drugs and smoking
i remember when my friend moved to
when he finds the bait shop hes relieved
such as the rated movies or books that are inappropriate for young children
others like the violence in those shows
some of you who are reading this would say yes but why
they are the test of cramming not of knowledge
when this memoir is read the mood of love is expressed
do you want to be unhealthy in life if not go outside and take a walk
today computers are like the worlds biggest book of knowledge
she probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world
there was no one in sight not a building car or a structure of any kind
having an adult only section would be a way to solve this problem
the major thing that effects him is the lack of water
finally it shows that the mood is happy and grateful because it says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice
when he talked about the different cultures and races coming together and becoming a solidarity made the feel welcome to everyone no matter what race you are
the issue that is going around is computers have good effects on people or bad ones
therefore they are getting barely any work done
we will not going to get reed of the books music movies magazines or anything else that we the library has
but to some more than others
which means the whole community can go pick out something
so maybe things do need to be taken off shelves
there is not much that can be helped with that
i knew that when i was old enough to read those novels they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me
but you can educate someone about the subject matter
but if the libraries have censored content in the library then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content
now some people would have been very offended by this book because the were calling the all those names that the do not like to be called
the possibilities are endless
by taking certain books music movies or magazines off the shelves we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow
now head on over to your library and pick up a book about something you would like to no more about
that is my reasons i think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen
or you can go on gaming sources and interact with other people
secondly people should play with real people
these materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned
as you can see this is my third and final reason as to why i believe computers are positive
dear and of the i think that computers are a good thing to use
people will never leave the house and instead they are on their computer
the terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut
i believe there should be a national rating system for books like there is in the movie industry
thanks to internet i have been able to keep in touch with them
primary class children were playing with boats in the pool which serves our center court
he is very helpful to all
the idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated
second i think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn about far away places that you have never been to before
a recent polls shows that that average person from ages spreads over two hours on the computer each day
is a computer going to benefit society or will they have catastrophic results
they also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking in a library
then i realize that i was making mistakes
for example instead of a ton of papers you could simple just save it in your computer
this will help in every day lives to to play catch with your son or to pick something up it is very important
going to the library is a pain
i love taking hikes with my family up a
the easiest way of this was talking over
finally the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp
my whole point of explaining this is that its the peoples choice they would like to be on all the time
to whom it concern i believe that computers benefit society
clearly the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members
computers almost makes anything possible
dear a computer is a benefit
movies guidelines are along the same pattern
while you are on the internet you can go to learning websites
interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away
s i think we are not
after a couple more miles he comes to small fork with a pump
these pads help him in walking or running on the sand
if they took them away not only will people files fall but everyone will be disorganized in the bong run
most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions
thus if he ever reaches the next town
but we both gained something by reading the book
the author sends a message to her readers when one leaves what they once had
steal from you and worse
the features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist
what does everyone else think though
the setting in the story do not exceed posted speed limit reflect upon the cyclist
a benefit is bicycles are much lighter and allow roads to last much longer than with heavy vehicle traffic
will never forget the house because it is where learned the real definition of family
that that the author did not care that much about house looks price or its location
no matter where people go they can find something that could offend someone
despair is writ large on their faces
along with the hibiscus it also shows that the geese and the melting of the snow represent a fresh start and a new beginning
she should be strong and follow the flow of life
maintenance of law is his duty
yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to or visit in person
there are many different ways of looking at life and many different opinions
computers televisions and radios have made life more pleasant
it also has many games that and learn our vocab words
the world has changed and books should too
every morning we should wish our elders
that would be a waste of time and money
first the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot making it hard to pedal
my first reason being socialization
when he pumped the water no come out
if they watch a movie full of violence they feel it is their job to act in violent manners
this shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer you realize that typing becomes easier
we cant hide from the world
the computer could teach babies how to talk
he always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people
another thing is there are online courses now for students
i believe that this is one main reasons of obesity
the scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every shack or building he comes across for water
or you could ask yourself what does it really solve
they might start it lost minute
he is strict with those who break discipline
as a conclusion the basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones
i feel that books music movies and magazines should not be removed from shelves
he admired his parents and what they did
so this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or group of people find offensive
it helps complete a number of tasks
we citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in libraries the should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want
and so what its their time and they want to spend it on the computer
this is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time
you gain typing skills hand eye coordination and mouse skills
my other reason to you why people use websites is for messaging
on one side parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries
not everything should be hidden
due to lack of water this feature really affects the cyclist
the gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information
you might need the computer to search up things for a project
my second opinion on computer is that
computers are sometimes the easy way out
our connection with nature was strong
by censoring something as small as books movies and so on i think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens
i believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries
no matter who they were and who their friends were we all are different
i think that learning how to type is an excellent thing
there should be restrictions against offensive materials
the route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water
some people would say that people spend too much time on computers
not in the house on the computer
if people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display they should not even pick it up to begin with
computers are going to be around for a long time and when they die down it will only be because something better came along
considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water
you could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone
no one puts a gun to our head and says this book or you will die
computers can do amazing things
it reflected his own desperate situation all refreshments in the past there was nothing left
also they can read anything they want too because they can buy the book and read it and hid it
lastly might nit be active but live playing or going other online websites
you can also learn all you need to know on computers
reading different types of literature a terrific way of learning and library shelves should be stripped of the books occupying the space
the freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want
i know that most people in was spend all the time with there family
over all the setting caused the cyclist major problems physically and mentally
stop waiting and get online or go out and buy one
if you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it
people learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters
this statement represents adjusting to change
second enjoying nature is a good thing to do instead of playing with a computer because you get your daily dose of air by enjoying nature
obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience
there are hundreds of websites that will let you watch it for free
can cause you to and cheap
i am find out what weather is today what happens throughout the day that be shocking to everyone and find out about celebrities
then he said over the long crippling hill a building came into view
i think people should not use computers
they deserve more attention than a machine
there is hardly any disease
the forerunner was moving at a tremendous speed
movies have a protection against this called ratings
a while later the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings
not everyone is interested in the same book genre
she even says but its strong enough to make it through the cold months
instead of using you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball
just imagine more people outside and healthy
i play lots of sports and i love them all
my first reason is to look up information on the computer
books movies plays games magazines all things of that sort are for our entertainment
you need a good grade on a project
the author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them
this is a very interesting question
people go to the library because they want to either get away or just to be free and grab a nice book
so when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out
bulls and cows help them to get a good harvest
nature is beautiful smells nice even refreshing at times
all in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material
i listen to a lot of music when i drive to school and most of it is rap music
they cannot shove information down our throats
anyone is capable of possessing them
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
the author described the love of his family throughout this memoir and his friends also
not only is the computer dad for your healthy
this gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic
but then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight
websites are invented on the main idea of communicating
the concluding paragraph in the story winter hibiscus portrays the powerful massage of change from a cold distant failure to adapt to a new life
secondly having a computer will teach you better social skills
computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers
students be dancing to their favorite song
using a computer can also more life easier
if kids or parents are offended by these types of books then they do not need to check them out
some books might be to explicit for a child to read
he is very helpful to all
as i anxiously started reading my book i found language drug abuse and sexual content
i do not believe that is very offensive at all
critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities
i think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home
imagine sitting at the computer completing every assignment and doing every homework there is
develops a grateful comforting caring mood
although some experts want people to use computers less that technology is required in schools
if you think a subject might be offensive for you you should not read it
dear would life effect you if you did not have a computer
dear local newspaper the effects computers have an people are not good
the hot sun beamed down on the cyclist
while traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert
you can instantly talk to people and catch up with them
you can buy many things on the internet the clothes on food
there is just so many things that the computer can help us with
he does not spend sleepless and restless nights
instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat
the opinion of one person should not effect materials being able to be on a shelf or not
better yet you can download the movies media are available with you able to watch them with the click of the mouse
in fact should add more
something seem offensive to one person but someone else find that interesting
i was one of the worst book that i have ever seen we left the library and never came back
friends will talk to each other endlessly through but have no words for each other when they meet face to face
it has a very grand and imposing building
he stumbled across water
one of these moods were appreciative he was appreciative that his parents made a house into a home
to be continued computers have a positive effect on people
maybe you are a third grade teacher and the little kids are driving you nuts go to and educational and fun website
even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better
also many people have important information on a computer
however it is also very foul
the worst thing of all you were not able to spend time with the family member that you love the most
without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression
people also use computers for home work online
if you are going to have any of these items kept in your home then keep them in a place where children can not find them
okay some book are bad and offensive but you have to look at it this way
dear newspaper generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers
while looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past
therefore i hope you like my letter and enjoy my opinion
the issue is people was to much time on computer
there are probably better more appropriate words to use when i am in public but then i would not feel like i am being quite myself
some you could save important from your past
this could help you lead competition thus making you more money
if those are removed i do not think that people would care that much
and some people do find that person that they been looking for
did you know that of the population use the computer to talk and reconnect to friends and family
and last children should be playing outside
whether someone knows it or not when you are typing fast it is help you hands
when you go to the library what kind of books do you look for
in conclusion computers do benefit society
they do more bad than good in my opinion
i think that computers are good because of these reason
as a teenager each book i look at its always about sex or gang violence
i think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all
you be thinking at this point that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing
certainly you cannot disagree with me
nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new
i felt protected by her
young adults play video games read books in school related to
another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday allowing many things to be done by users
dear newspaper computers have advance a lot since they were first made
the best thing to do is ignore it and walk away
the content of a library should be full of various material even if one find certain materials offensive
it has a stone building
people learn the most information out of a book or magazine
in the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past while the spring represents a more optimistic future and a new beginning
people spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising
what has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions
i heard music and learned some
a friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling
the mood the author created in the memoir loving and happiness
schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read especially magazines
sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again
they provide an easier way to life that us lazy need to survive
now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights
the mood of the is happy
if the sun does not rice we
take my story for example
this quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride
this statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way
another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him
second they are creating a unsafe environment
would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away
what if someone burn down you home this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them
a person not only has the right to the best education one can receive they also have the right to read whatever they want
the reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite
although those parents that do not approve of this can go to a different library
even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in
to the past stressed because i never had a to just relax and think about things i computer doing something or homework
sometimes people just need to keep their opinions to themselves agreed
there are many reasons why i believe that computers benefit our society
there are online college and online high school
if we take action rashly or foolishly it may ruin us
math game science game different games you what
movies is to popcorn as music is to headphones
the only man to live a perfect life was and was in a human body
censorship in media has been around since the beginning of
the last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use
remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex drugs and profanities
also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer
one example is is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son
the person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not
computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems
computers can and make you
although people who do want to see that should also have the choice to have that somewhere where they will come across it
when you research online the information literally comes to you
i for one do not approve
for example when i see older brother go on the computer he look much smarter on it
i personally have never been to a library and saw a book magazine movie song that was offensive to me or my family
there are loads of harsh things in the world its impossible to just edit them all out
that is one thing i do not like about computers
whether it is books movies or music a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item
they can make you uncomfortable
my last reason why computers have a benefits in society is because computers help to make better technology
if the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor
when cycling or doing any outdoor sport the setting matters greatly
computers do not create positive benefits to society
first i would like to say that you can interact with family and friends
and last but not least
that means people have less time to exercise enjoy nature and socialize
not everything in our lives has to be controlled by someone so people should lighten up and give some freedom of choice
no one wants to check out thinks that are offensive in any type of way
therefore in the end books should be censored
third some people go to the library for peace and quiet and the library is there only place
scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be
in additionyou can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease
he is agitated by this makes a significant dent in his water supply and unfortunately continues
finally people who have computers are probably happy because computers is a good thing to have because you can do everything on it
whenever there is a test coming up my teacher would have links on her go to help use study
some of these things cause conflict
so if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but effected the entire world should we not learn about our own faults in history
but they also provide an educational opportunity through research
but would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy
i say this because you can learn stay good and communicate
it saves time and effort with a more professional result
as grow up they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling
as soon as a train arrives they rush towards it
earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland the tone was troubled and sad
as you can plainly see computers are not turning us all into zombies
this greatly affects his family
when she failed her mother was disappointed
in this memoir author creates a very specific mood that is the same throughout the memoir
if you want to listen to a song download it in seconds and listen to your
most important of all the life changing story about and how it changes peoples life today
but science has also produced many destructive weapons
as you can see entertainment is everywhere on the web
people just have different tastes in music
advances in technology improve society and the over all way of life around the globe
there are features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey
i feel way if your always on the computers and your never outside then your friends will like you want to be bothered
i believe that all the books are meant to be in the library
however i believe that there are more positive effects than
if so i doubt many people would find it interesting
i think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library
if they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out
children should be outside getting bigger muscle getting strong bones
books movies magazines or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public
you can live your entire life indoors
this is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries
the setting plays a large role in the story
when i was young i visited my cousin
most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for
i think all movies music and books are acceptable
at night he goes on the round the area
on the computer there are many settings
authors have just the same right as we do
there are many website on the internet that teach kids to type
i personally in my own opinion think that would not be fair
it make the person feel emotions that bring them down
make go in the woods and wake around
first we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before
just as remembering the has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes keeping books of the most horrible content save authors from repeating such dishonorable content
by using computers we could read online and conserve paper
with modern day technology all that is possible
some times they are a nuisance to the societysome beggers supply clues to the thieves
many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on
secondly the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool
therefore the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment
that why i feel people are not spending too much time on the computer
on both a computer and the internet there are more than million things you can learn
parents will not want to walk into a with their children and find them starting at images that go against what they believe in
also this ties in with something our country was founded on which is freedom of the speech and the press
then just get a door that says and older and put cameras up
parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others
since then my friend does is go on the computer
i could hear loud roaring sound coming from the sky
dear local newspaper i support the advances in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people
and thank you local newspapers
don’t hurt your dear ones even in your disturbed moments
the story i just read was inspiring
another great thing is that they have books for people in between like myself with teen books that spark our interest
many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information
however i believe censorship is a grand mistake on our part
she asked my sister to switch off the transistor
and i understand how some people are more likely to be offended because of say their sexuality or ethnicity
you can also use the computer to research topics
this is because she says that when they come back in the spring which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life
i would rather live life than be on a computer
meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles
the large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers
we don’t get any food if there is no water
we can interact with each other
i believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons
elders have better knowledge than us
i wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out
hes on a very hot climate in a desert so he needs lots of water but he has a limited supply
he also writes about how he grew up which is parents teaching him about music cooking and family
a computer can help a kid in so many ways it can help students with homework let students talk to friends and help with school projects
everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you
nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires
should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world
dear you think that computers have a bad effect on people
another good reason to be able to use the or computer is you can talk to family members who joined the
with the internet that project can get done a lot faster just by typing whatever you need to know
or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you
by remembering these mistakes mankind will be able to move forward in literature
now you know why computers effect people
a child enjoys perfect freedom
many sayings quotes and even just simple words are twisted turned and made into something they are not
magazines about how we sex and kill each other
one way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet
he cannot eat proper food
the poor people have more children
they just need to have learning and for fun magazines
lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days
for this reason we cannot censor libraries
i have been to many libraries in my life
it sure has happened to me but you know what i do
imagine standing outside the warm sun dancing on your back jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you
or playing video games all day
they just want something to read
you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing you might have passes by many books about racism
i believe that libraries should not have censorship
also one more thing books magazines and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right
the reason for this is because if your writing an email then you should know the keys that your fingers touch
people need darkness to rest
what about the younger children who like to read
so consider liking computers
if i were an expert i would have nothing to worry about concerning computers
in conclusion eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all especially children
the computer is like a addiction
with the positive aspects there is always a negative
next my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life
people are ignoring their health and instead staying on the computer
for these reasons is why computers do not benefit society
censored books are just a way to keep the way we live life quiet to some people and never let kids grow up and experience things
do not exceed posted speed limit represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist
some people want to get a high rank or position
i think she is looking to start over and forget about failing
well that is my opinion on what i think should happen
the library has a section for adults
no because it used the words in a very nonviolent way
they could us that money and buy better books and at a lower price
just because it offends them other people find it interesting
plus spending so many hours on a computer
says a local mother as she talks about a computer game
the effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced not feared and avoided
can bring your family closer together
this is just one step need to take to get a healthier lifestyle
next he noticed the changes in the terrain
it carries its head and neck erect
i personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and have some violence in them
water is used by us in our everyday life
then he talks about the neighborhood and how together are great solidarity and friendships
these novels contain anything from brutal horror to adult material or foul language
this is much easier than calling the person
therefore people have to be very careful about beggars
i think computers are good what about you
to sum it all up computers maybe but every single cloud has a dark lining
should censorship be allowed in libraries
but books are not rated such as movies are
people can look at information faster than ever with this device
whatever you undertake to do put in effort and do it to the best of your ability”
all she knows is what she learned in her country
this connects to the hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again
that is why i think computers are necessary
the features in the story great effect the cyclist
even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from web sites
without the computer many people would not be able to explore these places and learn about them
dear you know that in every families own a computer
no one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer
along with websites games and networks are also very popular and addictive
they showed me with their own lives these teachings have been the basis of my life
they have a right to read watch or listen to what makes them happy
sometimes it will be in effect while at other times it will not
my first reason i think computers have terrible effect on people is because its a waste of time
he was running out of water so he got desperate for some
the doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was in a way in two places at once
this lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist so big that he was near heat stroke
even very little kids can play games
all these ways and more that computers have impacted us
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
plus there is not a bad book that your kids will find at school any way
bullying has been a major problem in the for many years
for example the cyclist says sometimes life can feel so cruel
the setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help
reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing
everybody had their favorite movie song or book when they were younger
so how you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries
experts also say that is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier
it sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it
now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels
there might be a certain speed that a person types and to pass the class and the teacher could assign practice on your own home computer
this meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated
the whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors
then with in two days there would be not books left
life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products
thankfully that man and go online pick the food that she and the quantity and she can get someone to deliver it
first people give him the wrong directions
we want to learn about the places so we can travel there
with over the population being obese something needs to be changed
i was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal
people need to know what happened in the past with historical events
librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read
would you want to be the person to take away computers
taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture
in my own personal opinion i believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people created them
dear news editors my name is and i would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people
this also means that there are smaller incisions being made so that means a faster recovery
to me that is a heartwarming mood
he keeps the books in proper order
secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel
the setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people
then the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body especially because he had no water left
my skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was or
going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all
but we can’t live without water
with this practiced self control they were able to learn the way of peace even in wars
in conclusion i do not believe that things such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from library shelves anywhere
they will not have their own views and will be largely ignorant to the world around them
around the world many people sell their computers to get money to different stuff like shoes clothes or games
limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them
we should always try to do our work without harming others in any way
everything happens online in you portable laptop instead of having to go to and from a college
the schools and ask them questions
the years computers helped us with almost everything
it was very difficult for all three of us to spend that night without our dear mother
then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page
do you now see that nature can be helpful
computers help so many people with everyday questions
some are humorous historic or romantic however some are offensive in some way
just for a moment think what would the world be like without computers
the can helps in ways also
your child finds a magazine
it was offensive to many and in addition it caused an uprising among because of its content
we should try and keep our surroundings clean
some websites are for specific games and same have many games on them
the mood that the author has is and happy
this egg later develops into a small creature like a worm with legs
but would we allow the gays or divorced men and women to take the off of the shelves
would you want the teacher teaching you or you teaching the teacher
if it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books music movies and magazines out
also censoring in libraries where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable can make people rebel and even put the library out of business
by saying that one could sense it is a dusty place
if you think that amazing then read this
so yea the last sentence he said i liked it
no one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read
one way is the setting
shows that without a right to society is reduced to very simple uneducated creatures
along his ride he meets some old but confident men
sometime those things are peoples life and all they do
those reasons being that you picked it out yourself and that you have traveled to the library looking for something you will enjoy
the short rolling hills tested his inner spirit and caused his dehydration to further
back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter
might takes some month to learn but once a child knows they will be outside for hours
he will never forget growing up and living in that house
it saysin the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about
some use computers for other things then to some times just waste time
everyone has their own opinion as do i and i believe it should be allowed
what are we hiding from
she concluded it this way because the main character of the story was beginning to lose hope
if we hear about something wrong in our world today we need to act
we know the roads rough when he says large highway signs dumped out at me
my friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too
i know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse
he is an obedient boy
the library is a place for everyone and not just one type of people
it does this with the mouse you have to be very coordinated to be good at the games on the computer
the mood of this memoir is happy and grateful
he recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more
once again he begins to feel hopeless but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey
this document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive
the other one was water the lack of water
magazines movies books etc
people were rushing around with huge suitcases and bags
kids now a days live on the computer
that is no fair crop in my right mind
or put the books some people find offensive in there own area
they are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you
she will take the test a second time and pass
right now she be sad and scary but she knows that things will work out and she will be fine
he longs for the cool pines and rushing rivers
this is how the author looks at his memories
each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive
when i was in eighth grade i was with some friends
if a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it
please consider the following that computers have a negative effect on people
another great effect of people on computers is socializing and having fun
computers are only here to make our lives
this book was a success story and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through
should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message
this book reveals much about human truth yet it was banned
should a few bad words keep a book from being a prize winner
it too needs to be taken away if the language sexual conduct and criminal behavior messages are adult rated
their best skill was cooking which was fun and relaxing to them
at the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves
some argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable i beg to differ
there are many types of music out in the real world
some people dislike them but they have good reasons why
i think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle
it can be seen how work gets done faster however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing
if i am at the i will always look for a book interest me
well get up and go outside
however i do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there
so the only other option is the school library books
without these books these can become something in the past and nothing more
not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers
then once he picks up that book and sees that its mentioned in the book it wont be that big of a shock to him or his parents
all of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff and its not a good thing
she encounters no buildings for a long time when she does encounter a building it is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape
computers allow you to communicate will people from anywhere in the world
she looks her new country with a different eyes
i noticed the terrain changing
he tries to find out the reason and guides us
i went to see this fair with my friend last week
then you get a new phone number and forget other people number
when children read they learn many new words that are in that book
but some times it is used in the wrong way
so if you want to know what happen next you will have to keep reading on
everything has a base in nature even ourselves
libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it
therefore this memoir has moods that are created by the author
they make lot of delicious food on ramzan day
in high school we were told by our parents that we should not smoke do drugs or anything like that
that is one reason why children from the ages and up are obese
this is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest
i went to the tea stall and had a cup of tea
students develop the qualities of selfhelp in a hotel
i think that parents should be alert to offensive materials in the shelves and should say something about it so they banned them
dear local newspaper i believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society
go outside and play with them sit down and play games
when working on the you get distracted
my parents are doing this to protect me and i agree with their decision
books movies and music are forms of entertainment
so why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom
in my opinion computers are very beneficial
high are filled with pregnant teens
you need the computer so you can print picture for your report
it was very cold at night
the setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards
they were illtreating the natives of the country
however i believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions
the mood created by the author in this memoir is happy grateful
computers are no help to this problem
the rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit
with different personalities comes different writers
it helps the cops catch the bad people
as one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together
furthermore computers continue to help instead with store say keep friends i can talk with friends or family far away
for example you move and not be able to see them again
this probably happens after a hard day at school or work you can come home use the computer to play some music and relax
they also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning
other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or shows
when they were done the girl tried to walk home and she was never seen again
in addition computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily
eventually you or not get diabetes from being obese but most of the time you do
also they should check the ratings on movies or make them not available to certain age group
the irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly
without doing anything but sit back and lip sync
the author concludes the story by showing the girls connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese the winter hibiscus is her connection to her homeland
it make some people upset and if it does then they should stay away from it
is also grateful for both the personally financial struggle her parents had to go through and braving the harsh northern winters
you might not want to go to the library to find a book you can just look it up in the computer
everyday i go on the computer i learn something new
we watch movie to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while
the computer can bring most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done
he was also grateful that he had house and parents like you did
once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem
all and all this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers
it was a hot desert and he needed something to drink
the mood of the author in this memoir was happy grateful and gratitude
the reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands
also changed are the plants
but came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut
you can read and write with out using a single sheet of paper
i am not saying that this is true i am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen
most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out
coming from a teenage perspective at a young age i was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me
i could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals
he goes from place to place to catch thieves and bad people
i have cousin in and i talk to him through webcam are more people then who talk to relatives elsewhere actually almost soldier talks to someone back home
and those are my ideas on the subject about if people spend to much time on the computer but not as much time with friends and family
these games are a great to help people relax and trust me everyone needs relaxation
a student could not go to the country so they went to the second base thing the computer
lastly with computers you can talk to people around the world
should we censor the materials in libraries
i think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him
for they are very important
people also can learn to have a personality because they in use
some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers and i believe that they are correct
that line was from the last page of the story
but the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy
every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences
i think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world
computers and other devices are good for humans especially young people like myself because they are good for communication keeping the attention of the and providing unknown information
there a long line so i just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then hours
where would we be without a computer to help
the setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map
some people find bad language and themes offensive while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author
you ask the amount time spend on computers is much more damaging than this
others have different ideas
the use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important
these are key factors that show us that you can have fun on computers and still have time for family and friends
you simply cannot please everyone
computers have a great effect on people
in this case the author wanted to express joy in her writing
but it is also one of the many distractions
this wonderful network is here in our computers
many experts such as say that a person can become depressed from not interacting with friends and family
computers change all that
i hope you are agree with my ideas
visit with family and friends or even exercise
more than of the population computers benefit society and have gotten people all over the world smarter and advanced
my last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could effect your education
towns have become deserted buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape
creates this mood by being grateful to his parents welcoming family in their home and celebrating their traditions with their family
this is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location
materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy not just to please certain people
or if you wanted to know when died
but think about a library and then imagine a computer
in the last paragraph is says this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
they also miss out on family dinners and movie night
lastly they can be extremely dangerous to children
we did not remove any books pictures or even magazines in that store
on the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to
no one every told him
the story is about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change
others are concerned that people spend too much time on them
but some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children
think about the a day doing fat because of all the fast food on the computer while eating it
reduced social interacting and skills also result
the first example show that she was sad that she fail the test
i think this for simple reasons you gain computer skills which can help in other situations
now that she has this hibiscus flower which adapts to the cold weather magnificently she can adjust to her new life in the united states
they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people teach hand eye coordination and allow people to communicate with each other
he should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water
a lady took a fancy for me
computers are like a pencil to a student
health is a big issue when it comes to computers
computers are a optional thing for people to use in their own time required to do
the comfort with you family and to the mood of family
another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on
the terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them
we all would have not personality at all
bad books spoil our minds
for example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also
in those extreme cases most adults can the read
some of the books people need to know about
also the longer you stay on the more you use it and this habit forms a addiction which might be hard to break
then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school
his appearance too is very funny
dear the effect that computers have on people is not a positive one
that student did not even say ‘hello’ to me
as an example some people are against blacks and others are not
a majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this brings
as you can see there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books music or movies
all it is is cause and effect
he explains that they were all united because the country was filled with racism
adults along with young adults have to know what they should read and whats not acceptable
then because of the setting
when that is not true do to the fact that computers have
he fights for his country and people
there are many games out there that you enjoy
can be more opinionated mature and controversial
because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal
parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children
when students are working on a report they very often use the internet to get information
fact is in paragraph talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had
she had a lot of memories from one home
so he moves on and finally he re aches life
statistics show that of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise are in risk for health problems including obesity
it gives capability to do more than you can imagine
after cutting the cake we played many games
my second reason states that there is some history on many different websites
i particularly enjoyed this memoir
it not true that we have something called books
he would talk about how selfless and kind they were
this statement proves that the lack of physical interaction with human is a crucial subject to touch on
do computers have a positive or negative effect on people
i understand the idea of warning labels but i feel that censorship is too far
a lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf
libraries provide us with knowledge entertainment and peace
the computer give you the wrong info
as you can clearly see computers have some benefits but they have many disadvantages
most importantly you can have fun
in conclusion there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library
if you read more you will see why i support these details
seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
in our great country we have many freedoms one of these is the freedom to read hear and see what we want
a computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people
communication is one of the main reasons people use computers
just as the geese go south and as the seasons change
i do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids
the computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people
thank you for your time
there are many people in the world who like all different types of books
the computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore
this quote talks about how the setting degree weather dessert can him
another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country
dear local newspaper i think that computers are both a good and a bad thing
any thing in moderation is okay
young minds acquire knowledge and wisdom by reading great books
many find books boring but it will help in the long
it could have some things in it that people could find offensive
people are concerned that too many people are spending too much time on their computers
in my opinion i think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to
the farmer is the most important person in our country
in conclusion i feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without
the hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination
this letter will effect others so thanks for reading
it is the choice of the individual to read listen or watch a certain material
during winters he grows peas potatoes wheat etc
previously i stated how people spend time with loved ones well people need to spend more time doing activities as well
some computer games help expand your imagination because when your playing games you think of things that could make the game better
this would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning
aside from communication computer also greatly improve and learning in many ways
you can email each other or search thru up online to try to get in contact with them
others play games online
and it also makes you thinking of all the your family has to make for you
they help you learn have fun and communicate with people faraway
because we are all the same
now you gotta think man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books movies etc
movies over attract both parents and teenagers alike the music entices the teenagers and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children
those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful
the formal mood makes the memoir easy to understand while the personal twist makes the story enjoyable to read
you can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot
that is why i think that computer can answer your questions
although the cyclist chuckles about it this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him
dear the age of the computer is upon us
also it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends
my favorite sport is basketball
every book has a different plot and a different moral
if so you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability
i love books and i hate to see them go away
i also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard
dear newspaper people think that computers are a waste of time and that they are dangerous
it is wonderful experience
also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves
staying on all day sitting down rating
do you think that computers are useless
then at the same time an women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men
should we not be able to borrow or rent this movies
but instead he just sit there online everyday eating
as more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair
that way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone
their should be something like a warning label on the magazines movies music etc
so she just looks up the definitions on the computer instead of taking the time to find them in the dictionary
well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products
the computer is an easy convenient way to get information
your wasting your time on the computers
we could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to make the community as a whole
none was poor and none was unfortunate
you can not go on camping trip
no one wants their library to be closed so libraries should not be censored
the children could lean about different countries far away
there for they cannot blame the place the material was at
making the public recommend the book and it having positive outcome on the press is the best an author can ask for
people get things done quicker giving people more time to do what matters most interacting with their families
taking away all of these things i think is a mistake
if he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water
in the story the cyclist is affect by many features of the desert
i think it is a positive thing for children to know about the past
after these things come to try and adapt to ways of life
the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist
well they can talk and see each other while on video chat and it will feel like still here
the reason the author was inspired was because of the flower
finally society needs to back away from their computers and stop into
he went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water that tasted like battery acid
of parents who took a poll in say they want their children to learn about different cultures
shows so much love thanks to his family friends his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph
the internet can also help people find jobs
in conclusion you live a happier life when explore the
i went to the library one day with a friend of mine and i picked up a magazine
they can also learn about all the wonderful beautiful lands that are out their waiting to be explored
they are preventing people from exercising going outside are are just making them stay in there house all day
parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in
i loved each moment of it
computer source found of in and
first they can help you learn about new subjects
most of all computers represent progress and advancement i see no direct harm from computers
the feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist
movies are in the same boat as music
we researched the customs the foods the way of dressing the traditional holidays and their way of entertainment
the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him
those was some affects the cyclist had to over come
a alert saying that someone sent you a email
they would not let me listen to the music i liked
they help people stay connected with old friends and work
getting rid of that is just another loss of information
he mounted on his faithful horse kanthaka and reached the bank of the river yamuna
the author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring she will take her driving test again for one main reason
but he was in the desert no one around hot dry no water and no shade
when he finally got to a modernized town his spirits were lifted and he was able to get water to cool him down
some materials in libraries have information that is offensive towards others
who wants to do that
honestly there really is no reason to keep making books
the computer is a you to play it
things today are way different
chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency
and his family cooks together which he really appreciates and
magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world
from my own experience i had to get a movie at the library once for a project
people also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive
this poor man’s vehicle can carry two persons easily
by taking off one of these books someone could be taking off another persons favorite book
no we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves
they did not blame the library
schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil
i believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong
i believe that is a from two to three cars
if you watch movies on or they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only
of people in would floor
but if it offended someone should he be allowed to remove it
when we are in trouble books stand by us and give us the right advice
however a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial
there is a reason it is in the library and that reason is because some people enjoy it
the freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people
if you go on vacation and forget to turn off the lights you can use your hand held computer to turn it off
the problem is not many people do that
everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read
the obesity rate is higher than ever and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping
what would most people do without a computer
the people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive
i believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on
so why not advance and invest in the music industry it will provide entertainment and fun for years to come
but bad books poison our minds
is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag
this goes for parents too
this type of music is triggered towards the three ideas of sex drugs and violence
it effected the cyclist very much
so in conclusion the computer is a very good place to go shopping read books and play games
would you rather us not have computers and not know half the stuff about we live in
continuing on he reaches another building
shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living
you can even chat online with friends or maybe find long lost friends
i believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope
you would be mad at them and wonder why
these gems of future are like a human being they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems
i hate cheats and fairweather friends
one of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants
throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people cars or buildings around
why should libraries have one
he needs to get up and move around
she wants her students to be tidy and well disciplined
many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life but i would have to disagree
get up and prevent the negative effects of computers
you can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books
so take them off the shelves
would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy
get on a computer and do some research about it
out of of family members and friends agree with mom
we consume cereals in different ways
they give the news to the whole world
i am proud of my dream
first of all people are to busy on their computers that they spend less time
we should not have an eye on other’s wealth
some street hawkers carry their wares on a cycle or a handcart
the speed limit is also affect the cyclist
some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went threw
more and more people are using computers daily basis but i do not agree that this is benefiting our society
today you can try to create a law or bill that make it through the government now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material
the cyclist was so set on seeing cool piney trees and lakes that when he saw dirt snake and no source of civilization worried him
creating a link all around the world people can find out information about one another and learn what they are all about
the student would need to go through all different books to find specific information needed
for example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game
if the contents of the book movie magazine and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored
with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools
so as you can see computers have many wonderful effects on people
censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive
he found out that kids all over the the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the defeated the
another feature that affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade
when they got a computer we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on
each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology
so it is important to spend some time leisurely
this shows the connection between the main character and the plant
the computer is great if you have to do research
this shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again
it is a good source of entertainment
thank you for taking the time to read essay and i hope you can see things way
overall the sentence shows what the author concludes and think about the story winter hibiscus
these days people are mature enough to read offensive material
i thought of getting down it was then that my eyes fell on a dog
someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program
bring down all that is bad
movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for
he is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals
just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game
dear newspaper computers today have a negative effect on people
she will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life
without computers i would not be able to do this
now the kids know how to say them
it would be hectic right
and so your friends notice wonder
final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read
could you imagine a life without them
computers have a positive effect on people of all ages
no one can stop them
mostly all those you can video chat and voice chat free
do not exceed posted speed limit
she has a small workshop where these dolls are made
it is so the kids can expand there imagination as well
go make some real breathing friends in person
being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you
in my own perspective should be an adult section where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out
in order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain
i do not think that things should be taken out of our library
the setting it the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit in three ways
computers can be used to learn communicate and entertain
for example if you have a history project and you need to know about china you can use the computer
the author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills
people can find the most innocent things offensive
that is in my opinion the beauty of human nature
from electronics to animals
censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries
most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him
like being able to communicate with your friends
do we take it off the shelve and tell the sorry
i hope you understand as to why i feel this way
why take the risk when you can just use a phone
then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test
it hurts the people cutting off their access to knowledge
it is of home and family
putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch
water is very necessary for us
on the shelves of libraries children will find out anyways wither it is from friends or the media
if we went to travel by train we have to buy tickets
the theme of this story is adjusting to things in life
materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library
exercise is important people let that bobby
they can confront the situation about three child
but it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride
take a book that refers to slavery and what they use to call black back then
it was also very hot
spring will come as nothing can stop time
in the world today there are so many laws regulations and even authorities protecting our rights
thinking about her grandmother helps her to survive for better helps her want to succeed in her new home
there a lot of things to life and sometimes we do need as much help as we can get
the librarian says the book was removed from all public libraries because it was found offensive
finally she expresses happiness
you can go on the computer and chat with friends but not all the time
as you have now seen my handwriting is not so great so i end up typing a lot of my homework because of it
for example some material in the library not be best for small children to read or view
if this literature was taken out children think that things have always been the way they are as they see it
when someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys in how much are they really getting
when he sees the corral and the rusty pumps he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst
dear local newspaper computers have a lot of affects on people
the next point i am about to say shock surprise or scare you
nature is at her best in the morning
the success of democracy largely depends on its power to produce the right type of leadership
throughout the world there are thousands of people with various opinions
on top of that you remember you were supposed to meet your sister today who you seen for years but you cant
like we went to a hot exotic place mom looked it up to see what we should pack to go there
but if your an adult you should be able to read listen or watch whatever you want to
now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart and make things better for everyone
you can be talking on video chat with someone from another country and guess what
brownie can work very hard
secondly children still have a good number of movies for them to watch and learn from that can better themselves for their education career etc
personally i have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers
i think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way
he is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him
however that same cover be interesting to a young adult because he be into surfing suntanning or
that excuse is ridiculous
i surveyed kids and said that computers are there main source of communication
it should be colorful and playful as possible
in conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist
there are snakes that are not poisonous
the biggest company need an computer even the need them they are big in you company
she tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will
there mostly for older teens and grown ups
lastly another negative effect computers have on people is there is less interactions with family and friends
for example in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the about for a grade
have no fear the online textbook is here
this is what would happen if we censored everything
do you look at your computer differently
go to college and do something with their lives
some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it
there are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids
the song writers singers publishers and authors who write this material have the freedom to do so
all these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising
to whom it concern computers are beneficial to society
are some books music movies and magazines out that are offensive
a visit to a zoo is an interesting experience
we are also able to talk online with other people who we might have not met otherwise
due to this i have found the tone to be loving and admiring towards his parents
the author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release
when we reached the airport we got on to a tour bus
for ant book you can find some bad thing about it
i do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising
that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
the features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not
now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one
computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places and people
mechanics use the computer to create blueprints officers use a computer to keep track of all the license plates
as you can see computers do benefit the society
books materials like these make a difference in someone life other than you
by this hes understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because hell know what to expect
it started turning dark and he was still biking
the classrooms would be wellfurnished
those are three moods that were created by the author in the memoir
i you to be in of negative effects on people
i believe that certain books movies or music that are offensive to people should not be aloud on shelves
both options are unacceptable
i like getting the full effect out of things
and they wonder why families these days are turning out the way they are the source of the cause is computers
happiness was shown throughout the story
life with computers has lead to less people exercising and obesity rates increasing
libraries are for all kinds of people
with out family life would be much harder to deal with
those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office
it supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about
parents have the responsibility to monitor their children
as a daily newspaper reader i could not quiet my voice any longer
they told me about my mother living in
i believe that this technology is a great help to society today
she was still stuck on her past
nowadays people write quicker and can write full words and sentences
most of the time when people go to a library they go to get books
that can be offensive and is used usually to talk people over to their side
thank you for taking your time to ready what i really think about removing articles from libraries
does the society really want to take away knowledge of whats going on around us and our history
you can change the colors font size and font style on
they teach you skills you need in life
then you can earn a good amount of money and live your dream life
they leave their families back home and work hard for protecting the borders
what impact does books that are for mature people have on kids
i personally concern with these people computers have a positive effect on people
if books movies and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now
after she met the flower she thought of her old country her homeland she missed it
differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special additionally free thought is a right all people should have
without a doubt kids bring home projects and homework everyday right
computers are great because they allow you to talk online
the mood given by the author in the memoir is sweet loving and grateful
speech on advantages and disadvantages of science
but because more and more people are spending time on computers this is almost impossible
for these reasons computers are what benefits society most
besides there are more important issues at the moment
i went to with a group of my cousins and their friends
i have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases
a person who is involved in sports is mentally and physically well developed
people use the everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television
people spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside
computers also can provide fun games and entertain users
this is why the author used the last paragraph then why she did
having cereals every day would keep us away from many illnesses
shows that of people in the go on the computer for help with their
this is not a very good addiction to get into
computers give you access to talking with your friends
after dinner my parents gave gifts to all my friends
if someone just moved from another town or state this will help them meet new people
if there was though they should just make an alternative section for books music movies and magazines that some people think should be put there
here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home
this is a serious concern to our health
the music was always playing and family came a lot
for example new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from you computer screen
as long as the computers are plugged they emit invisible wares of electromagnetic radiation
the same goes for an offensive magazine or movie
if people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read then where is their freedom
instead of going on computers
in conclusion this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase
but the people who like the item say like an explicit they would probably buy it
my second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is technology
the author would not have chosen a better conclusion for this story
it is understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kind of materials such as books magazines poems movies songs
these are three reasons why i think computers are a good thing
it is not opinions or false claims in these only fact
then for young adults i think that parents could try to look up somethings about the book
as the memoir continues the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents
he explained flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
this can improve our travel
at the end of the memoir the author went back to the present talking about the past times
this is my daily routine
it was a very interesting match
also if we are so concerned as to what our children are seeing then that is where the parent would have to step in
then their on the internet out doing their job
you could just search through your bookshelf to find an almanac
the most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water
items containing vulgar language is unjust to most
everyone has an opinion
what would be on the shelves
it was not too hot yet in the morning
basically i think the computer is a huge time and effort saver that every household needs
dear newspaper i am writing to you because think computers really effect people in a bad way
i believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons
back then i guess i only read them because i had nothing better to do which is horrible because you should read books because you want to
this shows that anything can be done when the time is right
many companies make these pictures with all imagination
my first hobby is gardening
dear is a lot of technology including the biggest hit the computer
the reason i know the mood was happy is because she had wonderful people in her life
a mason is an essential person in society
students at schools elementary through college are able to connect with much more information than without computers
censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world
but they show how the character writer or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it
i doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise
he was born in india
she is all alone making her feel small and helpless
this can be a serious problem
he gets everything without doing anything
it would also help them on their reports
they also allow us to type assignments and other important papers
now we are suppose to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly
in this memoir the author is showing the mood as happiness
when you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves
it is wise to set censors in the libraries for students
another example is a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen
the hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life
so when you back a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one
also the internet will more than likely have all of the information that is just as offensive
you can learn a lot too
also if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation they can take care of most of the help on the computer
if you force something upon a society of readers then what will they have left for their own minds freedom
in short i do not believe that libraries should be censored rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents
using computers can help enrich peoples minds
the computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside
some people think that offensive books should be removed from library shelves
the material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining
i hope i persuaded you to like computers more
each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe
right now children can read this information at any time
it looked as if he was drowned in a sea of books
some people spend way too much time on the internet
i find a lot of people to say things that offend me but that does not mean that i have the right to make them stop talking
the snake charmer sat on the ground took his been and started playing on it
four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and out of those four people have had at least one account hacked
it will also allow connection with old friends save time and provide entertainment to all who would like
in the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay
we have plenty of means of communication such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone
using this i keep in touch with my my friend who moved and even a friend from
consequently kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on
if we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad
books should not be censored
it allows them to mature and grow up
shows that the place is deserted
the parent in shock could sue the library for having such an offensive book
these two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times then it was taken away
for example one family view their children using curse words as offensive while another see no problem
so as you can see computers have a positive effect on people
also some people need their computers for their jobs
but when spring comes shell be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding
the author created a warm loving mood throughout the memoir
computers are the wall between inside and going outside in back at the world
so should that magazine be removed
music is especially one to do this
what would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library
they take their food and rush to the water taps
and learn about all the cooking
if the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings then so can she
keeping a persons attention is critical
another one is the built of the road
some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors
for example on the day of the deadly earthquake in most of the world found out within the hour from computers
why not go out side and throw a ball to one another
later that day they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase
i am waiting for the little young ones to come
the features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him
in conclusion the author sets a calm and kind mood by using words and subject matter that i feel are calming
it traveled at a good speed although there was a lot of traffic on the way
the ways that i use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends a family and it also helps me with my school work
being able to chat with friends is one of the best
there are many fun websites made for everyone
dear in opinion computers are fantastic
i have been offended of some different magazine pictures before
first reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want
lastly what is so bad about having a computer
overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework
certain people like certain kind of music
would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish
thank you for your time and just remember your job is done on computer too
she is now more open minded about the situation
they have many features
you can study different foods and cultures around the world
i think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library
google is helpful for research or vocab work
also you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better
in conclusion just go outside and have fun
the mood that the author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had
the computer helps the world everyday
this is all because of one little thing and that little things is the computer
every adult watching the news at night before they go to bed to see what has what if you went to bed early
the first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place
leisure is an important need in our lives
some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street
it could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that
i believe that censorship is still a needed and helpful process
i believe people would get upset if they would banned the stuff they love
luckily her mother brought her to fast enough to be put on life support for hours
she knows that it will be hard and take time but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness
then take a mouthful of water face the sun and blow the water out as fine spray
trees help to prevent drought and floods
the computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with opinion
it would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
have you ever had someone move away and you wanted to keep in touch
however what be unacceptable for children to view be perfectly fine for a mature adult
all the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going
i say again thank you for taking out your time to read this
and finally computers are very expensive electronics they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed
now a days material that is offensive to some is all around
i believe that censorship in libraries is wrong
however i believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways
computers allow students to research faster and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words
to the newspaper computers are obviously needed in society
the responsibility should not be put on the librarians but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material
including the importance of one
dear recently has been brought to my attention that computers have been affecting peoples daily lives
posting pictures on the and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way
for example moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it
these great qualities computers have for people are fantastic
it should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house
so i am going to talk about what i have heard about my family seeing or finding books music movies and magazines offensive
soon many ladies came out of their houses and surrounded them
people who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf
the song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online
finally offensive movies are actually offensive whether this be to the kid himself the parents or the audience that the movie is targeting
millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds
everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books
it allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them
if i had to write a paper on a person it would be almost impossible to do without looking up information about him on the internet
since all people are different no one will like the same movies as the next person
maybe if we could make a petition and have at least people sign it then the book could be removed
library the facts are in the name
some people even must pay for rehab
is a worst case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all
the plant is not in its native home faces many difficulties the cold its small pot and even its general surrounding
they play a big role in society
please read on to hear my story
if you ask me computers are going to soon be a big problem in our lifestyles
they their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history
so lets face it computers are important
there were also no people around to help him or give him water
well this pattern has been going on for years
but really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter
materials are made for a reason
now remember computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy
even some people do online education
i bet almost every kids has played a game on the internet before
as people can see library there are circumstances where a book movie or magazine uncensored is very useful in getting information
there should not be censorship on books in schools
who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie
this point is a simple and logical one
libraries should remove this material from their shelves
in the memoir the author obviously seems to be grateful and thankful because he states it multiple times in the passage
it makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy
some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors
many features of the setting affect the cyclist
the librarian directed me to there new best seller and said addressed it and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop
overall computers have a positive effect
when it got published and you read it and you took it offensive
so this means he needs water but cannot get water
i really liked the adventure books such a the boxcar children and books like that
and gets there in less then a minute
as for grassy flowery land its more of a sense rout and makes you want to keep going and see many things
the internet however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online
i watched them before though
so instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in
let media be free so men women and children from all over the globe can be unique and wonderful
i think the description of the setting enhanced the readers perception of the cyclists journey
they are meant for learning purposes and for work or school
dear newspaper i read an article in the paper debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people
i was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like swimsuit magazines and many more
he had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out
also creates a sense of pride in his parents and family
lastly it gives student a chance to research a topic they are learning about
thousands of students just like are being pestered just as bad and if not worse
if you need information talk to someone or buy something its got it
lastly computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages
by cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds
then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up
in opinion i think computers have negative effects on people
the magazines always have girls half clothed even in seventeen magazine
dear newspaper there should be censorship in libraries but people should be a certain age just to check the book out
computers help people in many ways
dreadful humble time conservative computers are taking away the meaning and enjoyments life that are offered to us
when she entered the first town this sight was troubling
computers are a great thing to have
there is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed
movies that show war torn battle such as world war or world war
just think what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school
it was a chocolate cake with juicy cherries on the top
computers have on people
hopefully my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web
alone with this the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
it is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them
this evidence is located in paragraph
what about your health
they have some bad parts about them too
the love that they got for each other
people can use and etc
these are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries
on the computer you can talk to your friends family but sometimes people are on so much that in real life relationships fail
lastly if you are on long enough enough it will become an obsession
experts even say how computers change the way they act at home and in the public
overall computers are that make life that much more stressful
all that is doing is giving readers less material to read
they teach hand eye coordination saves trees and allows people to learn about everything
this information can spread across the school
well i hope you think about what i told you and take it into consideration
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope
libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book magazine or movie
then our teachers read us books to teach us things or to keep us preoccupied
players carry off the ball and then try to pass it through the goalposts of the opposite teams
those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip
in those ways the cyclist is very much affected by the setting
you can also listen to the radio on a website
i think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer
then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope
there was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier
many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way
the computer can help in many ways
what will become of the uncertain future
some people would agree that some online games are educational
but its not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer
in my opinion we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family
another obstacle during his trip are the hills
one reason i think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it
students should have the right to make choose what they want to read yet some people want to take that right away from students
also to a is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in
for example the series is offensive to some guys and girls
a computers makes it and it through a lack of information to just computer and find it faster
to sum it up many things about our lifestyles need to change
she has built the nest with twigs and leaves
not two miles into the next section
if the average person tried
i know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text
after the wedding ceremony the food was served
this is not what i want to happen though
it can be shipped to your door without going anywhere
censorship in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can stumble upon it is the best choice
if i was a administrator in a i would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express
another reasons i would like you to hear is less time exercising
first less people are spending time outside enjoying nature
shows his love by telling his parents
i myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical themed computer games
i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state this quote proves the dehydration of the rider
the people that use computers have important jobs
i felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends
now anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computer and that computers are bad for society is just wrong
all there features of the setting in addition to the overpowering heat and sun drive the narrator to the breaking point
that my final reason for why you should go with computers
school systems are taking away that right by not allowing them to have a certain book in a school
they might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem
in my opinion there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of
there is always a great rush at the windows
also when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty
how people do you know that met someone or has a friend on the computer
computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us
people like the do not spend much time with family members or friends or even just outside
this all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions
he is and will always be eternally grateful that his parents brought him here so he could have a better life
it would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well
for instance the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink
so tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries
just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away
i read an article on the web page and on paragraph sec
they have lead us to think we can do greater things in life and keep our earth safe and to stop damaging it as much
one of my favorite series is the series by
teachers students parents and grandparents learn everyday with computers
he showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong
to click on something you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen
the source is very helpful to many people
struggle for him was crossing the path of a ridiculously large snake and trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state
when he talks about how generous and wonderful people his parents were the reader feels a sense of comfort
also when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door
the setting had a huge affected on the author
have you ever sat at your computer so long your eyes watered
the features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways
at the end he thanks his parents for everything
those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting
computers have completely changed the world
for a school project in i had to research about
some offensive things are part of and shows how things progressed from back then to now
often say that they are stressed and depressed
there are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive
this leads to my finally topic
with politics being a serious matter many people can overreact when someone tells them what they believe and think is true is really not
if a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate parents should respect the decision of this teacher
that is because they would start looking at it more
the computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular bases
dear people computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them
in this day and age when is becoming a we need our exercise more
what do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet
offensive books to them such as parents or maybe even friends they can teach a child wrong and that child not learn the right way
computer games only cost about and are instant access
they help us in find medical research and to tell weather or not you have cancer
this skill could be used to pursue a good career in the carpentry field
people in can talk with people in
it is not just movies that we have to worry about though
your want to just so you the computer
also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard and work electronics like a computer
this shows that little of the house hold is never out side playing with friends
in our own constitution it states that all are free freedom of speech in particular
you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too
you could tell he was passionate about what she was writing
unless you want to put one of your love ones in the hospital do not use the computers
studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours
a farmer is an able person
for example education has vastly expanded since the computer
this both right and wrong
the setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood
since some internet sources are very social and not all people are kind mean and inappropriate articles and language could be read
computers have had a negative impact on society
is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all
if you are older then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age
if they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning
they effect the cyclists confidence and hope
which than you would need glasses
i have the option signing onto something called or email
one of the moods that was created in the memoir was happiness
i think that we have a freedom to read about listen or watch whatever we would like and removing these things takes away our freedom
my stand is that computers hurt peoples
exercise is necessary in lives
our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence so we think it is okay to do
today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive
to start off computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members
this is another reason why computers can be positive
after riding through the desert the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop but all of them were ghost towns
but they had faith that they would prosper
so there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools
the children be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident
there are hundreds of stories in the world classics which tell us many immortal comradeships
computers are the future and have even proven to save lives
just like how i talk to people about a band we both love
no wonder schools have computer classes
the features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse
brother is attending college at and since we do not see him often
for example the cyclist says not two miles into this next section of the ride i noticed the terrain changing
the mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one
i believe people should not be able to censor books
people are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested
we need computers like we need water
computers are a big thing now in life they help with many things
this is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt
is faraway from us we see it small
i like discovering things on my own
some things come across as offensive to others but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world
it is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well
communicating with others has always been a great part of our lives
this also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips
many more things that are in good use
some people want to read or watch something with such content
next there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast
i would have to say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher should be used no matter the content in it
by putting the adult books section by the check out place an employee at the library could easily find any small children wandering into that section
the technology is there
although many disagree with using computer technology computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries
you disconnect yourself from your family
people do job reports on
i do not think we should deny anyone that freedom
those people now rudely look down on them
the author creates a very warm happy welcoming feeling by describing how friends and family are always visiting and how happy the family is all the time
however she was in a boarding school in while her aunt needed her support
instead you could be on the computer the whole time playing games of some sort
dear computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away
from the creations of rockets engines and planes computers have never let us down
they offer so things such as information communication and life skills
without any of these enjoyments what would people do with their free time
while trying to please everyone some people find some of the material offensive
sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it
its to do school work and talk to family
this a important skill because it helps with physical movements using your hands for example
those people are very wrong
they provide educational information about the students in schools and my school school uses them quite often
thus i urge you to do whatever is possible to use the computer less or face the consequences that come with it
it would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer
most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand
different people have different hobbies
without computers life would be difficult and stressful
to me i feel that they teach me some lessons but it also depends on what type of movie it is
a material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people
things get censored for a lot of reasons too
censorship is kind of out of the way
just like any other industry libraries need people to use their multimedia materials such as books magazines music etc
after you read my letter i hope you will agree with me
many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger
this is the same case with other populations of people
however absolute love is the strongest emotion that the reader feels from the memoir
the best learn about it and help
now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive
when you take a real good look at computers you will see they are just good
if that person is pleased then the first person is offended
i think this because
somethings people find offensive others might enjoy
computers are consuming the lives of everyone
technology is there to make the world a happier healthier and more social place
if a parent is concerned about what their child might read they should confront their local librarian
she never wanted to exercise or doing anything active
now does some of those books seem a little better now
some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal but what is normal
some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place
education and personality development courses are oriented around disciplining the energies of man to make the best of him
the author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined
as a result the computer should be used wisely
it can look up when was born
so go out and buy one
i was standing in the balcony of my house
mutual cooperation in students and sports and games raises the standard of a boarder
considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult
the heat also made the abandoned juice factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist
most of my family members life in and and just for a call its like ten dollars for a minute
most libraries i have been to have different areas for each age group
i you see the computer the way i do
other mothers and fathers are the same way as i found out
what one person finds offensive could be perfectly fine with everyone else
out of that end up getting better grades
none of my friends would have seen or told me about it
i have many opinions upon this issue
nobody made her watch she chose to watch
computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like apps and document folders
yesterday evening i was doing my homework in my room
also computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally
other people were also buying books and magazines
it has a long thin body and flower collecting nectar from them
because the materials some times harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital
eighty seven percent the internet
you would know what its like to be in war
if we allow books to begin to be removed from the shelves we will not be able to stop it
have you ever had to research for a project or report
the snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape
adults who go to work everyday really need to use computers
how many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book
second the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired
everyone was always at his house
the setting affected the cyclists mood in a negative way
thing we let them pick up and grab is video games
this shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each
you might want to consider that parent need to spend time with there friend and family then staying on the computer at home
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
people that do not think they are offensive will read them
so what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf
those are my beliefs about censorship in the library
in my opinion computers do not have a good effect
a poll was token and shows that of students at school who use the computer to look up information get faster and more accurate results
the computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library
when this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again
conflicting works of art such as books music and movies have always been seen in libraries
should books music etc be removed from shelves if they are found offensive
this was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer
i feel that there should not be censorship in libraries
computers have a positive effect on people
people often say that computers and technology are bad for you but yet i think they have helped our society out very well
a library is built for other people enjoyment
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
so at the end of the story she said i will take that test again
for example the cool pines no one in sight and i am alone
everyone is different
that sounds like things you can get at the library right
would ruin the economy
in our modern day people spend to time on computers
it is easier than the hassle crowded malls and long lines
in conclusion people should learn to give some things a chance
the hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice
in places like the fort railway station a large television
i would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others
when he begins to run out of water the terrain becomes bumpier and harder
who can tell you what you think is offensive or not
if scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them
it can do good things like hide actual sexual interactions from children which should be hid from children anyways
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
games teach us the way to face failure which we come across atadversary corner
that children will grow up and become adult then they will know any way
now you can use this technology as a tool not a game
there are plenty of sports players that are on twitter and they are fit
not only those but people are still interacting with others
for example take somebody giving a speech about what they feel or what they think
they can help us learn how to type connect us with our world and bring families closer together
the season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh
some examples of these are and respectively
finally my last point computers make it very easy to make plans or connections
in the memoir i think the mood the author creates is love for family
first reason for agreeing is because some books music movies magazines and etc
you will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat
you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers
the mood of this memoir is
they hypnotize the young children and adults
when the dinosaurs went extinct
plus computers also help you stay in touch with friends
i believe that certain books music movies magazines etc
in my opinion some materials are not too low in rating and should not be for people under age
but also i think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it
with this system everyone suffers
children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though
these have been what i believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist
when a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section they are free to take their kid there
libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children
there should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history
the only way is to close our libraries and shut down the internet
probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer
you cannot get away from it
once the get in learning how to type they end up typing fast
and in the present day world work is the only way to success
others teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best
while on the computer you could also learn new things
many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands
schools also are teaching us about the computer as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more
computer allow families to see each other online
peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless
time is a big thing which many don realize
books teach us about good things and bad things
strongly apply to this
computers have been known to help develop health issues
one of these is the feature of setting
thank you for letter and i will an article relative to this subject
she is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better
ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning
he becomes senseless
we cannot as with rights employ a system of censorship
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
because then you would no how old they are
we will ask each other on this website
they worked hard on writing and publishing their novels they should be able to show them off
dear newspaper editor i think we should have internet or computers at our houses
because of this they are staying inside and on their computer
unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them children should not read them at all
recess is the best part of the school day
with electronic devices such as the player and so on most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly
honestly i have no objections to censorship and other times i do
that way if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check
quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today
going to the library is just as useful if not more useful than going on the internet
preparations were made many days in advance
was put in the story for a reason
this apply to everyone else that they are not accepting it
or if you have a vocabulary exam you can find the definitions fast and easy on the computer
computer also take precious time away from exercise
all you do is look up something and you can find it
there are things in this world that are relative
when you go into a library or book store you already have and idea of you are looking for
do you spell encyclopedia
i get to keep in touch with my family and friends i no longer see
it can easily be counted
we bought tickets and entered the exhibition grounds
am i know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in anyway
if we want to erase as being an obese country then we must get people away from their computer screens
secondly you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends
how does that really help
offensive literature sexual content disagreeable topics
but her more mentally then physically
he loves all kids who come to him
a while it will eventually take a toll on the body
libraries have movies that are rated or
you just need to get used to their surroundings
the other day though i started thinking about it
also it is in the desert in the west so there is a very warm climate already
another reason is they can get better jobs over hear
certain material in this world maybe offensive to their own kind
many passengers came out of the compartment
there is a book out there that you will enjoy
anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person
they were accorded a warm welcome
that someone should just look at the other way because a library is for the general public
he encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together
in the story the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
this is the reason i believe the author ends the story the way they do
readers the computer can help you in your school work
in many ways both advancing technology or not why be inside doing nothing but talking to people
censorship should not be allowed in libraries
this is why libraries should have more than one copy
sex gang violence and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation
but you can always stand your ground and try
they can also read classics by great authors
many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer
in my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it
as you can clearly see computers are used all around the world for many different reasons
this will be used through out people lives
these are just some of the things you can do with computer
why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon
books music movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading
unless you have a bad internet connection you think these reasons are making a good argument
the reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought
its there people want to read it
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful confidence determination and relief
some people would find the example offensive or out of line
i love to play basketball outside
before a person checks out a book or movie they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting
then your friend said playing games
if the government enforces the censorship law people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject
this happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and your reading or seeing at the same time
computers are fun and educational
the condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike they might have not be so dehydrated
the other day my friend came up to me and said meet my friend i met online
then as easily as rounding a bend my troubles thirst and fear were all behind me
i know that i think they are a great to we are lucky to have them
never in your life have you seen an
most music should have a positive message to it
he is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain
he makes everything sound really nice with every one crowded in the dinning room to eat
winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist
looking for some place to enjoy nature it
the answer is no just let it be
when they find that song that offensive then there is only one simple solution turn the freaking radio to something else
lastly the computer strengthens hand eye coordination
we should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed
the book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is being changed
he is in school from to pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer
love for family and love for each other
many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside
think of everything you would lose everything you could never get back or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future
you flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up
but its a great way to stay in touch with people
you just simply have to grab a new book
everybody has their own opinion on things that is what makes us human individuals
as i mentioned computers bring about online communications
so fellow citizens leap off that desk chair shut off your electronic devices and jump back into the real world
i think that the author created a very warming and the loving tone
no characteristic dictates the other characteristics of anotherso why should an item
all right so computers are one of the most important tools of this world that we live in today
it is a doublestoreyed building
dear local newspaper this world is filled with electronics
the first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders
for example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket
finally computers allow people in different places to communicate instantly for the reasons above computers are very helpful to people all around the world
that hurts your health and your relationship with your friend
censorship to a certain extent should not be in present in libraries
one thing they use it for is movies on certain topics
based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map
and and are fine for any age group
computers help people do all kinds of things
the ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance
however should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age
and lastly do you want your put in danger by simply just using a at home
personal experiences are also have a place
the reason is that you can interact with others online
it was not easy to learn
i know i do it all the time
so please be on my side so we can show the public that computers are social
to whom it concern many hours a day do you spend on the computer
with entertainment it is hard to please everyone
he arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted
i actually enjoy family parties
the fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned
the government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in
in closing i would like to add that i can also see why people would want to censor certain things
owning a computer is surely not a good idea
if you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time
children simply are not ready or mature enough to be exposed to everything that books movies or magazines have to offer
mostly teenagers have this problem
the narration states its a beautiful plant she finally said in sad you got itno
in school we should always wish our teachers
decides that he wants to learn but he does not know how
the sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus
why am i telling you this
dear newspaper computers benefit society because they teach people
he ran into a snake which told him that i am getting deeper into the desert
that at least she could hold on to
i feel that books should stay on the shelf however
computers keep your divorce could have from computer
one of them is trees
and you can chat with them as long as there online
the author does this for several reasons
the setting were hot and dry
as a teenager i know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i hope that everything i have fare travel can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find way benefits to technological advances
each person has their own type of information and genres that they like
the setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story
clearly computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society
she still needs time for this as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground
and last the service
for example i just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday
someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion
some libraries do not carry books because he uses curse words
first the hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing
as a result these things the computer gives brings out discussion in the family and gives a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about
all it does is bring some people down make them cry and also so stupid stuff
i believe that drugs alcohol and curse words have a big influence on kids these days
the rice plant belongs to the grass family
in history many things are considered offensive
three lose interactions with family and friends
they see the cover that intrigue them
another way computers have helped academically is in schools
through text or videos online communication is a great help i my life and the lives of my peers
life without newspaper is difficult to imagine
he had many visitors
if the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in will as well
what is offensive to me not be to you
books being taken off the shelves
computers also help you to work for school
also where he live helps the mood
also if the terrain was flat and smooth the cyclist had less problems making the long journey
the computer is a good way to contact family and friend
that way they wont lose each other
reading and writing is a wonderful thing to do and has been around longer than any human will ever know
books manuscripts and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive
if there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand he or she get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject
is is not the same as the actual thing
always give time to life because maybe one day you might hate your self for missing so many wonderful things
dear i think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive
they allow people to pay taxes online and type papers
there are no friendships or communication with other countries
plus the fact that the internet is quick easy
finally the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there
for example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states with only luck id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat
censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing
the author is also trying to create a comforting mood
the setting can affect anything
in conclusion technology will basically help you in the future well
also they taught him to be selfless
directions are very important
it had the word in there a lot
firstly people are spending too much their time surfing the net
the author sets a calm kind and gentle mood by talking about family and friends
all genres of everything should be available to the
what we do believe in or think is what makes us ourselves
the hidden information could be helpful
the rolling hills poisonous snake and the conditions of the road worried her
so she has to accept that she is here home and i think she is on her way to doing that
it is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone
certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people
so they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be or older to enter and a identification card to prove it
our librarian is a very nice lady
that is why the internet is very helpful
computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently
do you know how dangerous some websites can be
by stuttering that shows she was upset
these factors greatly effected the cyclist
in conclusion the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide
music used to be a beautiful form of art but now when you turn on your radio do you hear
also there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself
is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship they have very little reason
the text states the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him
i am going to tell you how they are wrong
and can only create a better person
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful
i mean i find it offensive but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not if you take it off the shelf
no one leaves a family member out
protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to
computers have had a negative impact on society
these books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there
people have a right to choose what books they want to read what movies they want to watch and what music they want to listen to
there could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph
or why is he not touching her
next libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school
the last thing needs is more kids becoming fat
instead she stared at the hibiscus is what was important t
the narration states a large high way sign jumped out at me
it can be filled with knowledge and still have the ability to learn and understand more
communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble
when an author is writing setting the mood is really important
there were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers
if a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch then go ahead and let them watch that material
at the end of the row on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution
this shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on
in my opinion there are some books that i could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons
also i believe we all have a right to believe what we want to believe
along with that they have online books so if they forget their real ones they can still do their homework
he never gets irritated and does his best for the sick
the computer allows for quick and beneficial research
authors are brilliant people
secondly i disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section
do i find it offensive to some
so i believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends
of at states that the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors
the one advance that has stood out above the rest is the invention of the computer
you cant type a message or hide your feelings behind a screen
lastly computers help students because if they need help they can just ask one of their friends through the computer
it to help you to learn how to learn without looking at the keyboard
he wants to tell us about what they did for him
since he made a few wrong turns he ended up needing more water
the addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or you see are real life situations and activities
my friend just get a computer for her office
ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk and felt great
this is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened and people would not be reading any books in school
after that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens
but when he did get to the town that was abandon to
everyone do have their own right but some like offended things
this shows that she is adjusting
she was talking about the flowers smell compares to her grand mothers shell it was the same
i hope that you will too
the plant also comforts her
be the healthy happy person and lay off that computers so that you can get the best of life
this is not because we want it there but because these things are a part of life
its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone that they herd on the radio
what are some of your feelings about computers
but mostly i have to stay back as i am the eldest
her parents would never let her read the books by
if there is something on the shelf someone can find something offensive in it
in this story the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist
offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result
the author concludes the hibiscus is important to her
some people were throwing dust and sand on the fire
as most children experience through their lives they are greatly influenced by their parents
another topic in the is the freedom of choice
even though they had to change jobs and take any possible work
the victim was a person who overused the computer and frequented the internet
there is nobody in the world that knows everything but there are computers that do
computers have a positive effect
censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience
be positive about online chatting or online dating services
it is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways
one of them is books i hate them with all of my heart
some books are offensive but there books and a library is there to provide books
in the memoir the author shows love by not only showing the love between the child and the parents but by also showing the love throughout the community
so what if a book found offensive was removed
i think computers are very unique and important
no one has died yet from using a book instead of google
so get off the computer and hang with your family and friends
by us putting them in book on movies or making song to make them feel offensive is not the best way to go
it is also fun and educational
to whom it concern to many people it is so much fun but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so much that they loved
taking time away from the computer is a smart idea
these materials are not good for children offend people and do not look good on the libraries that carry them
a computer can be used for educational purposes also
and once she accepts the change and becomes willing to start over she will begin to grow and that will cause her driving test to be easier
read more to find out how the internet is good for society
the mood the creates is happy
i support computers and their advancement
this is very helpful to somebody who is injured or is trying to get another degree to get a better job
it is my favorite toy
here the hibiscus mean hope
computers are making that happen quicker
parents need to be for their kids
there are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school
every time you walk into a library you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material
however are some books just too much to handle and should not be read
if book were to be removed from libraries people would miss a story that they might connect with
they can all help you you have been looking for
the hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
the desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest
instead going to the store to buy things or walking to your friends house to talk you would typically use the computer to do so
of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to and happier kids do better work
in conclusion all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended
movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film
mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools
she found that the condition of the wounded was hopeless there
this is just one reason the internet is so useful
well no because they think they will get entertain by technology instead of their family
they can also make it easier to buy things you need look for jobs and many other things
you are so excited until you realize you know nothing about
if we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included
the hills he had to cycle also effected him
in addition computers teachers in organizing files and entering grades online so students can check their
the weather can change my level of ability sometimes
if people spent as much time exercising then they spend on the computer then the average weight of a human will go way down
on the library shelves it contains books music movies and magazines
but the biggest hindrance was along his setting
help us to became someone important in life
surely the effects of computers cant be good
for example some people play world of war craft get addicted and cant stop
secondly email has created a fast easy way to update people on schedule changes ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores
little kids about the age of six would be playing rated games and watching rated movies
the features of the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist in major ways
but at the same time they fight for the right to raise their child the way they want to
oh and one last thing too much time makes you less active
what would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf
and because they tend to want to type faster it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster
the content of what goes into a book is up to the author
another reason is that it maybe snowy or the library is closed
of them are classics that past generations have read in school
at the same time though many of these books do contain curse words some sexual scenes partying drinking and doing drugs
in the memoir the author creates lots of moods
he was always happy to be around family and friends
among all other ties friendship brings immens joy in our life
my first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide
frequently during conversations without a computer nearby the mind is focused on something from earlier that day
the cool pines and rushing rivers this is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun
after passing his matriculation he went to england for higher studieshe returned from england as a lawyer
there are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book and let the child check the book or magazine out
were both online one day and i searched his name to see if he had an account
the examples of things that should be there are all magazines books and service
i think this because about millions of people use computers everyday
now do i thing that the books should be not given to students who are very young of age
the cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water
there are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want
this in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader
their easy access and very helpful
when someone writes a book on something they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing
i believe that the children of today should be able to read and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past
the thing about these is they are displayed in different ways such as music
older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack
there are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and
it was a very heavy downpour
one is based in with training to be a hero
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
i not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would
he also describes how good his neighborhood was and how they were a close knit community
a few different moods went on in the story but one of the most important was loving
the features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly
there are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking
it is electricity that makes our refrigerator geyser television mobile phone work
computers are bad in someways but good in others
should we have censored them
with a computer you can send a message from the computer to the persons cellular device
every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone
then another and another we have no books in our libraries or stores
really that great the reason for it is because the books that are on the shelf is
so friends save trees by not cutting them and make them happy
for example the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish
i remember when i was in grade and my father was across the world on a business trip
how would you like it if someone was putting down your religion
teaching you parents how to use is a great responsibility for your actions
it just changes the entire subject
computers could help you get a better future
someone riots and they get to take off the shelf
some people say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday
thru computers all around the world and going on the computer can open you to the whole world
this is why the libraries should remove all this books movies magazines and even music
i once spent hours on my computer on
dear more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
i believe by following these simple steps staying active staying off the computer and spending time with the family
he describes the household as being very humble and always had open arms and welcomed others
dear newspaper i think that computers have a negative impact on society
some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers
some features of the setting affect the cyclist
but with determinationyou can accomplish anything
i also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
that i have met them i am able to stay them through the computer
in my opinion his mood is happy and joyful based on how much he talks about his home
when i go on the computer i might need to research something that i have interest in
the advance in technology has upgraded computers and now allows people to communicate through them
my brother told me not to make any noise
i have a few reasons why this is a good thing
its take it to even an different level with to male gender
dear people acknowledge the great advances that computers give us but they also put us at disadvantages
you want to do as you can so you have that at
she had to take a test but failed it
for example in they sit on the floor they eat
there are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask were they thinking when they made that
this is because computers offer many ways to be social such as social networking sites
if you want to go to the movies or on vacation you can get the movie tickets online
computer advances are bad for our country and town
not every family can work well with everyone else
so if there is too much racism in a material then that should be removed
the world is not a safe place its scary and mean to the people
books are always important even though i do not like to read that often i still like to read books that interest me
the computer has everything you want for free
people will get to addicted and be lazy
i think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info
last is the freedom of speech of the author of the book
for a school project or just for fun
movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape
i would like to no how some of these people come up with this at
first lets talk about obesity
being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun
another example is the keyboard because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them
although some experts say that computers do us no good computers benefit our society very much
it also helps us do better on projects
they help people learn new things
if you want things that are more intense or out there then you can go to a bookstore instead of a public library
this quote shows how he was given love by his family and friends through these celebrations
maybe i might want to know when was invented or if the universe ever stops
water is found in oceans rivers lakes and ponds
i felt scared as i was alone
dear you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things
his confidence is high and he is ready to continue his adventure
my name is and i am writing to you because i want to inform you about the benefits of having computers
he knew that the move would have to be a big sacrifice for his parents to do so he thanks them often
i also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes
whether that be to exercise or simply enjoy nature
distracting games are a waste of time and cause stress
it going to stop whatever we do
by taking the advise of the old men and taking a short cut the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water
movies should also be censored
computers definitely have good effects on people
fact is one hour of exercise is good for your health
i was reading out of a magazine yes the magazine is intended for adults but i obtained the skill to read from it
newspapers give us information about our country
second they have computer gamed to help kids learn
libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers for their library are students
having computers would create more communication with some people and help keep in touch with family members
the author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister
after dinner my parents gave gifts to all my friends
that is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear
computers always warn us about them
that can be considered offensive to citizens
books can lie about whats about to happen to the world
they could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread
so if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon you can talk to them then
for example lets say you finished watching a special on the discovery channel about
one of my reasons are exercising
the movie had some disturbing scenes in it but i had to watch it for school
feature was the heat
this will help them play games learn or even help people when they are in need
and those were for specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir
libraries are very educational
they can allow you rather than just the author to express your feelings on what was presented in the works
unfortunately most newspapers have vested interests
this means you should learn haw to type faster
traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills
you could never lose touch
the example is saying how the plant was almost died when she bought it
it shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding because it will remind her of home
s they had no problem finding a home
once while i was watching the a man said people died because of playing on the computer for over days with little food or water
after the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered
how can you spend more time with your family
another reason why computers are educational is because you can use them to read
many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate
instead of spending countless hours on the computer you could be playing a sport or activity
go out and toss the ball along with the neighbors dog
from there can look at different topics in a wide spread point of view
everyone wants to be healthy
the staff of the post office works day in and day out
the cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut
everyone in our world has different thoughts beliefs morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others
these could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals
there are way to many people on computers doing anything you can think of for hours
censorship is used most commonly with our movies video games and television
in my opinion it all depends on how many people are offended by it
think about it next to you look at a copy of by is it really that offensive to you
if a kid picks up a book about sex which i highly doubt would be on a library shelf what would they say to their parents
this opened my eyes and now i too am grateful for everything and everyone i have in my life
however all there could be prevented if people simply spent less time on the computer
the author is very extremely thankful for his parents sacrifice love care and selflessness
statistically saying out of jobs in the state use a computer or technology relating to a computer hardware
this sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime
people that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out
sports are very useful for our lives
music is another item that tends to get censored quite often
for example you have to a project on
also he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either
this affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated
computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place
personally i think they are the worst of all
she sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before
when people become civilized they realized the value of houses
it was sad but we promised to stay in touch
finally censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers
but the hills were sure to play with his mind
if my mom said that to me i would stay around the child books
not only the people blood related to your is your family but also friends and anyone close to you
also the narration states she admitted to herself she much preferred it to a big macho
oh this very topic i am agreeing with the experts who say people are sending too much time on their computers and less time doing other things
but spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels
they might be paying a bill by the computer
in the article do not exceed the posted speed limit the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways
should books music movies magazines etc
a child of years old would not have developed the mature way of think of the book
in the story the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud
a hard question to answer
the air was dry and hot the heat was making him sweat and that was leading him to become dehydrated
without a computer how would teachers get mail sent to them without wasting paper
dear local newspaper i believe that computers are bad news
for example in the story he says id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate
as a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown
students can devote time to their favorite pursuits
it made it peaceful because the author gives the reader the feeling that their was nothing to worry about
her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also
there is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some feel offended
so he had to move around it
and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book
and reuniting friends you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button
they were no computers and so you had to go look up your work in a educational book at the library
observation when i look at kids in community playing is that they follow one another
it would be terrible but if you looked it up on the internet you would know the truth about it
all of these materials all children can learn bad habits from
we all know that computers can be a good and bad thing
if a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material
in opinion i benefit people using computers
because of an increase in technology children and adults are not spending time with their families
people should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries
please heed the following advice
your not the only person that thinks that way
it does not solve any problem
exercise is big and all should do it
another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation
computers were mode to simply difficult situations such as typing finding and keeping a record of financial statuses
what he was saying was he was grateful to his parents for what they did for him so that makes me feel thankful for my parents
the situation would have been different if it were anywhere else
the reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again
normally i would have to slave over books to find something
everyone has different views and ideas
computers can give many chances for exploring education
the sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water
i am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way
if you really think of it are computers as beneficial as we think
although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent brutal and cruel no book or any other material should be censored
but people experience less the outside world when they surround themselves with technology
also some books be needed for research
it could be a dangerous poser
last of all i think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills
you say something to the parrot it listens to it carefully and learns it well
not be suitable for most young children
most people would agree that when you have a computer you can just book a hotel online of going all the way to the hotel
he is an architect and runs his own company
the solo cyclist says there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
if you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows texts and music do not let them see it
everyone has their own opinion and what might seem offensive to you be something that someone might want to know about
everyone has their own opinions but i am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries
fit energetic radiant hardworking people if they had stopped spending hours on the computer daily
the computer lets you interact with other keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable
they have a right to write and we have a right to read and no one should take that right away
when the hibiscus is buddingbeing reborn she will take the test
once i witnessed such a fight from close quarters
books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such
computers are a great source of information
electricity also helps us to play video games listen to music and play with electronic toys
when he saw the fish bate shop though he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved
one least example towards the of computers their are many websites that you can
for example when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help
go to your computers right now learn some things
if i had better hand writing i would have gotten a better grade
in my opinion they should not censor books
young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do
dear local newspaper computers have become a major part of peoples lives
if you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer then i doubt you were
children will see and hear offensive things anyways
the first thing i am going to talk to you about is how it is bad
dear i think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it
aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing the computer holds many more wonders
my second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them
another good thing about computers is you can also have fun on the web watch movies even go shopping
sometimes getting angry she shouts us when we turn the house upside down
this happens a lot to average people
but books from before this practice began to happen be found more offensive then books today
wild animals depend on trees for food and shelter and birds make their nests on trees
but really everything you would like to know is right there
many kids or even adults spend precious family time playing the sims creating their own ideal family
the cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real
perhaps getting people into trouble in with
overall the story had a happy mood to it showing love kindness and what a family should be like
in the world today many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved
that day i did not even go to the playground
in conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax
authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust
i think using the computer is great
computers can also have an impact with your vision
also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer
now that are new technology with computers and such people are distracted and do not want to exercise
from young students to adults computers have become a favorite machine modern day technology
not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth
books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy
the features of the setting affect the cyclists mood towards the journey
computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of
the answer is probably no
my mother says she is soon going to lay eggs
in this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is
today are seeing going outside
in some books its has some offensive stuff about that were stated by
he does grate in school too
many people just simply take the ideas of others the wrong way
sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say
finally computers handy because they telephone
first of all computers prevent you from spending time your family and friends
certain things that offend people can be enjoyed by other people
they help you learn and even help with hard life situations
computers make it easier to connect to people near and far
also the could miss out on life changing exercises the kind of experiments that people they would miss out on life as a whole
if you plan to go to the movies tonight the internet will surely give you movie times directions and how long the movie will be
when he saw the bait shop his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved
music is a great way to clear your mind and relax
they have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection
putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these
if someone thinks the content in a book song or movie is offensive then they should not read or listen to it
the story quotes i will take that test again
also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off
for me reading books helps me escape the real world and catch a break
say we take everything off the shelves off every store that is offensive in any way to people
it would be hard to get the right kind of information off the internet because not everything is correct on there
he talks about his family and when he was a boy and were he grew up
so with this way i would really like if there was a scale or organization of books
luckily i was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic just by typing the keyword
i believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing but can go too far
or to learn about places that you never been to before or would like to vacation to
my last opinion is if we have computer
one example is that people that stay on the computer wont have much fun on other people
if someone is thinking about going to then they would probably go on the internet to learn about
i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink
the cyclists expedition was hindered due to many obstacles
computers have databases or websites design to have with research just as the do
especially when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it
if we need communication we have phones
movies on the other hand are censored on certain channels
music magazines books and movies
other use them to talk to family and friends that are far away
public libraries are a great help for the community
the house was decorated with streamers and balloons
having a computer can make you lazy you from enjoying nature and can have you not spend time with family and friends
it all just depends on the person
he is called the father of the nation
meditation makes you incredibly calm and you will never be touchy and irritable
but at night after dinner i started feeling very tense
during the whole time that there is death in the air the desert with nothing growing no water the cyclist is thinking about his death
some people believe that censored books music movies and magazines should be removed from libraries
lastly computers are a way of contacting others
plants and animals too need water to survive
lastly is a website where you can add friends from all around the world
think about your children when they grow up they will need to know how to use a computer for school or even a job
some books are offensive to some people
they allow people to communicate their ideas and opinions
according to economic every hour you spend on the computer you raise your electricity bill by
children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out that music
teachers principals business men and even children deserve the right to reading what they like
you can have fun with computers
i also think it good research to browse people
no one is forcing them to look at it or use it
and as a mature adult i can
people could act like someone else
those are the reasons why i think the computer has a negative effect on people
but creators of the computer are worried that people are spending to much time on the computer
second reason is people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising
therefore i have decided to become a teacher
magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on
people that changed the world and other information
tons of these people have not seen were
this is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water
today libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials
this quote states the changing terrain
so as you can see i have made an opinion on what they should do either keep the books magazines or movies off the shelf
also if your stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator
i this setting he used up his water and it was hot
music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries
they have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want
if everyone spent less hour on the computer it would become out
since computers were invented a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place
i believe this because i too want others to hear and read about my ideas on how to obtain lifeliberty and the pursuit of happiness
one and i were all going to work on our project
how does this relate to libraries you might ask
with censorship one can not fully express there self or opinion
this shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring
whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online
dear much do computers affect our life
i know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others
when you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam
should the children of today be deprived of the truth
they give us the ability to learn at home connect with other people and give a source of entertainment
dear local newspaper people are talking about computers and what it does to us
everyone has a book they have read that does that to them
those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story
another feature was the heat
with gaining more general knowledge you become smarter
think a head years from
they should be where the people that are or older get them but i still thing that they should not be and there
soon i was one of them
gives me a way to talk to photos with and leave videos for my friends
kids have a lot of energy and they need to do something productive not play computer games and talk to their friends
they would be the kind of people who uses the computer or a different electronic a lot
i know that somethings are a little risque but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution
computers are making a great impact
for some people books are a great past time
there are many different features such as the weather road condition and how the person is feeling
if they had the freedom to take things then there would be nothing for anybody to read listen too watch eat etc
numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated
they either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library
i can say i am in to abnormal stories
in a way books are both bad and good
because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state
if certain offensive things were taken off of the shelves of libraries such as music books etc
they supermarket for you
i see it more better to have offensive items such as books music movies magazines and etc
so to the computers help our society thrive
i believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done
this world is harsh and not easy at all times
suddenly the bus stopped
movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for
another one is that because there was nothing around him he felt frustrated
dear computers have both negative and positive affects on people
if everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books because something would offend someone
even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness after she fails her driving test and is missing her home it is still a symbol of hope
why parents come have not wanting to anything
they should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities
so if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic
there should be an age limit on some materials however
you can gather information from servers websites you can create and learn a lot on your everyday computer
without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it
it read rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
if one person thinks an art piece looks unique another not see any true beauty
also someone else is thinking different then they are
use it for entertainment
also he kept going to abandoned buildings
these are a few reasons i think computers put a positive effect on people
ever since then many people have had a better life
on several occasions my family have planned trips together even though we live across the continent
otherwise a demolished love of reading crushed individuality and separated population be born
finally there are many online games that are very useful
then we as people will wonder what will be left of us
at that time i feel to embrace her
i know a kid named who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over
you can buy plan tickets
it shows kids that not everything is perfect
in conclusion building playing and jumping the list could go on you can enjoy the outdoors
all minor adjustments and easy to make
i sat quietly next to him
authors have the right to write what they want
we need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids
some books movies magazines etc
probably angry or upset
now he way pounds and he is only
yes parents believe that having things censored will be better for their children but children have much more technology and much more access to uncensored music
before computers became popular people had to work and look for
you can easily keep fit if you obey the laws of health
dear editor computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race
three features i found were the lack of the water the heat and the conditions and limits of the road
about every two years a kid or parent could go throw a computer
this quote is saying that he is dehydrated in is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain
this is why we have public libraries
a child will only learn more by challenging themselves
there are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library that does not mean you have to read all of them
they read books about sex guns and many more because they think its exciting well guess what its not
when it comes to libraries it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions
i also believe that using offensive remarks just another part of our history
if someone wants to write a book on what they think is right then they are allowed to do that
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
regardless of how hard we try children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives
should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
if a person walks by and feels the book is offensive they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away
staff members should think to put revealing works up to where the younger generation can not find them
while this be true for some people it is not true for
i solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family
first of all most people only have a limited amount of time to things
when you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip
now they see each other almost every week
once she sees the plant in bloom shell know that she can take the test again
book censorship limits knowledge
i think it was happy because it says he loved to cook and he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook
without it they will have sloppy handwriting absolutely no chance at sports and much more
and with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes
how to make this noble dream possible in the present day unrest
how could you resist those temptations
computers are great they can help you with anything you need
each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library
movies in the library are for teachers to show students
the unique quality of a person can be developed with the help of a good hobby
instead you should keep working hard until you get it
students contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment
so he starts riding again
they can even monitor what your typing which could be passwords
brain damage could be a serious problem that could be caused by something as simple as looking at a computer screen
the first reason is that what maybe offensive to you not be to someone else
he really shows the people who have read his memoir that he respects his parents and thanks them so much to make his life better in
large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics
but i do suggest that everyone should have a computer they are helpful and fun
for example if i was to not go outside for a whole day and i got to spend my time on the computer i would be miserable
if someone wanted to read a book on the then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out
i support the advances of technology
so fight for the right to stop the addiction internet use and live a great life
when i have an essay to do i always use the computer first
people are not going outside as much anymore
it gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in
today a lot of children and teenagers are getting bullied
so in conclusion my ideas where
the last mood i thought was happy
you can let people know what you are doing or tell them you sad because your dog died
but when someone looks at the facts a computer is a great thing to own
books can be a way to learned new things about someone
you could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds
the mood was happiness and loving toward his two parents
nowadays computers have a major chance to do that to you
most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read so they would not even look at them
my opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good
she kept say how much she was thankful for having such great parents and a great house
people around him have a good regard for him
well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology
they gave up everything they had for her
now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family
that is one reason why i do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea
this is why the taj mahal is seen as an eternal symbol of love
the use of computers and the alone allow us to learn about the way of life in other places on talk to people faraway and express ourselves
so the reader watcher or listener would wait for more and by the music book or movie
i do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music
it takes risks to guard our house
these technological advances have given many people the general knowledge that they very well need in any given situation
even books have sexual contact and language
computers as you can tell are extremely helpful easy and fun to use
without the computer families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button
i know you the local newspaper have a very hard job and decision to make
they tear leaves from the books
i told you why i thought they did and how
i think the area where the most offensive things are are movies
they help people of all ages
dear local newspaper i am here today to state my reason why i am against usage of computers
computers can even help connect family members who live long distances from each other
computers are often helpful to those with special needs
my personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended
it is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles and different perspectives
dear i am writing to you to inform you that i agree with the followings said on the writing prompt
you can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores cool is that
even if some people get offended
you can also to see a love one that you miss
you can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library
as a consequence kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the all day instead of exercising
just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read listen to and watch what we enjoy
this shows how close and kind the neighborhood around the house was
my first reason is that computers allow people to stay in touch
why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children
then it would be hard to learn or teach anything
instead of going on the computer all day we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun
it would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end
i believe the current way materials are censored and removed works and should continue
i do not agree that books and or magazines can be taken offensive
where there are chat rooms were they can interact with others
what you have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button
if you take every offensive word out of a book chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it
smoking can lead to cancer or death
my opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries
if someone finds one aspect of a work offensive that does not qualify for the work to be banned or discarded
they wont enjoy as much by stay on the internet
computers and internet are a recent innovation
he cut and smooths stones with those instruments
such items can include music books and movies but i am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue
lastly i would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer
this will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has
i believe the mood is one of gratitude gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well
whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move
plus you could get at places for working with computers you could make programs and anything you would want
if you are a shy person this can help you
going up and down hills and pedaling really hard
the book offend one reader it could also inspire another as well
i believe that each individual person is entitled to an opinion
lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing
when i have a project i always use the computer to find important information about the topic
to communicate with my family in i use a webcam
that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves let alone even be on the shelves
their loyalty to the party is greater than sense of fair play
they most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them
kids these day need to learn more about other cultures
but the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for
the music you listen to has a huge impact on your life
the cyclist in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit is about a great adventure gone bad
so parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library
they will learn to use there eyes arms and hands to there advantage
even education is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge but in the long run does this really help people
players should be fit with strong arms and legs
computer link the world together and greatly advance communication positively
i think computers help a lot in life
we type reports learn read online
therefore computers are very important for communication in our society
the mood shows admiration towards his parents
they even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away strengthening your relationships
the setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills
could this be the cause of obesity in
if the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit
advice from elders always helps us to make up our mind
however with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what your looking for
also you could play online learning games for free or buy a with more options for learning
if you are one of those people that love to be on the computer as much as you can
keep the books on the self
what would happen to us with out this wonderful invention
there is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety types of books out
there are also lot of different in what people want
he works hard and he loves his works
parent want to let their children to learn much as possible
do not get me wrong these websites are fun and cool
life would be very hard without them
it explains how the rough road tumbleweeds and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water
i believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children
if a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good
you can see places like and even
books movies music and magazines are made for people to look at read watch
we are teenagers and you were once a teenager
how do i stay in contact with them you use
books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body
my first reason is playing games
the only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years
the students go to the libraries to get some books on it
this story shows the love they have for each other and that even though they might go through some hard times
another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things
final reason is computers allow you to talk online with your friends
i listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life
sometimes the biggest land animal the elephant to runs away from it
kids can learn more but they spend too much time on line
dear local newspaper opinion on the effect of computers are that it depends on how much you use the computer
also by them having there family with them while in made there moods more positive
when the cyclist continues tumble weeds that look like diamond head snakes cross her path
i found one that looked interesting and long story short i just so happened to stumble upon a love story
these books movies and magazines come across as offensive to some people
have you ever read or seen something that u took offense to you or others
we shut them off to spend time with each other
he loves his parents what they did for him
without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade which is not as presentable
people think that computers are only used for games but in reality they teach us things about the world
so if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway
however if there is nothing they know of nearby they will start to lose hope
the advantages were their were hills to go down
if the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class
she has four kittens
time limits can fix this problem
lets start off with a book that has killing in it
so do yourself a favor get off the computer and go visit some really great people
first off computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you
i am going to tell you all of the reasons i think the books should stay on the shelves
movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book
removing anything from the shelf is not bad
it would be as if your trying to control what people should be viewing listening reading etc
first of all you can get a better education learning from them also it is a great way to communicate with people
yes it be true that adults like to read about sex and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read
this just adds onto the fact getting the exercise is important to stay healthy
the setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing
in conclusion computers have a strong effect on people today
do you ever have time to read
in the text it states through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now
to see such selfless act is just wonderful
so that why computers help out so much in this lifetime
teachers use the libraries for many different things
the animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help
i know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work
some of these books present great learning opportunities to students
this just shows how much the them and how thankful he is
this affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament
although there are still many racist comments articles and films published today
it was a sad hopeless laugh mind you but at least i still had the energy to feel sorry for myself
and all those websites can help
i am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me
also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we here in these days
obesity is also a big issue
he was losing his strength
people have a craving for information they like to learn and advance
i am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason
they must learn how to become successful in life
authors express themselves through books and articles directors through movies and musicians through their music
children should not read or watch anything that are talking about drugs in a positive way
shopping going with you friends and family
one you can use them for almost everything
in conclusion this is why computers are very important to have
with a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them
first of all the weather causes most of his problems
the features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water
we all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children
nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world
since they want it more they will find away to do watch or listen to what ever it be
most times i will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie
i do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in libraries
many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page
it is not illegal for a library to have a rated movie
so this guy is getting it pretty rough
they are the perfect tolls in modern society
instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it
if they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do
the cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building
the budding of plant and spring represent new life
how else am i supposed to keep intact with my loved ones
also computers now have videos all over on how to do things like how to and other useful information
nothing is censored like it was back in the day
you have all these things you condo
i believe that the media such as music magazines and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society
finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them
the mood of this memoir is love and staying a family
if you were offended by that one thing do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned
the second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus and the geese and the change of seasons
therefore its going to be very hot and hell need a lot of water t stay hydrated
is it not surprising
the disabled some due to natural causes and others due to their mentorshave no option
at times of war they are the first ones to come forward and fight for the country
to me it was irritating
as the setting changes in the story so does the cyclists narrators mood
i think you would horribly and you would want that person to go to jail
removing those small things however could grow into a bigger problem
all throughout the world there are libraries
another reason was that you should always help your family s during bad times
i know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but i think technology is ruining some peoples lives
and that makes the world safer for every one
if the players start disobeying the captain there will be anarchy in the field
this is not the way to go in society
you can go to a different store for enjoyment
the talks about his parents immigrated to so that he can have a better education
i would like to that the i for sitting and reading my essay
that shows her important computers are and how convenient
this means it was just a random house when they moved in but when they were done became a home
yes you could get on the internet but it might not have what you are looking for exactly
for example lets say that your doing a report on
libraries have all kinds of information
if we censored all the books that offended people we would live in a very uneducated world
learning brings achievement a computer brings not succeeding
the music poses a problem though
the concluding paragraph explains her next goal
i soon got chubby and gained about lbs
no matter what type of book it is it still tells us a story of another place and another time
computers cause you to turn away from them
when they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight but they never do it
in libraries they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to before they rent it out
off people exercising out with time in the computer which is unbelievable and terrible
then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things
without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily
if everybody liked the same thing then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item
seen almost in every part of this country
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
so when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books
there are movies made for adults but how many adults let their kids watch them to
by using censorship you are sheltering the world
its simple if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries
computers are the easy environment friendly alternative for you
it makes it easier to work on projects
and spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off
all of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water
just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one
he serves his country and his fellowmen
we can also use computers
every book should be in the library
censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years
if other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad there is nothing that you can do about it
so should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library
now is the time to take action but making more clubs or activities to people
no one really goes for walks any more either
then there is the issue of offending people
many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty
the cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting hes placed in just gives him no hope of survival really
then when he found the fish camp he was overjoyed with relief
in the middle of the story the mood is strong and determined
they have every right to protect their child from dangers in the world but to keep them from learning the art of literature
there is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational
secondly some children spend more time in the grate indoors than the outdoors
furthermore just from using a computer anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the
they can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs and can connect you to anything in the world
not only does typing quicker effect your computer techniques but also helps you outside of your home like in sports
it is no mandatory to go to one if you do not like what they have then do not to the library
instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as do research
what kind of message are we trying to send to them
there are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic that books and magazines
there is no reason for a censor in a library
another reason i have would be freedom of speech
int he library there are many magazines that are meant for adult eyes only
people have become addicted to computers
this is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story
the mood is a very happy one
if the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items
that whole paragraph really gave me a good feeling and i could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the festivities
libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community
in other words is that computer help a lot of people
now since i am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things
there was a priest present and everything
at every click of your mouse there are new things to learn
it is also good for improving memory
dear local newspaper you think computers are great for everyone
libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted
you walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive
we use it everyday during sports taking notes even playing video games
as a result this is why the author ended the story with that
is the new generation of mean
but also regular people for example teens do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day
also people can learn about faraway places
finally it is also helpful for all the tools that can be used to interact with friends thousands of miles away
i know you as a would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would
my main reasons of this argument are
also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant in which her mother is shocked about
every book removed from the shelves is another learning experience taken away
then after that the main question we would ask would be should we do next
taking the to everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life
the definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time
if the reading materials are already in the classroom they should not be removed
a clear and complete access to all information how can one make any valid conclusion about anything
my mother took me into the library and i found a book a
i was always the youngest out of the people i hung out with
here are some points to consider
it would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it
you can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master
if people cut back the amount of time indoors we could probably bring that number way down
a teacher can change the fortune of his students
the mood of the author in the memoir is that he is very proud in what his parents have done
these experts be smart but they are wrong
computers even help people in school for people like me who broke there arm and have to take some test on the computer
there is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law
dear local newspaper i strongly believe that computers have a great and beneficial affect on society
you can learn history about famous people places and events
being so drawn to your computer can you indoors instead of breathing fresh clean air which is outside
struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life
what if your phone is gone and there is an emergency you can get the email
another car with red and blue stripes was following close behind
in the end the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him
its opens up to be beautiful again
he loved where he came from
the government of a country is there for keeping an order
i believe that there are certain movies music and other things that are bothering parents
after reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents
around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love but never did i find a fairy tale of two princes
depriving them of how there use to be slave owners slaves and racial comments
say their a teen and end up finding you that is why parents should not be let their children be on period of time and should be on
you can learn just about anything on the internet and most of it is absolutely free
no one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom they are just sitting on the couch watching television
you can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day
there is a banana plant also in my garden
dear people have computers and people use them
thank you for reading my essay on why computers are benefiting our society
lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge
there are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves
with computers it makes it possible to go online look up the research it and plan a flight there a week later
in order to maintain healthy you have to eat right and good in riding a bike
the second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people
nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though of course
this memoir is inspirational
with the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back
people are not leaving their house and not getting active
we need to make rules to keep people out in the open out to give the generation a healthy life
censorship in libraries is something good to have and something bad to have
they sometimes have to endure extreme climates
remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie room
i say its a library let us read what we want to read
you can clearly see how we are growing less energetic and much more careless of our time
for example things such as religion
that is messing up the relationship with your family
finally you know how computers affect people
this evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried
in the book firemen would burn any book seen within a home
when he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration he despairs
i believe that the technology of computers have a positive effect on people
we all have a right to read watch and listen to anything we please
so keep the books around its only words
take anatomy books for example
she ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life
if others spent at least a half an hour being outside to some fresh air instead of using a computer most of them would feel a lot better
some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive
it should be held in a separate area if people do not wish to view this material they simply do not go in that area
computers are nice to have but be careful not to whittle away all of your time on it
computers teach us new things
i think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world
fortunately he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop
now we get to magazines
because he listened to their directions he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration
she brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying
she is sad and misses her home especially after failing her drivers test
you can make a brochure of sales and expenses all with an easy stroke on the mouse
the setting was rough
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
thus we would be creating that unwanted barrier
the wife was very close to because spent the computer helping there can was always in the on the computers
people will soon stop believing that non sense and eventually stop purchasing these newspapers
lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research
you might think that computers are helping society today but you are wrong
also they end up getting in trouble in school or at home
computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places
sometimes what is considered offensive to one person is essential to another
a computer can help you find directions to almost plan on earth
with my own experience i know these cannot be a worse kind
now its your turn to jump on out of virtual world and put your head back in reality
but they must come to understand that those same books help people tremendously
the water was really not and it tasted like battery acid
whats to stop them from censoring everything we write and say
everyday i spend at least our writing something up for school
the rough road was also a problem for the cyclist
books are gateways to other worlds
everyone on in and have a time
traveling according to sir francis bacon the famous essayist is education
the setting affects the cyclist because hes in the middle of nowhere with no water
this has also helped us in wars
in my own opinion computers are great addition to our world
books are for any reader that decides they want to go to that world
if items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left
all kind of books should be in the library no matter what in my opinion
when we saw each other at school we found hard to carry a conversation and took some getting used to talking face to face again
another reason is that it helps people learn about different cultures religions or traditions
nothing is causing obesity in them computer
instead you can type it quick and use spell check
they enjoy the clown’s antics and his remarks about the other actors
the more information you have the better
but in this new country his parents were struggling personally and financially but even though they started life all over again
this is an example of how stores connect to their customers
all of us were very excited and came dressed in lovely clothes
censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them
should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive
the computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich ones life
if they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best it tends to ruin the quality of their character
authors have just as many rights as we do
to the editor of the i am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society
rated movies usually have gore sexual themes strong language and things little kids should never watch
many kids not mostly boys to what i see at school are absolutely loving online gaming
computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
no items should not be removed from shelves if they offend people but conditions should be enforced
when people are at the check out desk at the library the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive
if not by word of print word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries as they would have come to if reading it from a book
for example internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else
you do not need to spend tons of money on it it is all free they are social networking sites
people spend hours on these websites talking to people and forget how to talk face to face
show that you don like don watch it
people say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives
computers help people talk online with others
if something is that offensive to that many people they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like
the interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly
so yes computers have a positive effect on people
this also leads to higher crime rate believe it or not
the only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic
my first reason i believe computers are good to have around is
there where a computer can help you
why go out to dinner when you can order it online
remember how we used to have to read the newspaper to find out about breaking news and important things
she loves to eat carrots
i would read all of them this year
i swim on a swim team for a
still the question is this will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down
this is her new home with new hibiscus
we see street hawkers every day
somethings you could learn about on the computer are places people animals plants food etc
the reasons which i am fighting for tell why kids are in school more than half of the school day
or do you want them to know what they should and should not do
this quote show of some of the dangers the cyclist encountered
she was able to make a connection with the plant
i believe most things such as books music magazines etc
he lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die
he arranges the letters in order
the world is very vast and every part of it has a different climate
in this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland
the cyclist settings hinder him in the essay rough road ahead
such as political cartoon
parents i believe that certain materials should not be shown
many other people use it for these reasons too
computers are needed to help people learn in our society
most college students do their homework on the computer
most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways butt i still looked through them all
now in the computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit
the terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling
another way mood is expressed is through his foreshadowing showing kept the tradition going
online poker could be dangerous
many children can go an entire day without sitting down talking to their parents
this goes for literary items too
to become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past
dear a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest
a case take action to stop using computer
my mother who saw that my father was harvesting in the paddy field alone went to help him
one of the memories is the kitchen
were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just cant think of it
for example i would have a room for and a room for
she went through a change much like the geese do every winter
blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too
in conclusion it has to be obvious that i feel censorship should be used in libraries
the cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening
censorship effects everyone from a small child to a grown adult
many people find this movie funny and entertaining
this shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started
however she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back
my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture
he then began to feel relieved that he could get water
the shopkeepers are honest and sell quality products at reasonable prices
she loved her old home but she realized it was time to move on
spending time with your family is so important because you might miss so many wonderful things
i sat under a shady tree
computers have great positive effects for everyone
we should be able to read what ever we want
you just cannot censor such a great book
when the cyclist started his day off ready to go
this game develops team spirit
that is why should have internet because you can still go online but have fun outside to
i promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view
in conclusion is a very useful thing
how times have you seen those harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple
another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things
those who support advance in technology believe that computers have a positive affect on people
the biggest issue he faces is the weather
although most fail to be banned right now the world is very unpredictable
in that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about
library is a good source for reading books listening to music or watching a movie
before you bring books off the shelves you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right
if computers did everything for us would be mindless slugs quick
there are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
where he was at was in the middle of no where with no buildings cars or structures in sight
they agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed
another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book they want to try and experiment with drugs themselves
so just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you
besides searching for information computers can be used to document data of your own
this is not a good idea for spending the holidays
that could make anyone feel uncomfortable
there are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library
he begins to despair even more
dear in my own opinion computers do not have a positive effect on people
the story tells about the girls transition into the different culture
personally in my opinion i have no problem with anything found in libraries today
also the hills made the cyclist very tired
however people say that computers give the wrong information many times but you find a wonderful website it will never lie to you
a lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability others disagree
he pays for it later when on his bicycle he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration
do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity violent slogans or jargon
from the frying pan to the fire was never truer than in this case
just think without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours
one example is flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
i also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from
if the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances
people are also in busy with there computers that they spend less and less time enjoying nature
however just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading
first she wants to adapt to the new this new land
dear who ever this concern i think that people spend way too much time on computers
even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know
no one should say anything
newspapers publish government policies
this is what i think on the censorship on the book movies music magazine etc
adults and children are becoming smarter each day
so i can see what too much computer time can do
her tone tells the mood by writing with passion
the library a wonderful place with many genres of literature such as children books nonfiction books fiction books adult books movies etc
a physician told me that people who shop online have less stress than people who go to the store for the same items
now is the time to get on your feet and find something else to do
a simple message though one of these websites will make someones day and could even make yours
when he says this the reader imagines someone in an
libraries are government funded organizations
these computers helped to industrialize and grow our great superpower of a country
the only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers
this line also describes the mood as very calm and loving because he is extremely grateful for the life his parents gave him
mr kailash is a popular person
we need to make sure our children be more convinced about this topic
he will thank god through prayer for all his blessings
computers are great sources to do school work they give you information your looking for and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends
some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer
dear the use of computers is not beneficial to our society
dear our local newspaper has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers
along with not being good for the environment it is also not good for the economy
do you want your child to learn
in conclusion i think computers is a great invention
without computers people would be less educated about the people cultures and the world we live in
certain people find things offensive and others think it is perfectly fine to have in a library
another reason why i the exports are right about people and computers is to learn about nature and learn how to do things
these are only a few of the reasons i think computers are great
people can be influenced to do just about anything
you know the average teenager spends at least hours on the computers
the computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology
that shows she calm down already she feels better with her new country
i recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature
just learning how to work them is a new skill
taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book
it seems as though the more dehydrated he gets the worse things became for him
originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places computers have been proven to do quick the contrary
computers are great but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of activities
some where we asks for a drink to there was nothing around for miles
seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will giver herself and newfound integrity to go try that driving test again
seeing this just crushes his spirit
said the book explained what guys wanted
when she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian
i was thoroughly disappointed
the writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph
so once again i would like to let you know that we can fix this
it takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it
there is also a great rush of passengers at the inquire office
you also understand about what to do with offensive books
if someone wanted to rent a book and it was not appropriate for them to read then the librarian or teacher would restrict that book from them
this could got their eyes off the computer screen
a good book is healthy
many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive but only if you take it seriously
we should not have this right because it would not be fair to any one
some people go to the library just to see them kind of books
on the computer there are videos that show us new yoga move and other ways to lose those extra pounds you gained over the days
because complaining will more than likely do something about it
so i did not get that book i just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong
children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision
to end this story my reason was yo can find stuff online my second reason was you can have fun
he was also able to send us pictures which helped because we all missed his face
he thinks of the nation first and of himself later
anything about a family coming together is loving
secondly people especially the younger generation spend excessive amounts of time on computers
also when it comes time to pay taxes fill them out and pay on line
this has not only made leaving but has also helped in studying for tests for elementary school
the author kind of gives you direction idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds
music can come uncensored and censored it just depends what you want to hear
which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship who should be in charge
every time i walk the room my computer is hooked i grab the pull up right and do
a similar thing to this is instant messaging
in removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece or even life long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself
now before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad i can assure you it was nothing other than stacks of cards
this shows the author is grateful and happy
people think the donkey as a stupid animal
if we silence the author and there story or song how will we be able to view life in another persons view
despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication
of course its out the same as being there with the person but its pretty close
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist
the setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways
i feel like everyone should try new things
they could throw the music out
truth is there will always be people who disagree on subject but that is just the way things are
first people can learn about what is going on around the world
different things are offensive to different people
computers are a relatively new invention they have become very popular
for computers and a great thing
the features of the setting are cool pines and rushing rivers however the cyclist comes to find that the rushing river is not so refreshing
if content in a library is considered offensive should still remain on the shelf regardless
then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride
it has all facilities a good school should havewell furnished classrooms laboratories library and playground
people are different therefore we like different types of things
if you have some spare time you should hang out with them and have some fun go to the mall
this book frankly makes me sick to the stomach
remember computers do lots of things help us learn and they are a fantastic tool
the main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy
everyone reacts to things differently
one way was when he was describing the warmth music and cooking in his house
in conclusion i think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library
having friends so close by you can really make every life great
some people take romances being offensive or comedy or horror
you have to think of others and respect their view of it all as well
is good to research for any projects or school assignments you have
this means that and thousands of others rely on computers for communication with friends and family
it is human nature to fear the unknown
as her mother begins to plant the flower a winter hibiscus she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test
they might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text
she found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get passed the tough times
put these offensive books in libraries then
technology is advancing and were going to have to use a computer sooner or later
getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer
the narration says not like the kind we had
all you could do is download it
they cooked nice food and invited the relatives over to eat
the materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them
even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve children have the choice to pick them up
one reason is that she will have more experience with her new country
allows you to type up anything you want for school
back then there was nothing could do to take his daughter from her mother
so everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public please reconsider
you never know what somebody enjoys doing
my personal view is that i think it wrong to have those kind of books at the library
to conclude although some books are offensive to some people and not to others we have to be aware of what cause problems to certain people
without being noticed
in this book the main character and eventually the protagonist a firefighter that cause fires instead of putting them out
saying that i believe that we should not be able to ban censor or remove any books music or movies from the public
do you know you can enjoy nature anytime
dear a home on your town all you hear is mom mom mom drive me to the library to get books
features of the setting affect the cyclists moods in many ways
just because a person does not appreciate their child picking up a book they should not have
the landscape seems to get more threatening too a ridiculously large shake
i would get so mad i would put the book down and walk away
once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration
passionate music witch he adores today
first our parents read us books to get us to go to sleep
that is what family is about
there are card games board games even games
as a student i know that kids use computers all the time
time to go for a walk jog or bike ride
finally the last reason i believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet
i do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store
this is the fault of an immoral world
the reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive
i believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work
the cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting
i just gave you some reasons why i would say that
oxygen is key to life
it is basically any information in a click
most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive
but this is what i think is right
in conclusion i believe that literature should not be censored from the people
computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer
the airplane took off into the air
she had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it then she could too
first there was the fact of time
not being able to see a real relationship
if everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library
one reason is you can book places that you want to go or the sights you want to see
there is something in each that strikes a spontaneous appreciation
the features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons
a lot of people go online and play games on numerous websites
a second reason why i do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed
in the states also be to read about and how we have a wonderful state
people the computer is something good and cool
so having it for a job is great
there is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface
sure and a lot of others love their computers
the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water
it would teach us to be more intelligent
libraries should remain entirely intact forever
did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich
that night i asked my parents about it and asked if i could read it
most of the topics of books music movies or magazines are helpful
i was visiting a prompt last week
the author concludes winter hibiscus with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life
some things be considered inappropriate as many things are but at the same time each person has their own limits to this
so how can we help to solve this problem
the way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm happy and pleasant mood
students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals
they can see bad pictures nudity drugs and violence
please consider my opinions the right way
when everyone learns to get along maybe then can this problem be solved
overall the main mood of this memoir is gratitude
how many times would china be in the newspaper
offensive entering a you know your are going to find something interesting to readlisten to or even watch
the mood is mainly set by the memories of her environment friends and culture
they make rules just to display their power over students and take away many of their rights
so if you do not want to see or your kids to see the offensive books and movies you should make sure not to go in the adult section
instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips children should be outside on their bikes or swimming or playing sports with their friends
music is not just something you listen to but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book
some people find many books songs movies and magazines offensive
a soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a of a company
offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries these kind of materials should just have rules
for example on paragraph says he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices
he gives them healthy food and keeps the stable clean
it also has a number of storybooks and magazines
so have kids stay away from offensive materials
censorship lies within the hands of the viewer
he learned everything he could ever think about from his parents and he loves them a lot
they make our lives easier with their technology
so why do we need these things
he was looking at a magazine out of library
the mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful
many people believe computers are good for nothing
just hookup your to the computer and instantly say good or hows it going
memories are being stolen by the awful device that computer
dear local newspaper people spend to much time on the computer
because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up
slavery and the were a horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again
must teach for others to learn
also there are other sites where the computer interacts with you
these photos give children negative thought such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model
whether it is a magazine movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another
computers are not only fun but very resourceful
maybe they were being burned because the looked down upon its story and its fictional stories but that does not mean it should be banned from the libraries
you see much of our population spends at least hours a ween on the computer
the shelves would be bare
i would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere but it could educate people on what and what not to do
for me personally home has always been a calm place
all these ways of communicating with people around the world are very beneficial to many people especially those with family or friends living in another town
the message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this
they sacrificed so much for him
computers have been rapidly changing too
grapes of was banded because their was slavery in it
the mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child
all in all we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by
his parents often welcome neighbors and relatives to join the dining
dear newspaper you want people to be so memorized by a computer that they miss out in the world around them
movies like this should be banned from public libraries
this quote creates a calm loving mood because it explains that the author enjoyed his childhood and loved if family who loved him back
but first i want to be educated on where i go
when the geese come back in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding i will take that test again
for most of my childhood i did this and it was very simple
eye protection is important
we dance to it sing to it workout to it and most of all we just enjoy it
with the technology and all the other things children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions
the author also ends with this paragraph because when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding
if i was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me
do you have a picture of your cat
dear leader of the local newspaper i have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society
for example when shes in the greenhouse it takes her back to her childhood it was like walking into another world
no computers no education and you will go and works at or something
i know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on
they take away and diminish time interacting with family and seeing the world
hobbies keep us busy and happy
how would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most if not all materials had been removed
the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated but the man is alone in the desert
with no computers you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine
third communication are going to be a hole lot with computers
they might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing
thirdly they can learn about distant places
to whom it concern i will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside
memories would be when we hung around with friends and family
in conclusion computers are great because kids can get there homework done also its good for video chat finally because the internet is very resourceful
taking it off the shelves for kids is what i think is the right thing to do but not adults
yes books and movies should be censored
the cyclist would appear to be closing in on something to drink but be left with nothing
if all different races want censorship then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people
therefore the computer has so many things that can benefit you and the world with everything it has to offer
it also teaches oodles of information
the theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings
the author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering
i believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read so it will be a message
the hibiscus is budding represents growth
computers is one of mans greatest accomplishments
you can even webcam with people
all of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed
dear the local newspaper i do computers effect people
reading is yet fun but it is also with out being in school
my first reason was that if you don know something you could look it up
from stocks to instant messaging people have based important decisions in their life based on what they have read
maybe other people like that kind of music or etc
in earlier times libraries used to be the place where you went to study
you can also learn or read the news that your missing
people should be educated on the negative effects computers bring
the staircase should be by the circulation desk
second there were short rolling hills and rough roads which made it hard to ride on
books there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written
now people can simply type up an email and hit send
surf you cant online
spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family
as one can see the censorship of books and movies is not entitled to a personal opinion
after reading this essay i hope you realized that computers are bad for you in various ways
in the novel censorship is one of the main themes of the story
libraries are for children and adults of all ages
exercise is something should yet to
if you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer
the cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted but will now look onto peoples sense of directions
when i grow up and soon get out of high i want to travel all over the world
the whole screen thing brings me to my next point
libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature
both of these points are valid but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional
the computer helps us learn of faraway places it lets us communicate with friends and family all over the globe and lastly the computer entertain us
profanity and action are minor types of offense
also i have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve
and we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days
anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else
for example wanted to wish this but when he looked online he saw how just had an earthquake so he changed his plans this
no single person is forced to read a book they are offended by
a personal experience i have was one day friend and i were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report
first of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places people and the weather
there would be chaos and nobody would be able to live or even exist peacefully
i think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with
censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view
these technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends
to most this idea is not a good one
we should neither waste nor pollute water as each drop of water is precious
he is looking back on his childhood and the memories
after everything it does not matter what is offensive to people they will just have to deal with it
well as you see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way
the mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone
i would like to thank you for your time
my last reason why i say that you should spend more time off of the computer is so that you could spend more time with your family
if they have a problem with what their children are reading then they should deal with that personally
many people are always on one of those instead of talking in person
if i was unable to do what i like to do i would probably be angry or depressed
we make the start of great things with these
none tried to stop them
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way
it even be happening in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it
if something is forgotten it is as if nothing happened
feeling lazy she sits down
he reaches his school in time
it is our duty to cooperate with him
like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long
helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on
then he came to a rough road
libraries are found all over the
during a time of segregation this neighbors families and friends stayed united
as you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things
after some time the guard blows the whistle and wave the green flag
would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us
the hibiscus she bought was away to comfort her
there are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries
computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect
i know your thinking that computers could be used for education but humans prefer fun over anything else and i hoped this helped you realized that
my favorite part about the computer are applications like and so many more
if an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid
this clearly violates the and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the
in the essay it states wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke
well its true it can be bad but it matters how you use it
at this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near
they could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf
at this point it maybe too late
i think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries
but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town
theses materials are what keep people connected with each other
a setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking drinking water and worrying that he is going to run out
my opinion is leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read
everyone seemed to be in a hurry
its a new time and age and things are different
you could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer the possibilities are endless
another can people computer spend less time with family and friends i was watching television and playing on the computer
the has the highest number of obese citizens in the world
as the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused
computers especially help out college students
she refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is
the most amazing part of a library is the fact that one choose what he or she reads
they act hyper and mean to other people or even other children
the author has good moods
too much of perseverance is needed to become a real gentlemen
you could even try and make some good health ones that advertise good health for people and teens
if you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school
soon though the terrain changed
another reason is learning
first learning about different cultures helps the world stay together
i would keep all items away from young children at all times if they are not good
the mature content in movies books and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them
however it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study
they improve our minds and awaken our souls
the horizon kept him hopeful and determined
why would you ever censor anything in a library
this concerns some people
sometimes people who we love have to move far away from us
it was july the schools had reopened
the author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family
so use the time on the computer better
because sells your info to businesses
what is supposed to be minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family
to completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them
as an one has the freedom of speech and this applies to media as well
not only should censorship be allowed it should be enforced
then probably on his merry way to his destination
this leads into taking a material or book they see the wrong way and being offensive about it
its almost impossible to keep all children away from these things but we should at least try to
the coolies were moving about carrying luggage on their heads
always stick in your gut
the senior students provide help to the junior students in the hostel
this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood
this comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week
do your eyes tend to hurt when your finally off the computer
the movie situation i understand
now with video you virtually meet the other person showing how lonely and individually separate you can of from others
if people find the profanity in the song offensive then do not listen to it
you can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book
being on the for a while is not a waste of time
without a variety for all would leave everyone less choice
computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money
no i not believe there should be any censorship in libraries
we as a community should love one another and respect them
also the internet is helpful for work
computers are just plain bad
going out into the real world might be hard but it is something that should be done
sometimes you will be bored something to do go on computer
its like drugs they are so easy to get
all the facts of life and the world are put into it
computers help people study learn and even talk to other people
all the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end
it easily allows people to stay educated updated and connected
if it is winter the least kids could do is go sledding
most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another
farmers need water for cultivation
he explained his life home family and parents
everyone in the neighborhood is so welcoming he tells us how his mother always leaves the door open for those who welcome her in
my parents are always staked about me talking to my friends and hanging out with them
do we need computers at home
reading is the key to success
also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left
everyone likes different things
they do not stop playing it because someone having different feelings about the movie
is how people work and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated
people are losing time and everything
wants to go on the computer that day and throws a ten turn the parent should take the computer away for the next and so on and so on
also the author discusses the unity and love between his family and neighbors
literature glorifies colour around us
rafters and timber from my trunk
this adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration
if a person finds a book for example to be offensive they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one
they show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it
they will one day take over
the time it takes an author to write a book is very long
by doing this he expects a better harvest

it is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it
books are not excluded from this rule
these features are the desert the high temperatures and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid
i think people under twenty should not be aloud to check out movies or music
technology was made to make things easier do we should take advantage of it
the bridegroom was escorted to the thronelikeseat on the raised platform
for my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends
this words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself almost familiar to her now
authors use their freedom in their writing just like musicians use their freedom to make music
this can have a very negative affect
he lost hope after that landscape and he pretty much gave up
writers state things that to some degree offend one in a million people
in this last line she comes to terms with her present situation
this shows the culture lurking and dancing through his house of his childhood
computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday
over all the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy although the happiness went on through difficult times like segregation
computers are very helpful to many it gives them an education and they can interact with many people
growing up my parents would watch carefully about what shows i watched what music i listened to or the types of magazines that i looked at
the books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it
from a survey of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis and at baseball then others
they teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned
they help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer
i enjoy reading books about people with special powers such as necromancers
for example if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes would you be upset
dear newspaper i think that when kids or even adults get computers then they would not use it for good causes
however a more relaxing activity could be playing a game with your family or going out with your friends
i understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem but libraries are usually set up in sections
the older generations lived a happy not violent life
they certainly take the best parts of online interaction and put them together
the terrain kept changing making it hard for him not to be thirsty
dear editor of the people say that technology is affecting everybody left and right
computers are wonderful things but when it starts affecting your health and physical fitness they are enemies
he also explained how his parents built the home on their own that he got to grow up in
you must learn to deal with
you can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive
did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone
they also have effect they help business people stay organized
i think that it is bad enough that a lot of teenagers have been exposed to a lot of these things already
the author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow
in the exact same way censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love
picture this scenario if you will a student at has to do a project on the in the
a family that i have been close to my whole life had moved to due to jobs
we are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs
conclusion the computer us with our search for information contact people and make new inventions
before computers so many things we do now would seem impossible
the sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer
adults can eliminate it
dear editor have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important
no at the level and yes at the level
he had resorted to gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth just to keep his mind his thirst
where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself
people all around the world think differently about music books and movies
for example rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
she can simply type the question in on her computer and get hundreds of answers
it will benefit both sides of this argument
not every student employee or other person can spend that time looking for an answer
this device has allowed people do buy things online talk to people online and also provides entertainment for some people
now that you know that lets move on to the last reason
but to your dismay computers do teach hand eye coordination
for example kids are always
nowadays many jobs use computers
society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children
she sees it as being indomitable renewing and beautiful
fer example in he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life
exercising is more important than a computers because it will make you health you will not be sick so much
computer change not only the body but mind
other people like reading about that topic or like that kind of music
they also search for addressed and phone number
so think twice about the negative comments people say about computers
some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it
like for instance music
computers help peoples every day lives and they could be helping yours
some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
if so many kids are getting hurt by the then why do we all keep using computers
and while certain groups advocate to protect the children of from these offensive works the children will still find a way to access them
we pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for to step up and ask for a room
the cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted
one way was because of the

drinking drink after drink never having any water
the books can tell you the story of peoples life and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it
computers open you up met new friends
thank you for your time
not being with the people you love not doing any activities you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life for
my first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others
this hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read
dear newspaper editor are all living in the age of technology
the bright lights of the screen make your eyes unclear state say more people lose eyesight from looking of a computer than they would by staring at a light
but these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends
you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want
through everything they had been through
this is my first benefit of a computer
some people should think that school should not read due to racism in the south
i think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of a libraries
the chances seem bleak
some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it
before computers world spend hours in books and find what there looking for
also student use them to do research for school
well in my opinion i think that they should not remove any books because people think that it can be offensive but other people be into those books
there are many ways to do this
he works very hard from morning till night
there shouldhowever be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or
he wanted to get their because it was so hot
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show she has hope
dear of the you know that computer have been around since the
yes i do because music movies etc
the people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked
moreover you can watch movies online anytime form wide section such as horror romance comedy fantasy or even children films
spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body
if that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section
i think that there are things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book
this happened in the passage
the world is just a click away
computers let people communicate with each other
a third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things
what happens if a hurricane is abroad and a family has no idea of its presence
computers now offer online study groups that can help us get into a college
after an hour of searching i decided on one
the same goes with family
one time my friend was sitting in the computer and she started to watch inappropriate videos when her father found out about this he canceled their internet
you can talk to people on certain websites
what if you are going on a trip but you don know were to then you could use the beloved internet
the sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination
studies show that more adults are on computers playing games than children
these are only some things i can do on my computer
or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff
they enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies
the scorching sun and the extreme heat had made life unbearable
i think that computers have a positive effect on people
those sections were created for a reason
for teenagers keep it educational but be more relaxed about it
parents would also not appreciate if their children were reading or seeing something that they think their child should not be exposed to
dear i believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have
first of all i think computers are good because news travels quickly
even she heard their voices
lastly computers lets us explore new places
you might also learn about nature
there was a mood created by the author in memoir
another benefit of computers is communication
i could not find i had to go on a computer for the information
i think the mood created in this story is love
the ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling
studies show that out of students have computers at home and that person without computer access gets about of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects
do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them
finally inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it
i am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful
society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers
books based on religion or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics
the mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary
it is against the law in some states that a be in school at all
she said she was ill
i think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision
we need the computer for everything if i were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it
many places show and sell offensive material
the world is exposed to offensive material everyday
secondly computers help people learn new things
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered scared thirsty and cause him to worry
if your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities you are most likely going to be upset
they all rotate round the sun
how can you consider what is offensive and what is not
as you can see games learning and talking are easier to do on the computer
it would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night
that brings us in next issue
libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society
its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me
censorship at the library is not needed at all times
also it would be so much better for our bodies and minds to go out and enjoy nature instead
these are probably the is for school
so if they wanted to read a book like that they could probably get it off the internet even if they can not in libraries
but even though it started out good almost nothing last forever
i know this because my eyes start to hurt
the whole lesson will deal glorifying the quick success of an immoral character
my opinion is when you have to for a test quiz or anything if can become boring
like i said be what was friend
then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him
the computer next to the is probably the number one thing that makes people fat
say if you were years old and when computers come out you bought one and went on it every day instead of being fit
the setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men
also most teachers expect an essay to be neat possible
like the title states the setting of this story was a rough road ahead
it also bears fruits generally once a year
i can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time
i hope you made up your mind and decided that all internet access is not a waste of time
well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model
so with a computer nearly impossible not to be able to keep in touch
so you and a lot of others payed for this book and now you want to wast that money
he is a good sportsman
not only does it lower the risk of the letter not getting there but it is also much quicker
i was thinking to myself that oh well i am young and i will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad
first going to tell you some positives about computers
so many books would be lost if someone could write because it was offensive
in my own opinion its a good thing
i hope something i write will propose my reasons
a large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called
if we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library
to find out these answers all you have to do is look them up on the computer
he is also admiring the things they went through such as leaving behind their families and careers in the country they loved
it gives people a chance to understand how the real world
there are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned and future people would not be able to enjoy them
the hard being the kitchen
my grandparents came from montreal to attend my birthday party
next using computers builds hand eye coordination as well
the dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated
so that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library
the last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl its significance
my second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect
it can also help them in anything they want to do
it gives you an understanding of how people use to live
also to conversations are fading
i believe that their are lots of resources
imagine you go into your favorite library and you go to grab your favorite book or movie and its not there
with an understanding of these basic freedoms one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to citizens
books should be something that each person should have a choice in
there will never be a dull moment
therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech
there are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children
removing books means taking away history from them
i believe the author adds this passage to the story to represent determination and
censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong
one solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies
we only have one life so you better enjoy it
they gave up their families friends country and careers all for their son so he could live a better life in the
second its a bad influence
first of all computers are a great source of communication because if you have a long distance relative that lives in then you can talk to them online
but if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature they should be removed for the good of the people around us
what seems to make them so important to us
not only do you just talk to them you could do a webcam chat so you could also see them
i had vocals is a galore to deal with
many jobs would be impossible with out computers
instead of sitting down on the computer all day
well from all over the world are not getting enough exercise because computers
not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials
fresh air trees and birds are much better than a screen a couple clicks and the hum of a machine
some parents censor what their kids read and watchand some do not
books more often are correct
who just so happens to think we should continue slavery
so the experts have no reason to that because people use the computer to keep in touch with families
amazingly computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way
it is all about choices
secondly students can listen to music
made by claims to be the most popular online on the web
you think that it has been checked out but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive
to begin with in the matter of the case should we or should we not remove offensive booksmusic magazines or movies from the library
they once per a day after the sunset
new technology like computers can change the world and help things faster
of them are free too
the author is grateful and proud because her parents welcomed with open arms people of all types
the library staff should not be aloud to choose what books are aloud because if some one has a fine they get money
sometimes even children have to go through it as well
you use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc
in a situation like this computers became essential to everyone
going on a picnic will give you time to get to know new people
the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip
jupiter is the biggest planet among all of them
you can type learn about historical happenings different places and different cultures as well
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show strength and encouragement
in the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake
but is not the only one who talks to relatives on the internet
when the flower is budding it is beginning a new life
in conclusion all of this can only be done with a computer
simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens
it beats faster when we run or walk fast
but when she finds a hibiscus plant it reminds her of her homeland
lastly kids can learn about people from other times
with graph making software you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest
not only will computers impact people but it also impact family in friends
people spend hours on computers talking to people
it could also let them communicate
there is a great noise in the whole building
it would of taken me forever to there so instead i went online and talked to him
of our society works with computers
i think the mood the author set is loving
spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are dangerous to young teens
the doctor will always be needed
but then when i was six my dad got a job that required him to work late every night
you could also play board games hide and seek etc
i think that people exercising more and spend time with family and friends
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
also people use the computer more than they use exercise machines bicycles or scooters
email messages send instantly to anywhere
i believe that the is the most important book in the world
one important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is it takes away our freedom of speech
thank you for listening
we need computers in life to help us do jobs communicate with family or friends traveling the world and for research on homework
people who are on their are away from their friends and family
the memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have which is another mood
now we have the computer
but if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects they will learn the hard way
to hide away words from our children is wrong
with a computer you could research anywhere you want and make that trip the best days your life
why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else
in the present circumstances the future of postmen is not bright
doctors all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life
also you feel that there is nothing you can do to fix it
what is your opinion on reading materials
this excerpt conveys a feeling of nostalgia and warmth as the author praises his childhood home
if he had been traveling in the for example he have been more comfortable
censorship is a law and it is commonly broken
i want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem
he often quarrels with others over small things but soon forgets about it
what if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing
the author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers
books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines
it sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people
not get sunk and it can travel for days with no water
though these are all valid opinions they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves
letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right plain and simple
personally i do not much use public libraries but i often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book
rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills
the author uses words such as warm to describe things
with book you can also like never before
one might think that is good but its slow with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly because of computers
now is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time
it wrong to talk about them that way because it get teens to think it okay for them to do it and nothing bad is going to happen
they might even like it
in this case nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else
sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors
the first reason why i think using a computer is good for people is because you have to look up something on the computer one day
people who enjoy reading the books that are wanted censored would no longer be able to read those books
the plant will grow if it can adapt
my biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer
everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material and censorship makes that impossible
many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive
the last reason why computers benefit our society is
it would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery depressions world wars and homicides
but could it be a bad thing
to be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in
to begin with i wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me
you can also chat with people online
these reasons are knowledge different sections of the library and freedom
then after over coming that a large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
not only that but what one person finds offensive another can not
in the distance a fox playfully chases a butterfly
maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about
for example research and entertainment
either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive
playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer
the features of the setting are that there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
there are many ways in which the setting of rough road ahead affects the cyclist
computers not be totally to blame for the problems stated above
they should have a a good development turds learning
farmers need to keep reports on their money income
a computer is a very helpful resource
shows that of people talk to other people over those websites
if there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink
there are so many forms of chat on the internet etc
prevents that so you can always talk to them
for example fast is like texting
also make sure you eat well food provides a lot of energy
they should be able to go to school and not worry about the book that they grab at the library
books are the same way
the parents point of view makes things a lot worse
the postmen deliver letters in the homes of the addressee or at business places
the mood is mostly calm happy because telling the courage his parents had
it also goes on to say that it was a test for my inner spirit
the facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences
in the evening we play cricket at the school playground
my last reason i think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs
i have long brown hair
that line right there is showing love
the only way i would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right
another can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right
thirdly there is many more options and sites to choose from
there are kids who play them so much all they think about is killing guns and war
most people in have a computer in their home
if you are going to read a book do not get a book that is offensive
going outside is very important to your health
politics and earned a name as an orator
the internet can connect all over the world and you can learn about other cultures
in other words computers can be used for fun
please let the people stay in touch
the water also had the flavor of battery acid
its a fact that you instead other people on computers
many books are an authors experience so they are meant for high school age
you could invite friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to met
you have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the
also in paragraph it talks about the wondrous joining of the different cultures in the neighborhood
others not but they still will be able to see them in there own way
one person can learn so much with a computer
is also majorly grateful for their courage to come to a new world without knowing any of the language or culture just to give their children a better life
and the only i could talk to them outside of school was on a computer
most importantly they are a vital source of communication
it has a long neck and a tiny head
he made me feel like i was invited to his home with open arms and i could feel the environment around me
what would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive
when a person uses a computer they have to keep an eye on the screen but still be able to use the mouse or keyboard
i think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book
the mood created by the author in the memoir was admiration
however is there any difference that we can find unique in india in our attitudes towards parents
the answer is of coarse it can but because people will be people
sometimes good friends who wants to together loss touch or if one friend people can find online and take
the small engine ran on the narrow rail tracks
it is always good to have friends and stay in touch with family
these reasons are why i think computers are a big help in our society
some of the older people think different and others they think the same
another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also
advancement is centered around computers
is also mostly grateful for her parents
its bad for people to be reading those tip of magazines
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
book publishers put only what they want are kids to learn
what one person loves another person could hate
his salary is very low
especially kids should be outside playing and exercising
you can just his name and hundreds of different websites using will came
something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it
my last reason was you can meet people
next this last paragraph can tell you about the whole story
but there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way
think off all the calories that build up without exercise
they me with their lives and these teachings have been the basis of my life
can create an interest in other cultures and shape our opinions discover things about other places
by censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them but also from ideas that might make them think
well you can always checks information online you ever forget
in all computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
no censoring books music movies magazines etc
i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home
it is important for a student to read and the works and
in nature there is always some thing new
one day my plea will be heard
censorship seems like a great idea at first thought
it a snake was in the road then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road
there are countless sites and to name a few the list goes on and on
the computer is surely a great invention
me and my do not like that
in conclusion the mood of the memoir is honesty and truthfulness because the author tells us about things that might make us uncomfortable
for example instant messaging
also if you are not sure about homework or something like that you can just ask a friend to find out
doctors show that of people that spend time more than hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision
that book is public property
the setting was the main affect on the cyclist
you can also learn how to type when you know how to type you can type faster and faster
do i believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
i shall try to be an ideal teacher
they help with school work like projects or email
there is icon inside one of your documents
they use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages
country music for example is very peaceful to me
also you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them
amazingly the computer is filled with knowledge like this
more people should see computers as a positive effect on people
this brings us to our last subject
i understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries but there is a way to stop it
changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it
on the news you hear about obesity
i know this because talks about his family and friends and his
all we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen
what i really want to write about is the computer
he can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do
computers are a fad that will never die out
another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows
the author did a great job fixing these into the story to make it flow very well
be the smart and well educated people
some people believe that a movie or song needs to be removed but others disagree and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away
from my point of view computers don benefit society
second are many solutions to try out before taking an item away
modern city life is just like a contest with so much of rush and stress
when the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms he had an overwhelming urge to seek out kiss them and buy some bait
and even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions
kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories
everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch
it can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you
well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days
many people think they should
nature is beautiful and refreshing unlike a computer
everybody needs friends that are there for them and computers are the perfect conclusion for that
books should be censored at all
if you take off one book you might as well take off the rest
no one forces us to check out this book or that book
i am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book
trust me i got addicted to a game before
the quote show the loving caring and gratefulness expressed in the memoir by the author
many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others
however two in three wont do so
what you a room notebooks that you buy of or a single computer with tons of space and back up
a library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views
whatever the user wants is a text and a click away
they both have some of the same characteristics like chatting to your friends updating your status every now and then uploading pictures songs etc
from many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries
this means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused
he becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged
he read five books and only got a half a page notes for his assignment
if it can help a driver turn his wheel faster or hit his break i think that hand eye coordination could help that driver stay out of an accident
personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today
people can not just take the books out because it offends so many people
also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired
dear local newspaper i think computers have affect on people because firstly it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places
no because the helps in a lot of ways too
i have a friend that moved to last year
so the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first town as he calls it in the essay
the mood also sounds very loving because he loves his parents for moving to
and it seems that computers are addictive
it had words that i never heard before and i got confused
nobody is forcing to read that specific book libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books
nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of love oceans with pink sand
firstly you loose interaction with family and friends
computers are a good way to help with your skills
this is a book that at my age i should of never came across
even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year
in short the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole
i myself have not come across any books movies or music that have offended me
had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it
using the computer this way is another terrific idea
i could not understand the reason behind it
we should all understand that computers are a huge advance in science and they are a great help and also fun
he was given back roads that are abandoned now
when the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere
every student gets a take home project at social point in the time of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils
sometimes these things should not be on the shelves
the hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring this shows that winter is its weakness
with the internet people are able to read almost any book right on their computer
you are just too young for this book
they always had there door open for friend and family and most of there friend would go over every night
the shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book
it only takes minutes ti check your or look up something
i blame myself for picking up in the first place
this is found when the author says at some point tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke
why should we have to suffer anymore with uncensored books at the library
stuff like that i can understand because that can be personal reasons
they make you a welldisciplined person who obeys the leader and the rules
every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades
ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then
they show and teach us about history
she is used to the flower being in a warm environment
the school can have a bad image from the students
it is much easier in remember someone address than it is a phone settle for just talking when you can actually see the person
the computers are like by matter the most in life to being more focused on them
if libraries start to ban books music movies magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read
if not properly exposed to something there is absolutely no way to be prepared to encounter it in the future
it became hilly and very inconsistent
information on anything is always on the internet
in the classic novel by the protagonist struggles through life in a world antagonized by the banning and burning of books
i the culture and how you need to appreciate what you have
although some stories seem like a bad option it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out
people will always take things offensive
i hope you understand this better
but a lot of people use computers almost everyday
computers can be used just for fun too
plants and flower brought back memories of her homeland
while in present day less than of all children get at least one hour of time outside
also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands
what should we do people ask and she says well take away the
if you could please take the information i have given you and think about it it would be greatly appreciated
well you should really consider thinking about this those cant even reasons the people in the
the things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk
if you were hungry and hot but nothing was near you this could make you hot
but he keeps trying to reach his destination
how did do with his idea he failed miserably
thank you for your time
also the author is saying that when the seasons change things change
there are people out there that think somethings should be taken off the shelves or not even made
computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available
they also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet
in this story they mention her helping her mother in the garden
computers and other technology make the way easier
he can use the computer to help him find that phone number
just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework
water had gathered there
the narrator has a bunch of good thoughts about his mother and father
another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library
i believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what
also you can watch movies episodes and videos
the child learn something new from the book
when authors publishers song writers or movie producers release these items they do not think of the surroundings
having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not
when an author must take this into consideration
dear local newspaper of own computer
in addition computers give us the power to learn about faraway places
i know that for rated movies there is an age limit but for explicit books i do not think there is an age limit
let these young adults read about everything they are interested in
less time on computers would also time outdoors
i seen so many materials that i think are not proper for people under age to been looking at
some music today is just extremely bad
although i do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it
but there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter
he tells how people always came over to house for dinner and there were many celebrations
they are certain books music movies magazines that people find quite offensive
later on they feel guilty
no i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive
magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child
this benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running
it also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again this could have a double meaning and mean that the authors life will bloom again
once you begin to play games on the computer there is not turning back
just as the winter that killed the plants ending life the spring will come and start anew
it distracts people from their life
dear newspaper in my opinion i think computers do benefit society
thank you for your time
my opinion is no actually heck no
as you can see there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important
doing so will not only help libraries but also society
its just not worth it
it shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again
he took advice from old people to do it
whenever i look in magazines i just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes food and people
his troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp
computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way
so when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map
these advances in computers can also allow people to learn worldwide information
they have the same right to have those books movies and magazines on the shelves as you do
in my opinion i do believe that computers are good for you
i was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean
coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man
that means that project should be real easy
you can almost feel how grateful he is for is happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the writing
she will be more confident
during this memoir he is very excited and thankful for the family he has
exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit
that way you are happy and so is everyone else
an other reason why the computers are good for society is educations
so much color is splashed on all eyes and ears on such sights and sounds
the mood show that the author had a great childhood and loved his neighborhood very much
and the growing realization that i would die of heatstroke
everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite
in conclusion the reason why people should not spend their life on computer because they think they will be entertain by technology instead of interacting will their family
make sure that they know the difference between good and bad right and wrong
the one you love could be messing up because of the that you have in your house
please listen to my reason why the computer effect people lives
luckily in our own era i do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries
the would have full control and knowledge would not be blossoming in the schools
computers cause you to isolate yourself
it is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers
dear local newspaper has been a discussion around the for decades now
keeping in mind that not everybody likes to read books they just find reading magazines and watching movies interesting
think for a moment about what you like
however they could of turned out differently if they just shut down their computers
i think that most people would be mad at the schools or the libraries because they got them
it took me seven days to learn
in the essay he states i noticed the terrain changing
on the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children
the i think that is because when your computer crashes or breaks you would most likely know what to do to fix it
the effects are positive because your brain is challenged and your boredom has vanished
if they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone
books are not the only things that might offend some people
a man find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him find the book funny and joke about it
we must take a stand and alter statistics for the better
everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read
in the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his child hood home
it is wrong to make fun of or joke about people
kids might need the material that is offensiveit could help them through life
i strongly believe that computers are bad and people spend to much time on them
it ended up being scary for another reason as multiple uncensored sex scenes were displayed throughout the first couple minutes of the feature
last reason why i that we should use computer is because sometimes have to go on the for example you had important message the website and you message you
as you can see computers are incorporated into our daily lives
look at what computers can do
from slave states to all free states
all these reasons will lead to the below
my family also uses the computer to order
she now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories as her old love did
people all have their own opinions all media can be learned from and our freedom should not be restricted
this shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over
i recently attended the wedding of a friend
lastly computers are doing more then good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy
i clicked many pictures there
people hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said
a can cost anywhere from to even that is a ton money
the first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town
it opened my eyes to see how great it is to reacts your own goals
this is found around us every day
inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids
also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country
another example would be the series
well i because it gives us the information we want to see
the thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together
finally computers are great for learning a new language
if children want to see or read this material they should get permission from their parents first
if books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well
a library is a sanctuary for people to go read their favorite books for free containing books from all types of genres
also of those provide reliable correct information
families that are separated because one have moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another and because of computers they can
my father went to drop them back home
i think there should be censorship in libraries
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
i understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material
the first mood that is shown is a loving mood
they also give the ability to learn about far away places
by ripping our computers from lives of workers chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences
think about it how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact
teachers are known to be the second parents
parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to
but some of their family and friends are to lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer
his mood is high and her has confidence
they control life in the major part
this affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park
there is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely
in books magazines shows movies on the you name it
this is a reason why he is very limited on water supply
find about without the expense of a plane ticket
this led to many bake sales and fund raisers
we should destroy the computers
play a game like monopoly or play
the kids of today and tomorrow know what is out there and how to stop the minor
and that the end of your world comes when you make it so
for the reason people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside
therefore the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show change for the better
there are only a few reasons why i think that people should have access to offensive materials
of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator
for example when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to he said i have my own map
not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
magazines also offer a source of learning
people on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer
“the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated”
the setting led to her deteriorating health
it really make miss out on half of their day
reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life
this could a leading of obesity
computers are helpful device
censorship is not good for any society
many people complain to the when they come in the libraries
it also means she will be well prepared and will have a list of confidence in passing this test
they need to go out and enjoy nature
his parents arms and doors were open at all times for anybody needed to get back on their feet
there are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad
no i do not believe that libraries should censor anything
these things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers writers and musicians
first reason that computers are positive is that it can help you with your education
this means that books magazines movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive
a library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted
adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or any other role model use inappropriate behavior
the mood created by the author in this memoir is lovable
once you gain all that weight it is very hard to get rid of it
most of the kids are fit
some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people
if you do not want your children reading or hearing certain things then tell them so
they gave him a feeling of confidence and physically cooled his body down
dear editors of the morning my sister wakes me up to go to school
yes there are books out in libraries that are offensive to a group of people but that does not mean take that material out of the library
the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower she will adapt to the terrain and toils of
i think the internet is a great thing and it puts a effect on many people
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very warm with lots of love
books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something
advances in technology are great
secretly left his house and went because he was curious
when she sees it she remembers her past and is sad
traveling or even talking walks to enjoy nature can help
in addition my neighbor had to do a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers
the mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy
with the new technology people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out memos
however they should not be censored just because they seem offensive
we can not try to please everyone but it will never happen
in paragraph it shows that he is thankful
but computers cannot simulate fresh air and exercise
the soldier must be ready to overcome any difficulty
in conclusion censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong
this is just one example of how social networks are helpful
if you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse
there is a movie out now that is rated and is extremely scary
these books that we leave behind influence the future of our society
everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them
he kept going though the heat was outrageous and dehydration beginning to overcome him
what offends someone not offend someone else
also talks about how lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world
finally computer is a great way to keep busy
he said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice
when you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive just put it back on the shelf and move on
because you wake up looking at you everyday and love you everyday and take care of you everyday
you need to change something for a paper it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over
computers give us a way to communicate with long distance friends and family
certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries
with millions of different websites the internet has endless possibilities
computers are one of the great inventions we have
that percentage is expected to grow to in the next years
they benefit mankind by forming alluvial soil but they also cause tremendous havoc to human life and property
there is no doubt obesity is a problem and computers are making it worse
books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future
do you find that to be fair to our rights
they can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author written it this way
the setting had everything to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke
you can talk to people the faraway you lose
therefore are having a negative affect on society
they might find a book offensive but does that mean everyone else is offensive by the book as well
the cyclist is affected by couple different things
lastly the rough road affected the cyclist
there is the oldies country jazz hip hop an etc
everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are
can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place
students need to use that certain information in a classroom
that is not healthy for anyone
then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move
one obvious reason for this evil is illiteracy poverty and unemployment
i hope my three reason can persuade the local news paper to agree with my position that computer have a positive effect on people
now with more technology coming out like cellphones and laptops kids would rather hang out with their friends and not with the families
what have you been taught
another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming
uploading family pictures from your last vacation
the mood created by the author of the home blueprints of our lives is love
emails researching questions on the world around us
no one wants to settle for less or no frosting and they should not have to
we want to good guys to win
everything from check out isles at the grocery store to coffee makers at home are being upgraded all the time
all things have a story to tell
this made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless
i conclusion using a computer moderately is a lot better then using a lot
there five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy
a lot of their family lives close by and they often spend time together usually for meals as it says in paragraph
well if you ask me i think does
the authors setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding
on the world wide web you can meet some new people who not live in your state or country
in the essay do not exceed posted speed the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation
the last reason is to get rid of the materials
book tend to be censored and even banned at schools
so has been around for a long time and still is being used everyday and always will be
for example scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch
the answer to that would probably be sit down in front a computer all day
there would soon be nothing left
i think that it is should be left alone the way it is because it put that way for a reason
computers have allowed over citizens to get their education right in their home at a price they can afford
first comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess second comes the downfall of humanity
would you really want to take that from the people
thus advances in technology will give the ability to learn about far away places and people
computers have a positive and helpful effect on people
the computer is often used for projects essays which is important
you can get directions off a computer
another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world
please take side and think that computers have a positive effects on human society
dear newspaper has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much
he finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink
there are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are
the road was also rough plagued with many rolling crippling hills
they must learn the good from the bad sometime
when you loose your connections and become you will use your computer more and then will become worse
also says that of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio
the same rules apply with books and music
in truth the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that
some peoples might be talk to their family members
i want to talk about interacting with family and friends
as we all know everyone is different and have their own interests so they should be able to find the book music etc
even if its just having a conversation do it maybe it can show them that you really care
the authors of the books or items did not
my friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework
although there were a lot of inconveniences yet the people were very happy
kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results
without a doubt computers make it easier for us to communicate with other people no matter how far
the book enclosed many horrible acts against black people
my second reason is that computers help with education
the man was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
that is why these materials should remain on the shelves
he also rides the galloping horses
you can play all the music you want
computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do
at times it is contributory and times the entire expenditure is borne by him
because of computers talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away
so these i the easiest and fastest way to project
not only can you gain weight or lose weight just by being on the computer
you can connect with old friends and talk to current ones
it also makes a great teacher of about any subject as well
the author is happy remembering memories which are not unhappy or unpleasant
battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist
which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at less one person who thinks something is offensive in someway shape or form
most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing
like what kind of clothes they wore food they ate place the lived in
the main mood is thankful
some have problems and some of the books can help them
this reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well
they should be locked up
i agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library
this proves that certain items like books movies and music should not be taken off the shelf
you just have to be over to go in that area and with an adult
not only have computers helped kid but they also help adults
dear local newspaper are you spending all your precious time on a computer
computers give people a place to interact with others
it was very hard to bike in these conditions and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going
the speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a heatstroke which could slow him down
kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves
students can now type out all assignments some schools even give laptops to students to use throughout the year
saving money and enjoying good entertainment are both positive effects on people and both offered by computers
typing on the computer is a lot different from talking in person
another way of getting fit than to sit is going out for a run
say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting i would still be able to write it and sell it
have you looked outside lately
reading is an important thing and whether or not the reader likes it they will come across one that offends them
i know that i have made friends over the years that have moved away and that i have lost touch with
some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it
he called it a substance it had a flavor of battery acid
in such a diverse society clashing opinions are unavoidable
when the reminders of home come and give her strength she will have the power to take the test
it affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water
music should not be as much of an issue as books
this shows that many children are on a computer too much
she wants to take the test again change to see if over time things have changed
i had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly
dear i remember when i was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves
she advises them to work hard and study
they are being rated suitable for all ages suitable for children and older and rated suitable for people and older
not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately
so libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences
libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information
learning about cultures is very important because if people travel they need to know how they can respect each other
dear newspaper you know what computers are doing to the people of the
another way is to have an adult monitor what the child gets from the library
the choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist
in conclusion computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal
if their the age of fourteen and up then they can get a magazine
when the malignant being is the government itself
already upset about failing her driving test the main character is upset missing her homeland
the library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker
like which country is which
also on this short cut he almost runs out of water
also with a computer you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal
it seemed very difficult as i kept falling
i think the author wanted to show how she gained respect for herself in the end of the passage
but libraries today has be way more improved and advance with musicmoviesand etc
for people that are more vulnerable to those situations or seeing those things it could greatly help with some people and show them that it is not right
without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or text message
so i went online on and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in minutes
the mood that was created the is a happy loving mood
she felt hopeless miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland
in almost every school all over the country students use computers on a daily basis
you could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location
however you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact
finally spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends
so take my opinion into consideration
what do you think about books
older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials
then when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over
thirdly family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should
well in conclusion i agree with the fact that because of the fact that people have computers makes them lazy and do not interact with their family
computers can teach you a lot
people have different views believes and religions and books on these might be offensive to some but the life style of another
computers help us learn and communicate
at the beginning of his journey the cyclist is relaxed and the features of his environment
you can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by
but some have content that are not suited for children
it seems that people are getting fatter every day
i think that everything in libraries are very important and who is to know that everybody wants this to happen
young children are often daily visitors of the library
in censorship in libraries should be able to post or shelve anything they want
on top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition so you had to watch for rocks in the road
my tutor comes to teach me maths for one hour
the lioness does the most of the hunting
she says that she will try again
that is their lifestyle and their opinion
everyone has their rights and if writing music and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access
there are many setting that affect the cyclist
it carries the load and draws carts
by saying he was doing when it should have been
hearing the waves laughing ocean waters and feeling it cool as the is just heaven
the sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers rather than enjoying the day
the main reason i disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children
the reason being is because by the material that might show offense to an individual might just be very interesting to another person
secondly the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a ridiculously large snake
but when they are not expected they cause until misery
they would not be able to show off what they really like
a lot of times in families instead of spending time together
all they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise
these electronic wonder help us and our planet in some many ways
one snows day in i was assigned a research paper on
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
i think that at least of people would try this
so i think talk online or using the computer is important
com if that was have gotten a zero on the homework
were did you turn to
so when you watch a movie to listen to music and think it wrong someone right around the corner think that its just normal
then who is an picks up the same book and reads all about the and how they treated their slaves
secondly magazines are an advertisement
computers give people the ability to learn about far away places
interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life
this way other people can read these books
they can talk to each other but most of all see each other
what if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff in a little writing
this time is very pleasant
first you should always be happy no matter what culture your in
students use computers for information on school reports in or
for example a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help
this is because everyone from the most to the least intelligent people have their opinions ideas and hard facts in a computer on the web
mr david and the members of his family are very cooperative and helpful
this shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others and how much others cared for them
heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability
it is also important to that they can keep in touch with friends after school hours
they also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him
the computer today is such a great thing to have in your house
could use the computers for
i think computers can help in life but not to be on for like eight hours
but she does not have the mane
i think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections and my views on the censorship of
whether the lack of water the hills the tumble weeds all are things that affect the cyclist
yes students should go exercise but all the time
the setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions
first how would the book help others in the long run
in school libraries the majority if not all of the library is devoted to children or teenagers
if you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude
people have a choice of what they want to buy and rent
finally really do benefit society because you can use this technology in middle school high school and through college
opinion is that censorship should be left up to the parents of the children that are reading listening to or watching materials
she was still too shaky to say at home she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up
although they use computers for a good reason people should make time for outside
you can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events
therefore we should only view what would be considered just to all
i had the same reaction
cant afford the newspaper
my cousin is now and he used online dating and met this really sweet and pretty girl that lived nearby
an ideal citizen is a valuable asset to society
for example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough rocky ground
this is what i think the computers effects have on people
even if you use a computer to chat with people it still is no replacement for the real thing
now many of the following generations will never get to read that classic because people took it out of libraries
your family and friends last longer than that
if you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect
the point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works
even though to say people who are on the computer often are shy in person
i think that computers have a good effect on people
although these are all underlying problems in the censorship system it seems to all lead back to the parents
exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life
that is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that
in this article i am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days
please get back to me with your thoughts on this issue within the next three days by email
the mood that the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness
some experts say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that be true to some people its not true to everyone
because that would mean the libraries would be gone
above all i hate all those persons who indulge in antisocial and antinational activities
i have one because i like to chat with my friends
the author explains how he had his birthday with his friends and family
this is very urgent situation so please be aware
these two subjects bring me to my last reason if people cant find what they want
war books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be
experimenting that is a choice on your own
because he is unsure of the path he is on he begins to panic a little
books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world
they would let people stay at there house if they needed help or if they had to rest
using the internet world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds
the flower represented the light and hope for the future
furthermore computers are great for all kinds of research and directions
the mood the author created in this memoir is very happy and relaxed
music on the other hand is very important to teens these days
he sets a very specific mood in this memoir which is everyone coming together
this is what my family did on our vacation to and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online
these magazines and books could also be seen as informing
of my family also live far away
normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them
not getting work done is not the problem
last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends
lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference
so why fight when the world was meant to be at peace
do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death
many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely
dear local newspaper the years computers has been a great invention
for communication entertainment and school projects
it would be rather nice to develop courage to lead a simple life and determine to do good work
when i went to a skate board demo at skate lair i had tons of fun
my views on the censorship of libraries is that there should not be any of it
nearly eight feet high
my third and last reason is to be organized
some kids will try and get around them so there is not helping them
once having that item in their grasp they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found
with more miles to gothe cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive
is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age
the material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life and people find that wrong then it means they do not experience life
people do not exercise enough strain their eyes and have less interaction with real people
the effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing
at one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done
the features of the setting in rough road ahead negatively affect the cyclist
lets say a family is planning a vocation to
they allow people to talk online
dear post computers are an advance in technology in a good way
i think that computers help society learn and helps people to talks to others around the world
newspapers give us knowledge about many things of the past and present
everyone knows that family comes before everything
in our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes
there have been arguments over it so severe that it has went to court
especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them
the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain
others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers which sometimes takes away from outside activities
there is a question that ponders in my mind
the cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him
computers are not that bad
instead of using them we could be getting the right amount of exercise and spending it with family and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings
does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages
the hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store the geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter
usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools but they are missing the point
considering the freedom of speech one can express
they are good at students too
if a child does something wrong he is generally excused
with the computer you can access multiple sites
computers are very important to people who work with them
rather the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals
well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a
its a great way to get fit rather than typing and clicking away at your
for example half of my family live in and my mom uses internet to communicate with them
happy because the change the simple house to a home
the mood created by the author is very welcoming
why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more
she plants it when she gets home and vows to take a driving test again
she is ready to try the test again
four of us reached there three gents and one lady
that is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic
what would happen you could be at a hospital for a ride home for an hour longer than it should have taken
but if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam
computers do not help you brain they can make you fat and for a lot of people they cause drama
song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men
also there are many people that find the offensive
there are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others points of views
there is going to be more good books for a person than bad books
instead of endlessly searching through phone books you can just type in their name and you bound to find somewhere on the internet
other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today
they made paper boats and started floating them
radio books movies magazines would all be uncensored
now a days you can do anything on a computer
in it is banned because of animals talking
for example breaking in homes killing people and high sacking cars
we should always think carefully before acting
depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events which you cannot find books at the library
lastly you will have the best feeling ever you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot
i rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face
this explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around because there was nothing out there to at
you can search and get information
out of students use the computers to do homework
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love sacrifice
after all her sadness within the story she finally gets the energy back to tell herself keep trying
the cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse
first kids and even adults can talk to there friends online
however there are all different kinds of books music and all the other materials that could offend all different kinds of people
dear newspaper i disagree that computers are important to people because they have research online colleges and online stores
though the materials found in a story be horrific to a parent it be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people
also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy
the library is there for knowledge and entertainment
first besides books we have magazines
for instance he makes it to this town a guy swore was there but it turned out to be abandoned
but these people are the people who are unfriendly mean and sad
it is simple if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books do not read them
he killed many people destroyed many shops and probably even sold a lot of drugs
in this generation everybody is rushing and computers
then they all get very depressed
he encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up
in their the world they will be able to do this on computer
this could not work in our society today
there is happiness because he was just born
i usually play for a couple hours
we should be able to communicate to our friends and family out of people in our school think having a computer is good
i will collect small things nearby and will build a nest a top of a tree
since we are all different
further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time
but no matter what you try to do something bad will be out there waiting for you
keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental health
my home offers affection security and happiness for my life and i am very round of my home
a problem with kids playing these games become addicted to them and will play for hours
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening
these are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye
censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for
the conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him
that same day i came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing
the world cannot afford to censor
in all that i hope that i made a good point and hope you feel the same way
but where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access
you would forget to at least go for a jog discover new thing
the internet offers virtual tours of places like the of even places can be explored without stepping foot out of your house
i will never forget this trip in my life
flat roads hills building all are settings that affected the cyclist
he wears khaki uniform
the computer device is one of the many devices used for communication
today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves
these are my three reasons why we should spend less time on computers
computer can anybody who uses it
computers make work easier and neater
he takes help from the teachers
they are out in the world and and there is nothing that you can do to stop it
if we remove books that be offensive to one we are taking away that opportunity for others
with this concluding paragraph i believe that she will be more comfortable at the time
criminal acts vulgar language and more
this tells you that the road is very rough
in the story there are many reasons to suspect shy she ended the story with that paragraph
like everything is going to be alright
people today are too worried about other people
little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn
only can change a heart
the hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes
i think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored
you can even be really social and meet new people as long as your safe
and the guy dad invited to come was
there are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby
the mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood
the author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story
people especially children forget the risks of physical health
as well as the library the movie store and everything else
whether the music movies magazines etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you
this is something we hear everyday
there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library
just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring
i hope i pass my driving test the first time just like i did the learners permit test
dear local newspaper are computers really as great as they seem
computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently
instead of being on a computer for or hours or maybe even all day getting fat
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
all because of a movie or book
except the fact about the games i agree with that bad side
exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm
so the time has come to make a let your kid be lazy on the computer and get into or go have fun with them
my conclusion is that people should not to be able to get off of computer
not everything can be just peachy kin all the time
dear local newspaper i strongly think we should have no more computers rather then looking on the computer
like i said computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today helps us communicate with others around us or in
and always remember what the is
my uncle has a horse that runs like the wind
for the things people find offensive i believe they should just simply stay away from it
thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere
i like playing games and editing videos so i got an outstanding graphics car that has outstanding speeds for rendering videos
when people are on computers they focus on whats on the computer and not about their surroundings
the last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students
he had to attend many periods
computers help us to learn in school and outside of it
you have the same belief and understanding as me
this also with focus and people with better focus excel in school work and their social lives
the in our cars are computers we would be lost without them
the cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst
when they ended the story i thought to myself how nice it ended
school children should try to become gentlemen someday
not two miles into this next reaction of ride i noticed the terrain changing
people should stop spending so much time on computers
flip a coin heads tails you pick heads stop surfing the web to get info on that place
i believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library
it is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there
seeing politics and daily news to the weather
more and more people are making less effort to see people in person
computers help tech you things entertain you
but its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it
for as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons
this could be about any subject matter however
in this memoir i think the mood created is very peaceful happy and homely
if libraries were to start censoring their books then the result would be a small selection of drab emotionless materials
the author writes to tell people a story whether good or bad he or she wanted to get that story out there to inform people
i think this because when was talking throughout the story talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are
how are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp
that is why it is good to have a computer
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way
the cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage
the material also should be removed if it is offending someones race
the author creates a grateful mood
these are only three of the main moods in the story
computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society
this are my three reason i think people should not stay on the computer all day
the mood is grateful thankful throughout the memoir
some take offense to that
she vows that in the spring when the hibiscus is budding restarting its growth cycle she will restart too and retake the test
then i will take the test again
such as talk to friends play games even turn off your lights
you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you
in conclusion the authors sets a very sweet inviting mood by adding details of how joyful and enjoyable his childhood was
i waited and waited for the dog to go but it remained there
dear of the has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not
due to the fact they never left their porches
you never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you
if you chatting with someone you can still chat with another person
in this article talks about a young man named and how his life was from then and now
unfortunately it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world
over all in the memoir of the mood can be mainly described as grateful towards his parents heritage and home
would you really want to use something that bad toward your health and your privacy
art should not be censored at all
though i kept falling i did not give up
a library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want
it not be completely accurate
this shows the author is grateful for his parents endurance to come to
first i think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get tutored
the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph of the story for several relevant reasons
for example i know of many online colleges
i do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book magazine or movie offensive
without music there would not be any fun in the world
the motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before
next i believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries
if it had been up to him he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world
you can even buy the game systems
will i disagree with what you say
all they care about is their own family
these are my three reasons why you should not stay on the computer the more you the more you will want to stay
should certain materials be removed from our library shelves just because it has uncensored materials inside of it
i went to the computer for
this is how the setting affected him
and you can go online dating
on the other hand it also helps with your education
it has very tall legs and a long neck
making the family feel back at home made them feel happy
libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things
to some this be one of the best books ever written
well now many things can be ordered offline
then people get pulled in
an online poll was put out on which asked how people regularly talk to friends or family
with all the time spend on a computer in a stuffy dark room how will our bodies be maintained properly
as he came to the first town he describes it as a ghost town having no water and no human contact for some time
par this gives the memoir a sweet mood the author shows his happiness and gratefulness for everything his parents had done for him
so you should watch out because the computer is the only place you can lie
friends always find something fresh to admire and appreciate in each other
if i was to send a message to some of my friends in through it would take seconds
its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days
so as you can tell computers affect health socializing and even mentality
another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water
there is also a nice bakery shop just outside the market
virtual sports be fun but they keep you from the real ones
if i were the principal of my school i would ensure that the laboratories were well equipped
they also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects
we all use them for communication entertainment and knowledge
censorship holds back the voice of society and the thoughts of everyday people
last up can talk online
if it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it my dad would have had a little chat with that library
the days are getting shorter lets live it like
finally computers play a huge part in warming because of the fact that they are so popular
so should they be removed
shes trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to adjust
everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book
the changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health
cyclist are in very good physical shape
in the beginning she refers to her new home as walking into another world
what would that person do
all of a sudden it becomes dark
the text states that it was yet another old friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers
if a certain artist or actor is offensive to them they should find something else and leave that or movie for someone else to enjoy
it you have realized that computers do benefit people
so computers are very popular in many areas computers are helpful in news communication and entertainment
do you have computer at home that you go on
now what will you why you that side
we have to wear white or cream cotton shirts lightblue trousers black shoes and white socks
four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play
all other cars could be seen running far behind
she talks about how her parents helped others of their kind which made her what she is today
but she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord
nature holds natural wonders like the the and the
he gets up early in the morning and goes to his clinic
my doll is a beautiful teddy – bear
in past experiences i have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting
you can do many things on the internet
it is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place
this will help us all because we want to learn about new things talk to new people and see new places
not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life can entertain you as well
some company joined to make one together
my point of view on this topic is simple
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit the setting effects the cyclist in the story
every one is either texting someone
the bullies get into that person head and cause them to hurt themselves because they let people get to them
we have come to the conclusion that we need not want but need computers in our life
censorship is a terrible practice masquerading as a boon
music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands
i support this because computers can let you talk to people that are faraway from you
how would i get along with these students
then his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state
the author considered his neighbors family also rather than just his parents and brothers and sisters
i hope that this letter informed you more about computers
this problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue
this is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by
a few years ago my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up
on thanksgiving my mother was upset because she missed them i was then able to set them up in a video chatroom so my mom could talk to them
it is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole
he had to leave and go back to
this passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence
thank you for your time
do you see the difference
she needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country
another mood is humble
out either have no backyard or have nothing better to do
a lot people can talk for hours on the computer and that is what takes up their time instead of going outside
a instance of this is i began breaking the ride down into distances
your body need water to work right
dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water
this quote means that his parents mood was careful and do anything for people if they needed help
if people are against they need to worry about themselves and just leave alone
also teaches you homework that you did
parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch read or listen to
some kids enjoy reading adult books
it is your choice to not listen to it
censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries
in the essay each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way
two days later they died because they had some disease and no one knew until it was to late
i believe it is unfair that his paper was rejected
libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible
reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option
and how i think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better
if everybody were able to take books out of a library just because it was offensive would we have any books at all
plus act would be completely unconstitutional
while one reader love the story and wear out the pages another get halfway through and never finish it
i think computer will help us learn and do things faster
if the person spoke fluently in and than he or she could teach you
kids and adults both go on computers
books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them
to be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement
eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc
when the hibiscus has blossomed her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin
my father took me there by car
the mood created by the author in the memoir is emotional
scary movies can give children nightmares
the for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together
the way that the person is feeling is a big part on weather they try hard or they do not worry about it too much
as you can see computers are only going to get better
so many teens read that book and found it interesting
but i being a student of class ix did not have to face that difficulty any more
this is why the camel is called the ship of the desert
the cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water
just yesterday i found out that the human body can not survive without its liver
no one can say what offends everyone
it also make our work neater
books should be censored if they are made for children
the author chose to end the story this way for several reasons
suddenly i heard a noise in the street
i hope you understand that technology is not everything in life
they also put the news on there website
that would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries
he this means that he needed water so much and the hill was so big that he needed water
after seeing the sign a snake crosses his path
i think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her and she probably will pass the test
i would help develop the allround personality of all the students
i did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late
so women just had a baby she is using her computer to work online
this winter hibiscus
in fact one out of fifty books contain racism
in conclusion computer can help you save money and help you learn
she is the healthiest person i know and rarely spends anytime on the computer
the scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert
it can be more helpful than you could imagine
also his family was always happy
the road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way
i know when i get bored i go on the computer and play a game called
the terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water
computers are used for research socializing and almost all of our work is done on computers
i know they can but can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem
they are twins so they like the same stuff so they both enjoy killing people in games
also taking the test in the spring symbolizes starting over when everything is new and she has overcome her winter
whenever there is a knock at the door we rush to open the door
lastly the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life
one example that describes this is from paragraph
if a librarian finds something offensive he or she not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material
every one is going to disagree about something in there life time
online gaming has become an sensation and not only an and and can game too
his journey does teach you though that trough determination you will be rewarded
people nowadays are becoming smarter and smarter
who can say what is offensive to everyone
in conclusion people should have limited time on computers
according to a health magazine tests shows that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose your brain cells
this way she found a fun place and left the country for week
i think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material
you say that it will only take a minute and then you with type the article
it helps us to know the results of our actions
help them pick out a book
with such a high risk of being mislead the world needs as much information and thought as it can get
the downsides of the internet
are you good at sports but would like to be even better
very big trees looked very small
yes i think that some books should be taken out of all libraries
if you meet someone you made friends with on vacation you can email them
the geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle
all we can do hope our children does turn on the radio that tuned into that crap and say that sound like good music
what then will they have to read
there is not a point to it
the camels carry the people’s food goods water and other
the listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves
what happens when a child wants to know more than she does
computers inspire people to learn and see different places and lead them to something important one day
nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family
we check news on computers some people even use their computers a and watch important shows
statistics show that people who are using computers excessively tend to have drop in their grades
also i firmly believe time should be spent with your family doing family activities and eating dinner with your parents
life is built on hopes and aspirations
it goes from flat road to rolling hills
another reason that a computer benefits society is ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live to far away
well with the computer and internet access you can easily contact them through great social networks such as
if the libraries do have books that are offensive they do a good job hiding them from me and other kids
as long as he thinks about his death there is only more death
the variety of subjects in a library such as songs magazines and everything else in the library is huge
there are some details of why i think the mood of this memoir is happiness
you are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book
when he finally reached a place to get a drink he was finally satisfied
online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give
ever since the computers have been used as an ad for new information
they should just keep an eye out of what kids are looking at
i have met a obese child
to conclude i implore you not to try and change the habits of others
if you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that not be offensive at all
the person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more
libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction
another reason i think its such a lead idea is you do not get to enjoy nature
there are thousands of books in a library and hundreds are written every single year
if everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate do you think there would be any books left
they read newspapers and magazines
most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe
that is why i think that you can work on the computer
computers have drastically helped out educationally at school not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family
that sort of crushed my reading spirit and i really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more
if these children do not listen we need to do something about it
the library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want
so please make sure you try to spend time with your family
humans have different taste in food music movies and books
the man got to see his newborn baby and his wife
my parents believe that i am at the right age that i should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music i want to
censorship is everywhere not just in libraries
thus i enjoyed the aerial view over most of the important cities
computers are good were ever you go it can look up for a project for school
people these days use computers for pleasure
a showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat its faster and the two people can see each other
it was completely dark
i was able to let them know a matter of seconds
movies can reveal whatever they want
as long as he is there the whole routine of the house is upset
finally a computer is help when it comes to school or work
the road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through hoping to get water
you can go on game sites and play thousands of different games
radios have specific channels playing specific music
most of it is very helpful information
many products such as paper gum rubber etc are obtained from trees
so in other words i do think libraries should be able to censor books music movies and magazines
also some people have bad hand writing
you could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out
computers provide better and faster communication
a minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults or someone over the age of eighteen
and it more people are outside will notice how nature is and says that use of the electricity in a house
finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road
this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time say before the last world war
he or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book
this park is just a short distance from my house
so please put the bad books music magazines etc
one of them was pulling her eyes back like someone would do if they were imitating an person because they were itchy
as a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read
to this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate
this is why the computer supports our society
i had no way of communicating with her until i found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people
this is why i think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across
also i can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves
one thing in a book not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else
they made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated
although each side has its own reasons computers do have a positive effect on people and on society
no one can agree on what will have a negative impact on children making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best left off the shelf
negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good
now think about global warming
in the popular search engine attempted to set up shop in the country but quickly entered into dispute with the about the censoring of certain materials
computers are good and bad at the same time
movies also give people something to do when they are bored
secondly learning you can learn a lot on a computer all you have to do is look for it
also everyone today listens to music
once they lose hope they wont try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength
furthermore people spend less time interacting with family and friends
the only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived
censorship should be evident in all sections of the library
you can get them at any ticket sales website
this is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations
computers normally have effects like this on the people that use them
if you ask me i think they should leave up their
an orange tree grows big as the mango tree
the setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike
computers give you too much information than a book
the computer would alert the doctors
all of those things make work easier
they are also far more reliable
let me explain why computers can ruin lives
colour has been an inseparable part of man’s existence from times immemorial
will see the magazine as an opportunity
these websites help keep in touch to with family
the internet also keeps me closer to my brother whose in college because we can chat and send pictures to each other
i think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things
clearly computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful
computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather
each book in a library bears its own relation to each person that enters that library
yes you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person
video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game
it is very dry and hot out there but
i think that when old enough they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive
in my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done
the features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclists anger
this answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness
bulling happens everyday
kids talk to people how do they know who they really are
a third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online
to me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends
new advancements in technology in general take away from our lives negatively
one reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends
these ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away
they will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship
they are helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class
in the evening we went for a walk on the mall road
what if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read
a bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble
as said by people from the state
my first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers is the health issue
certain materials such as books movies magazines and comics can be offensive to certain people
it should be up to the parent to decide which books there child should read which magazines they should buy and which television programs they should watch
people become overweight also
but yes take with caution there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at till adults
i feel that these things should be taken out of libraries if they are offensive to some people
the main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight books and personal creativity
secondly it gives the people the ability to on other cultures or where a is
i agree that this benefits society
allow the adults to censor what should be censored in their families
computers make people develop hand eye coordination
i believe are exceptional writers and promising producers and artists
the car was badly smashed
books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person
the rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel
also i believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean nasty and offensive materials
finally it makes your life so much easier
then i will take the test again
censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history but necessary when protecting the young
computers do have effect on people
keeping books away from people is not good for them they would not be able to learn from the things they read
our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival
dear newspaper people in our community use computers for positive ideas
hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday
its not such a far fetched idea
it would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it
people have different criteria when it comes to deciding a level of offensiveness
i believe that books music movies magazines or anything else should not be removed if they are found offensive to anybody
he is so relieved he cant believe his luck
i do not like showy and multicolored clothes
for a cyclist every thing becomes more serious
libraries should not have the right to censor material
children are going on the instead of doing there homework
he will play on these websites for hours
i strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society
third his water bottle is emptying at an alarming late due to his third and relentless heat
we can make and distribute item much faster
censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the of
these are the main reasons why computers are not beneficial to the society
some beggars begin the name of god
there are a kitchen a bathroom and a storehouse in our house
in fact if we could scan people to find addiction of the population would be addicted to computers
some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact
he eats grass and fodder
just like how has a new song out
second the library should be about education fun and interesting contents not by offending someones religion
my sister lives in and as a result i barely get to see her or even talk to her
you can watch all types of movies
in this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is
the place was real to
together we can make a change or find a cure
one time i wanted to go on the web and look to see there was a in
was having so much fun that he lost track of time
if books and or materials are removed from the shelves that can hide so much useful information that people could gain
first all think about the schools that the runs
yes people shall spend time outside or with family in small does the computer good for you
the can talk to other the world
there is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help water food or shelter
when she feels that an important part of her life is returning that she can become comfortable and focused
the computer you can look for information make faster
he creates a setting that many people can relate to because of the general feel of family and heritage
with this variety it has to please at least one person
my name is and i think computers are not bad
it is on the ground floor of the school building
eventually if continues to drop at this the will have a world that went
it is evident by the tone used by the author that these were happy times
computer are good to have around the house but
the more books that are removed from the library the less people will know about the subject
the kids what it but there is one book
instead of picking up a book you can go online
furthermore hes in the middle of nowhere
because of this they cant bond and they wont have a real friendship
kids should be persuaded to play outside and be in sports and have fun with the family or ride there bike
no two men can be the same
as mentioned before the social life you had will be gone
everything in the world is in one computer
everyone should have some relationship
remember the words of shakespeare
it is just something in our world that we have to live with
i think i need a stronger my eye are getting worse
all of these things support that the internet makes learning about foreign places easy
although computers are hurting them by the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes
how could a student be so certain their grammar is perfect on their homework without asking a teacher
what can get better than that we can research a famous person google dead people look up pictures
if any book music movies magazines etc
in the memoir he grew up in a kitchen full of people who taught him to love cooking
they can cycle for along time however weather can affect the cyclist
dear i believe it is true many people use computers and that many more will use them in the future
there is no point in hiding the truth from anyone because no matter what they will find out eventually
this test meant more to then she just failing
and who knows they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak
they are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others
but every so often you have someone that abuses their rights to something
for example i remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me
also i believe that it is the parents job to regulate what their children read
just like that computers help to get questions answered fast
there are a bunch of games to play or videos to watch
each feature causing the cyclist to act
most libraries are organized into sections for children young adults and adults
the says things about the older gentle man throughout the story
i had to go to the to get it
i hope by now you feel the same
another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness
i do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading
we show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic
furthermore it is obvious when people are on the computer they usually block out what their friends family are saying to them
you can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping
so the books and magazines should stay on the shelf
you can get in contact with people if you have a question you can look it up and you can do your job on a computer
being a high school student and having a nice library in my school i have learned a lot from the books in my library
have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate
additionally he biked across a water pump that was well needed he tried to pump water but got no success
these are my reasons i think computers are important and positive to people
this problem needs to stop and be addressed by the police
recently my grandmother moved down to and i can only talk to her on the phone
books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions
should not be censored
authors and directors spend months even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished
the author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over
items are only offensive to certain people
a library should be a place of balance
in the book censorship is the main idea in this book
i hate selfishness also
using typing would save you this time and allow you to continue on with other important tasks that are needed to be completed
it tasted like battery acid
sometimes in order to understand a major world event such as the death of have to understand the violence and forces that were used
they are categorized just as much as books and music
as you can see this is a ability and can be a big help when you need to know something fast
most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work
in the end computers are great if used in regulation
with a computer in all that time you could be completely finished with you whole project
if you are bored games are very fun
authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored
yes the electric bill could be higher but for a good cause
bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves
instead seeing the through their own eyes they are seeing it on videos or in on the internet
i just think it personal wrong to say those kind of things in movies
we would learn this and would be able to teach others
if something was removed from the shelf at a library because someone found it offensive i would be disturbed
keep reading for more information
or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more computer should not be in their way
going on the computer takes away from this time
lincoln is regarded as the greatest american president
these thoughts opinions and facts be offensive to a select few in our
she is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture
i believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day
also the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive
websites that are colorful and fun can teach kids how to multiply and read
these sites are not boring
they had left their whole family behind
a lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea
probably not will that computer game running
so i think that it is a wast of paper
her family had a good relationship with family and friends
first the climate was a recipe for a disaster
should certain materials be removed from your public library
how can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries
any book could be offensive to any one person
what would this world be with no computers
she told a bunch of friends and me about it
it is important to be aware of what is going on around you
nature is so beautiful why ever it
dear local newspaper i think the effects that computers have on people are bad and should be stopped
so next time anything else just think the other options
computer are a great resource in our everyday lives so why not use what we were given
if we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books
they are on the computers when they should be exercising
i wonder why people disagree and i hope that after reading this you will too
instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising enjoying and being with family and friends
now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to
if people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books
this is supposed to be a democracy not a dictatorship
in history because he killed people
the people who are of proper age will be able to get the material however
and that you have homework
there has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently
next time you see a person who thinks computers give negative effects to people tell the advantages of the computers and how it benefits society around you
they are teaching us something
computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily
they have the same affect
the movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom
soon the platform wears a deserted look
should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
this crusade of theirs posed the questions can and should be censored
freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups
it helps learn communicate and most of all do the important things that we need
not only do you type on it you learn on it
it shows a sense of determination
in this instance a moderation would be helpful
but what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes
my heart is filled with joy when i play or watch a hockey match
he should devote time to every subject
so in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects
rather than lead them into making bad decisions
why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your
however when you look at the facts a computer can teach a lot
first of all how do we define offensive
there are many things a person can do on a computer
many of these companies let us take these devices to allow as to do everyday things
last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out
india got freedom under his leadership
lastly computers let us talk to other people online
there are many movies songs and books in the world that are good
not only can you talk with family you can talk to friends
finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up
baby sitters need to do their homework
they hit the ball hard from their side to the side of the rivals
no one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again
it means giving up the right to say and think however you want
the mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways
some of the material in the section is not always bad sometimes it contains material over war and recessions
so go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive
we could try getting rid of all bad books movies etc but over time i sure more will be made
this days little kids now everything and it is because of what they watch and see
so when the country that she is has spring again she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring
then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding
the cyclist in do not exceed posted speed limit was affected greatly by the features of the setting
the settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways
i do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how other think of them
the computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites
dear of technology seems to have a positive effect on people
computers create a relaxing entertainment opportunity
prostitution happens because of online chats
did you know that of adults are overweight
when summertime comes around and the last school bell rings you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments
though he was in a ghost town
many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow
they often state that it is their favorite book of all time
about of people chat online with families or friends
i think that have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly and i think we should
why not talk to real people
it would impair our basic rights
there will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored
if people want this is going to be a big war
dear local newspaper i think that computers are great for our society
what is your vision on computers today
the owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library not the customers
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
she was carrying a big bouquet of flowers in her hands
they help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game
if people gain the right to take books off shelves then music movies magazines will all get taken off shelves too
these are the authors mood in the memoir
for an example music music is a great cause of things that people motivate to do things and get really into the songs
us children are always curious to know things especially when we are growing up
i think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores to where like adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want
they are on to check
many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure but where do the peers get the idea that is acceptable
also looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending to fix the problems
the cool relaxing air at the beach is much nicer than a dark stuffy room with just the glow of a computer
some argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf but i beg to differ
secondly it allows people to talk online with friends
your almost taking the words out of context when you do this
he stop going school he gaining
as soon as he was about to give up his troubles thirst and fear were all behind him now
this describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up
computers a topic if you ask me
do you think we should have censorship in our libraries
offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person not be offensive to another person
nothing can make you feel bored while you have an interesting hobby to turn to
so thank you for listening
the book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity
for example once my friend was planning on going to for a business trip but had no idea how to speak the language
certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not
this should be censored in libraries
some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family
for those parents or people who disagree with what is shown on the shelf
i think that the books movies magazines etc
both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief
that would be a terrible thing
i think it is an excellent thing to have
he is very cooperative by nature
then our teacher read out lovely stories
thank your for reading this letter and i hope you can take this into consideration
if they took books like that away what would the people that like them do
what will we know about the past
the environment is a hostile one for a cyclist
you can call up your friends and play with them
in conclusion the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland
that is why the author concludes that statement
dear computers are beginning to be a problem in many households
for example some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person
then if i like it i start singing it
this year my brother and my closest cousin to me went to college
then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice
finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them
one reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways
many people had or at home as they them
the features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers of doing it
society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not
what do we find offensive
well i think the opposite of that opinion
dear readers i right to you today about the effects of computer usage
with good time management i actually find these websites important
go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen
this means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water
i believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society
she will take the test again and will not give up
three main reason as to why i think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are is a very big issue
the author is grateful that his parents left their homes and left everything behind to give a better life to their kids
secondly people would be able to learn about faraway places
the author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves

censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents backs
from what a word means to the directions to get to the computer can help with all of this
it makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it or that past generations have something to hide
censorship holds back many artists true potential
also teachers can put their grade books in their had drive
there were not many structures on the way
therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out
should we remove these inappropriate items
when was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport
no one would know what an author would be leading too not a single artist could display their art
have you ever thought about how much easier it is college course online
music is the same way

and could have even died
censorship the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye
the writer makes me feel joyful because it reminds me of what my family is like
it is tone of love because he explains that his parents taught him many great things
so when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them
if students can have access to then whats the option for them
flying high i can enjoy the fresh breeze and watch the beautiful sunset from the top
not the way everyone else wants them to
if i had a problem with the restriction levels at the library i just would stop going
i think you would find more things about that person that you would in books
the possess of issuing the tickets restarted
most are probably so much time on the computer that there not getting enough physical activities

the mood the author creates in this memoir is gratitude
the mood of love and care is incorporated into the memories of her childhood beginning from the time she was born
the technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life easier
if it were more strict it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts
most kids in the are a member of a social network like or

lastly computers have cause another problem called bullying
this is how the mood was happy and made me thankful

because many people even young children can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn
kids spend too much time on computers
how many of you have ever heard any offensive language
we would have less conflict less deaths and better lives that are enriched not corrupted with quality media
my final point that is to be made is all the costs that come with computers
the text says no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
so what do you think about them now
computers keep lots of kids of the streets instead of being out and causing trouble
you might create a book a song or a movie that will offend someone in a way
the house was decorated with streamers and balloons
when the crops grow he harvests the crop and sells them in the market
this is why when these movies are played on television they are edited so all audiences can watch
a complete citizens and drives them from family and friends
censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries
sometimes we just want a good book to read
are so many things out in the society today that can offend people and what might majorly offend one might have no effect on the other
many people around the world use solar panels to gain their energy from the sun to power their lights computers etc

teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing
lastly using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email other social networks
no reading material should be taken off the shelf

there is one thing about the computer that is amazing
the line is that computers are very helpful
my personal opinion is that they should not be removed
how could you just take that away
the text says somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees
so should offensive materials be removed from the shelves
sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable other times it can be rather disturbing
there is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library
the material can also be inappropriate for younger children
if the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing

for example when the author says their were no cars nor buildings in sight that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere
by computers letting people easily access tools that help us gain knowledge can become more advanced in many of our lives

i think this because there can be somethings that you not want your children to read
the mood in the story is very happy
like i said in my first paragraph everywhere you go you see somebody wired into an electronic device
in the final paragraph she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home
therefore they very beneficial to the world its people and technology
or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word
while you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
dear computers are a big part of our society
our country was built on free speech and now it is being taken away
and how all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in united

instead of using a book which wastes trees to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job
also there is no one around to help him if he gets lost
also could not think for themselves because the censored everything you could think of
this is also an example of fear that started over coming him when he saw even more changes
on the other side though a lot of people use a computer for work and school
the music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular
this is also helpful because if you are working on a project and your mom cant you to get books at library then there you go
had to be intimidating
computers are being used for more then just work
that is how the mood is set
the best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else

even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person

after school hours i came home with sorrow and anger
another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now
i think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home

if books were to be taken of the shelves we would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world
to help us catch criminals
take movies as another example
i have been to the library many times none of which have i ever seen anything offensive

same for when some one asks you whats offensive to you
let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs

the library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh
media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do

so i think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again

a library is a place that brings all sorts of people together
computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion

why pay too much money for spending much time in the computer when you can turn off the computer and spend some time with your friends

that was a very dark period in history
when they go to work not everything will be done on a computer but this is all they are being taught to use

people should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them
there are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive
however that is the way people in that time spoke
last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines
its all about your style and what you let your child see
the author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up
i feel like authors artists musicians and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want

however we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror
in fact showed of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need
my final reason why the use of computers is good because people can interact with their family and friends online
as a result the setting was related to the authors moods
my first reason is that they relieve stress
in the essay it says the sun was beginning to heat beat down but i barely noticed it
in the end i think that computers are a real waste of time

the mood created by the author in this memoir is a very calm mood
the hills would make the trip more difficult

out people who store their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do
plus on video sites there are comedy
a morning walk is a very good exercise
these marvelous machines can provide entertainment socialize with people around the world and even provide information on any topic you would like
computers allow you to look up those places
i should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf
in my opinion computers have a positive affect on people
a misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess
many people in different cultures find many different things offensive
i go for a morning walk regularly
if that is taken away they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things
some content could be offensive to not just children but also to teenagers and adults
you can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do
i can relate it to a time i was played soccer games during the summer heat
on the hand i believe the computers put positive effects on people

in conclusion in our culture because are very crucial in our culture because it can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live faraway
libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf
as people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong

some old buildings collapsed
the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story adjusting to changed in life
the mood created by the in this memoir is mostly grateful through the memoir
but do they really consider both sides

for example you can talk to your friends and family to check in on them and see how their doing
many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their tasks
music can talk you in to killing yourself drive you crazy hurt your soul when hear what someone else has been throw

people who spent hours on the computer live a sedentary life style
first computer let learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms
could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children but are instead holding back our society as a whole
relationships with others online is never real
should one take offense to a certain book they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it
they should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things
for one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything
such as friends family and nature
to solve the problem everything should not be censored
so in my opinion life without computers would be good for everyone
there are some people that would have to look at that for research or something else
the information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant
the cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town
but i think on people with computer such as talking to people who you cant see looking up information gives people something to do
all this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad

this is why computers are good
people should be able to watch what movies they want

people use the computer for many things books movies and so one
the heat lack of water and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was going to die and the birds would pick him clean
panic cant help to solve anything
here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike the baron landscape and relentless sun
i could understand the whole cellphone thing but you need to make more time for your family
in the backyard there is a small vegetable garden
another reason why a computer is not needed is many people neglect pure nature
lastly you can talk and video chat
you ask yourself why
its easy to find entertainment and is extremely helpful and profitable
i mean seriously if you play computer games you can have fun while knowing your going to make your doctor happy
having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself
this is a very simple an straight forward concept
they have the authority and right to do so
first of all being on the computer too much is not healthy
now i know some people not have grown up hearing foul words but many of us have
any item whether biased or not should be able to be found on the shelves of a library
it has hundreds of books
out people are obese
second the computer causes you to interact with people less
this one is a sort of spear against the devil of carelessness
computer can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you
for example there are many different religions in the world
they made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things
additionally the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful which gives the reader a positive feeling
that they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through
i believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons
most of your day should not be on the computer
the story says i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink
dear i am on the side of computers
because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life
they showed me with their lives and these teachings have been the basic of my life
if it is possible to have two moods then this memoir does
could you imagine life without computers
well thank you for reading my opinions about computers
i think that computers are perfect and can help you build skills
so please help yourselves and the earth stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive
another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area
even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay
the real question is though is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people
the economy is bad enough the way it is
also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that
books and magazines are two fun things people love to read
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and kind for many reasons
not only can computers tell people about interesting places but interesting people
i choose to visit the library in search for books i could use to gather more information
therefore you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country
another theme is to overcome your obstacles
obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to disease
perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time
children wont learn at a young age how to think on there fact language
which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one
it might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines
being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer
over here he is saying that your friends can be your family or the people that you love
there are ways people can avoid seeing them
traveling on footboards is very common
still many authors write about political matters and some books can educate the reader about points that they have not yet seen before
these are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him
so much information and so much faster
i remember when i younger me and my friends always wanted to go see rated movies
lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world
for some reason everyone wants to demoralize people and that is where i think it the
this is the best and most efficient way to protect and keep everyone safe
all these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people
this shows that he is grateful of his culture
in my personal opinion libraries would be better if books magazines movies etc
and because he was in the desert there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type
dear i understand that there has been somethings going on with computers
dear newspaper readers many hours a day do you spend on the computer
the mood is created by his parents and where he lives
the features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip
the author also writes
they are the best technology because you can do anything on the computer
also kids or adults will be unhealthy and not exercise
censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights
due to his lack of water he became dehydrated and really weak
not all use an email some use instant messaging
to remove such things from the library would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body or hearing a curse word
on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures
if there is a need for things like this then have a special store for things like this
if your eyesight is already damaged a computer will worsen it
these are all great ways to use computers
the library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic
when my mom lost contact with one of new friends regretted not spending so much time with them
computers we use them everyday
i have a bath and dress up for school
the mood in this memoir i believe is appreciation and caring towards others
so should context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it
they can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer
in conclusion i believe computers are good because one many kids need them for school second they have a lot of educational games
the tree was laden with fruit
she then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood
he recalled i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
when up got picture typed up paper saved our was empty
while we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise
it has forty classrooms
we learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of facts
these dangers effect every user and their families
one way is that the rolling hills let the rider get more tired
for example these passages are set to copy down your number get your account number then take your money
libraries have all kinds of amazing different books
when we got to the library things got worse
if you take these things away certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things could possibly read
as i got ready while my position paper this year
books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people
in conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
in conclusion computers have a positive effect on people
the normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated
the features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist
finally from what you experienced
presentations essays graphs anything
this also allows a variety of books to a variety of people
libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials
reading it is a joy to some and a pain to others
we have learned many great things from the internet
they blame them for thing the forget to
their are books everywhere right
as much as i would like to just to prevent others from reading it i cannot
taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them but this will decline the library usage and people will slowly stop reading
however someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown will remove the material
they should be things wait to see it
at the end of class gets graded and the grade on turns out to be a
this is a fantastic effect that computers have on people
there every thing is so stereotyped
some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences
the mood created by the author was very happy
kid or if your an adult
they have to exist with the affected the cyclist
but first was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool
it brought peoples attention to recent happenings
he is looked after by his parents
you would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life
the children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular
once a person is online there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted
this is bad for your eye sight
in my opinion i say no to this question
while she was planting it she seen geese and she was reminded of home
the cyclist found a deserted building he lost more and more hope
books mean a lot to people that love to read
my hobby is gardening
people will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is so why is censorship such a big deal
the rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
i would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after
at the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map
the computer has changed society a lot for the better
without it how were you going to get your info
we are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say
we make our students come involved in technology
a little while back i was in the library and i noticed a book that was offending
the holocaust was an event that became known wide during which was a major historical event
but if you going to go on to just go on to just talk to friend then that is a waste of time in somebody life
parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read
my has a computer class where we learn how to skillfully type
they are not spending time with the family instead they would like to spend their free time on the
you can even get a college degree online if you wished
are maybe really good books
we should be kind to each other and speak politely
if the library does not have the kind of books you do not want your child to see then your child can not look at that book
talking to family members can do good for you in many ways
but whats you opinion
dear local people have been using computers for years
first people spend less time exercising
how can one person or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not
it started entering the low lying shops
her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring
everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny
while being helped in return
i think this is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was
a world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today
i believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that should be removed from the shelf
i will now get into more detail on these three topics
now who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking doing drugs and other various risky activities are okay
also we could look at places we never saw before and if you want to get some where you can go the computer to do that
i believe there is no harm in libraries it is a place where you go to get all the information you can
with a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep
i believe we should still use computers
this creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future
activities keep you mind off things read on to find our more
with a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets
but why should we remove books magazines movies etc from shelves
i personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch read and listen to
for example they write going dance
just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school believe it or not
if someone was at a library and thought the series were offensive they might be the only ones to think that
spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising
more then not kids and parents abuse the computer
so he gets on a bike and rides to the next town
these are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places
how does the computer effect people
i want my library to be what was made to be a mixture of cultures and backgrounds
especially when you get older and have children
there are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away
lastly your teenager probably do their homework
there is really no reason for them to looking at it at all
computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature
now those same kids are smoking pot having sex getting girls pregnant abortions miscarriages things that are not appropriate
as for food you sit and eat junk food
there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my baby sister
rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit at this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere
so i am here with my parents because of a computer
if they see someone doing drugs or having sex they might think that it is cool
for me to have fun on
would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read watching movies or shows or listening to music
this time could have been used for more productive things instead
the subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times
i have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf
these are my reasons and i hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today
no one would be able to read and no one would be able to express themselves freely
computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school
now stating those two things has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful
she really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring she will have new energy to take the test again
also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes
in our spare time we all enjoy to read and the things that let us do so
during my freshman year we read a book called and before we read it our teacher told us a little bit about what it is about
but out of my likes i have five on the top
he was all ways thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is no paint in
but to much is not good
they provide education for anyone who has access to the internet
you could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do
also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her
finally computers are great to communicate with people far away
i knew i could trust him with all of my secrets
our culture is now bigger better faster and stronger thanks to the help of technology today
seeing those things i felt as if i had landed in a different world altogether
when the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding
there are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience
if librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults a lot of books will be gone from the shelves
do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive
computers help children and adults learn so much
you know people that like to travel to far away places and have fun would rather that than waste their time on a computer
on to next subject the expert say were not enjoying out doors but the over looked something here it is
we overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination
he also said that in his neighborhood cultures came together and there was unity and friendship
post is a very slow and costly service while the internet is cheaper and quicker
if they need it out of site you can always put it on the highest shelf
gives the parent control of what their child sees instead of the child having full control
his ideas are very different than most
the author is also trying to create a loving mood in the sense that he is explaining the caring acts of his parents
all of these details contribute to the overall mood of the memoir
in the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick
that she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort
the rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body but also his mind
history has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful
overall computers are useful
if we decide to take one book off of the shelf then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty
all the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble
with such experience computers take away time with and when i had computer always now we never spent time with her
my mother father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge of the language or the culture
that was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir
computers do benefit society
books that some find offensive have already been printed and sold to others
i believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to
yes some of these way can be dangerous but are safe
she took it with her everywhere she went
one of my favorite sports is softball
there is a direct connection between the lack communication at home for teens computer usage
by next spring shell be able to drive
in my house all people in my family has a computer but of the computers are used once a week
the articles would probably be after the events occur
have you ever been lost
there for the wood of the memoir is those two reasons why it is a mood that the author created
another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit
it is their right as an to buy what they want
all my friends were also invitedi was very happy to see them
the scenery was very beautiful
we learn from seeing what you guys do
well we can change that
in this case computers are good
the author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die
first he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans
you can lose your wife cause the computer because you forgot her birthday her and her because you are on the stupid computer
you can go on the internet play games and even talk with people
example even grandma have and she talks online with her family members
people not want there kids to look at certain things but they need to keep them were there kids cant find them
the only way my family can keep in touch with them not spending money is email
school libraries are a whole different idea
she applied for the clubs and groups and she started getting behind in school
with my webcam i am able to keep in touch with my cousins in
an example of this would be there was no one in sightnot a building car or structure of any kind
while people enjoy computer nature
when they pay the same taxes everyone does to have those books and movies on the libraries shelves
the second thing on the computer is research
when asked how he did he said he had been playing computer games since he was years old
the setting of this place effects the cyclist very much
like on the quote of the rusted water pump
i believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries
do you remember the last time you locked something up on the computer
therefore they inspire us
the things they do to make some cash around here do you agree with me
when i was in fifth grade chaos broke out in my community
but you can also talk to your friends too
when we would arrive home are parents would ask what we saw we would lie and say we saw the new movie
i know someone who has a and after school all they do is talk to people
the point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything
that was difficult for them but appreciated that
over of the sites used by teens are based on networking
everyone should have a computer because you can chat with people
if you are a social butterfly and love to converse with other people then you simply must own a computer
there is an adult section for adults not children people need to realize that
books music and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe because they are found offensive
doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures
we saw that a man was getting drowned in the lake
dear people are using too much their time on the computer
we can enjoy food work hard to have sound sleep and can find happiness in our life
final grade i did not type it on a computer
but sometimes computer are bad because when people go on web sites to chat peoples can be grown ups but talking to little kids
then the student will be able to successfully complete the project
the efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks
they let him listen to his own music and watch he wanted
for example the textbooks that we use in social studies at our school still refers to as the
last he thought he saw some mirages that tells me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists
some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity
the only books that would be left would be the and children books
finally computer is a great way to keep busy because you take the time looking up information for school projects
one way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water
lastly many people do research on the internet
i can connect to this because i had a relative who admitted that he gained at least five pounds
not all of the world will care to see
to remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts
that book has gotten sold faster than the movies
computers have a very positive effect on people
this quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong
therefor if items were being removed from a public place that gives that would not let this happen
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways
i feel that it would be unfair to remove books that some audiences would enjoy
books help people in many ways
they both are search engines
stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured
dear computers tend to have more negative effects on people rather than positive
i love to play with my dolls listen to music and read fairy tales
to whom it concern i am writing this to let you know how i feel about the effects computers have on people
losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource
the mood created by the author was a very unique one
the mood of this memoir explains how precious is a home and the memories contained in it
what do you think is in store for the next years to come
it would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it
authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process
one reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans is that we have developed many ways to communicate with people all over the world
when your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery wild animals and exotic plants and flowers that live among us
the mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture
rash driving causes accidents
i have to look at it
computers are great for keeping in touch with family and friends at a distance
the tells the public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio
the only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines
they had hope in their children when they came to to have great and prosperous lives
she teaches me how to plant and take care of them
taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution
it was the first time that i had gone to such a place
putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content
the computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of
finally there is an amendment in the of for preventing censorship
my mother believed that i should not read those novels at that age
or what if they read a book and it talks about bad stuff
therefore i believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good
the setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally
everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it
the fresh air in the park refreshes my mind and body
i am a fanatic of it
it would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world
we should not get rid of the obscenity at all
all of these thing are the definition of family
these things are weighed down by the negative effects like the online dangers increasing to reality and the obesity problems we face
this is awesome because you can text video chat email free
once i actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this i thought that it was a good idea
this quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him
fine out where the wall of is
so i urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology
situations happen like this all of the time
as you can see time is a valuable thing which computers can help save
this is also good for jobs
i think censorship in libraries is wrong
there are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some interact with people learn about other places and learn about family
that is the question
glance out the window and go back to texting on that laptop
in my point of view strongly believe that it could have been form working at the some sandy desert for seeds a long period of time
it saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them
if you were going on a vacation to somewhere in you could learn about what those people do
for example fly a plane
the dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt
more people should be out exercising
it is a crowded part of the city
the computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher
on the phone she was frantic because she was giving a speech and she did not know what the statistic was for type diabetes
this benefits people in a positive way
the library could put those certain books in own part of the library
computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school
it allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college
they give people the ability to learn about anything they want on the internet
although it not be the writers at fault here
would you want your kid to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw
so he is on his way to the nearest town which is miles away and he thinks he can make it
i would choose the one for computers
i understand why he used the word it was a common word in his time
dear i am writing you this letter to inform you that computers do benefit society
gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger
and you are not aloud to unless given permission to from the creator
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change
no good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries
well i have some people spend to much time on their computer completely choice
technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park
so people should do some of the other things i said instead of just going on the computer all of the time
i say make life better and get rid of computers
which is very painful
they might not want to be around you as much
in my opinion the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society
we use computers in life
this is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people
finally is the structure first there was the ghost town with the battery acid tasting water
i think that we should not even censor the content because i feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place
in conclusion there are many people that or not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion
she believes that she can pass the test when everything is back to normal in the spring
let the pretty picture is about to change
i have to study hard to become a doctor
i came on family and many families are very close so its natural to be doing things with father or brother or whole or cousin
do we take the teacher out of the classroom
today there are many books that teach or give a bad message
it has become a separate field of study with so many specialisation techniques
the setting has a major role for a cyclist
first off many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not
my mom would probably be a little upset
all of that is done on a computer
so it just depends on the situation
lets keep are children and young adults away from violence
yes i do think computers are awesome idea
you can just go to the beach or go to the gym you have lots of stuff to do other then going online and sitting for hours
how would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas
an you cant just take that off the shelf
as he approaches towns his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief
also you can find free work out videos
this is how the features affect the cyclist
just stop and think do you want your child looking at that when you are not around
you can even simply use it to help with homework essays
in these we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous
there are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life
dear local newspaper those who do support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
websites that are selling stolen merchandise
sometimes computers take a lot of stress of you
racism happens in books all the time
and those are some of my reason why the author added mood to this memoir
i think that censorship is a terrible idea
here are my detailed reasons
but not only do people become overweight they will end up more and more distant from family and friends
a library has books on nearly all subjects
only wellmannered people can become good citizens in the country
the censorship should be used only to help the kids
now do you want that to happen to the world
dear minute of the day millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops but is it always a good thing
finally people have less time to interact with family and friends
in conclusion i think computers have a good effect on people
if someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored the author of the book would be even more offended
it has a big effect on a humans life
some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven but a lot of other people do believe in it
to achieve all these essentials a basic economic independence of all citizen is a must for democracy
if the books are offensive i believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see
magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that i take my child to
there was a pond on both sides of the road
you can with your friends email your peers and now there are website you can go on where you can talk to your friends or a stranger
this sets similarities from their old home to their new home
the shelves would be blank
people get addicted to them everyday
opinions can cause a lot of problems
everyone has there own taste
i think that people should see everything the way it is
third of all communication makes the world go around that why more and more people meet new friends
its as simple as that
this quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life
i believe that since that is true for movies it should also be true for books magazines and music
and you could also do like to the and you see people
remember it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so
it showed how she will start new and continue happily
son of a poor farmer
in the end a library should not be given the right to censor anything
censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not
censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose
this can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer
do you ever want to take that book off the shelf
well i think they should not be sitting on their damage their eyes
if people want to spend countless hours sitting in front of the glowing technology then be it
there are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people
they were loving to all and they sacrificed a lot to get to where they were
i have had a select few instances throughout my life where i have read a book or magazine that to some seem offensive and to others not at all
it saves time and is way neater
look for more and just let it let
when i asked what movie she was looking at she turned the cover over with no reservation and said
people can meet new people learn about new places and talk to friends
then i would read a few pages and i would think it was pretty good
she is ready for spring to be here so that she can study and pass the test and work at the flower
last i think another theme of this excerpt was heart felt
to add insult to injury they often befooled me and made me a target of their jokes
we asked our neighbors to stay with us for the night
some people think that people use computers too much
the author enjoyed a nice childhood filled with friends and family all enjoying the wonders of their home
are you a parent that wants to know how their child is doing in school
the materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them
computers can help with a social studies or a science project
for example last i went to tennis with mom and shes never on the computer
one of his moods is that he is happy
that just how people are and were
that is what i think the mood of this memoir is
the friend who recommended the movie or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out
dear local newspaper this is a letter about how i feel about the effects of computers
the author created the mood of happiness love achievement and being proud
there would be no rented movie stores theaters or success in the movie production industry
a bus stop hums with life and activity
in conclusion computers have a positive effect on people
you will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older

he was a very learned man but he was very humble

as you see many people that have computers use it in a productive way
libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults
we have the right to take down the books but why should we
second people are not enjoying the outdoor
however work is a really large effect computers have on people
in conclusion i think that computers are a waste of time

now computers are very popular
it is only natural to disagree with someone
so things that might help one person offend other
my final reason why computers have good effect
take the book from them

the parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming
a computer is the world at your finger tips
go to a social website and strike up a conversation
a few even stared at me insolently
if we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world
another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes
not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well
the author also said that there was no way to express her gratitude for the generosity impressed upon her at such an early age
which i can understand why someone would want to escape

all you need is a computer
the world of books can be an escape from the world they live in
many different people have different views of different kinds of books
children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out
my final reason why computers are good is that they serve instant pleasure
they resemble the earth and are aptly called terrestrial planets
but after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her
people get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars
no matter how offensive they might be there are many other ways to solve this problem
can be offensive to others
watching your teacher teach to you through a webcam
revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed
we all have our own preferences how would you like it if yours got taken away
to some having this much freedom causes great things to happen
like talk to friends look up info and teach skills

no because all people like to read different books
one topic that seems to get everyone going is censorship
this is why i think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them
in some of the reading material one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it
they should put some magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read
this could save someone time and effort
is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver

imagine how computers have helped shape the do you want to give this blessing up

examinations are not a true test of a student’s ability

about billion researchers say
most of the time the internet is very helpful
a parent not want their child to read hear or see something simply because it offends them
because everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not
this a very good thing but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them
the person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them
the truth is that there is a line that should not be crossed and some books cross this line and are banned
the reason is that benefits society
there are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting
both bright and weak students fear examinations
this is certainly a great form of technology people should have

therefore people should turn off their computers go exercise be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family
the main character was huckleberry finn who was a poor english boy whose father was a third class drunkard
when you go to the library you usually expect a huge selections of books and other materials to choose from
however i feel that more often they negatively impact the general public
an ideal student should have many qualities
censorship is based off of offensiveness
whether its playing games checking or even working peoples valuable time is getting used up
i know you agree with me
so are you going to let technology pass you by
whether or not you playing games or typing articles your eyes strain to keep up with a small font on a website
i simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain
so can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material
like most has quests with varying difficulties
if the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution
sitting on the computer for hours everyday is also looking exercise
educational tours arranged by schools promote interstate and international goodwill
if they do not like it they do not have to read it or listen to it
also i feel the libraries should rid of books that in olden times would have been a shame to read
the are websites for kids like games there are teen games there are adult games
it is your choice to avoid the books that upset you not what other people think about them
some of those books could have been the only copies yet the let their hate overcome them and destroyed the pieces of literature
and there are three of them theft cyberbully addition

disagreements could turn into debates and those could turn into fights

lastly you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot
you wont be able to see how big your family is
the way i look at it as i see is that to much is bad so i think spending some time on it is good do you agree
the is affected in many ways
this is how the computer can come in handy when you need
dear newspaper have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society
whether everyone agrees with that is a different story

in libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books magazines or movies that children should be able to read
these love and happiness were the the moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family
would you rather your kids to learn things from the facts or learn from friends
if you think it might be offensive to you then set it back on the shelf
wasting minutes is wasting money
dear local newspaper in the society we live in more and more people are using computer including me

furthermore computers are on advancement in technology that this uses constantly
however they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising
interacting with people is very nice and touching
literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture
this is how a library serves a community
in conclusion computers do help us from everyday use

this is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic
books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity
if parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children they should read the fine print
now that information is only a few clicks away

he ended up being an online predator
another example is if you had to find some information on you new dog
finally the last way a library could help is by making sure the child is old enough to check out a book or a movie
secondly can be made
of people use computers to do their informational work about faraway places
my advise to libraries keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area away from younger people who react strongly
example on you find what ever street you want
as he is riding he comes across some hills
all books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them
someone in this world is living this life it could be you
people should be able to read whatever they want offensive or not
saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money

i see many worse things on the than i read in books
so as you can see computers have good effect on our society
he studies in grade eight
another reason is going to the library cause you send more money to fill up your gas tanks

computers allow new means of communication
the last way the computer helps out the its with box from there
there is two things that are going to happen

the author concludes the story in a what seems like incomplete paragraph
it would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house
then last he is near no towns so he cant get anymore water so the setting does effect the cyclist
dear i think that computers have a positive effect on people
schools teach children about almost anything does that mean schools should be shut down
rose hibiscus lily orchids sunflower dahlia etc
too many people spend countless hours on their computers rather than doing other activities
so for just reasons i would already rethink
on the other hand many games are only for one player
we need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn
censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else
even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them
i think the books in a should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty
maybe even invite them our to talk face to face
is one of the moods because all every one in the neighbor hood got along
if people want to censor books then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population
you have to think about the younger generations
is a fanatic for science and history
the world needs its materials
that is why i think computers benefit us
lastly when viewed carefully computers are very reliable and can be made extremely safe which eliminates the main fear computers
if they do not like what they see then put it down
secondly people need to enjoy nature
it is so easy that it will seem like you are standing right next to them on a matter of seconds
most teens say they are always willing to meet new people and the internet is a great way to do so
whichever way you look at it censorship is censorship and censorship is wrong
if it is rated then i know that i see some blood gory scenes and nudity
families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen
if anything i am trying to help me and my fellow citizens
to this off it would be nice for people to take care of themselves and not stay on the internet for so long
i know this from personal experience
our teachers are also quite strict
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror
these so called computers are causing this why look over there
well if you have a computer it is a great way to research a topic for school
calling someone or sending a letter costs money but sending on email to someone does not
another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it make other reads feel like they are not alone
and throughout the memoir there is a constant mood which is happiness
they teach us things entertain us and are sometimes good pillows but they can also be bad things
over the years they would of never done that and rent movies or buy them to have on your
he creates a mood of bliss through his loving and grateful tone
they are telling you where the parents are from and when they moved here
computers allow you to connect with people who live faraway without having to travel to them

he states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him especially their generosity and sense of community
listening to music on the the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well
so what solved my problem
computers are great for work
is clear that if you want to stay healthy computer usage should be limited
the compute can touch you new thing give you the chance to chat with family and friends far away and open your mind on travel
the government of the needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional
the child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book
then we came to the cages of birds
what would you say if your library was censored
if they decide to take books off the shelves why not just have an adult section in the library
books might have something things that you find offensive but if you like the book so much you might as well finish it
we are too connected as a society
but the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society
over all i think that libraries just need to reorganize there books movies and magazines
i think it is okay for people to use computers because they get to learn new things and meet new people
that is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten
i believe peoples lives have been overcome by technology
this shows sorting like morale of never giving up
the internet is a great way to learn about different places in the world
every body in this world has their likes and dislikes
computers can also help people communicate with each other
some people like reading graphic novels or things like that
to it concern in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once
or people you can see computers let you find the information you the time has that computers without or keeping people away from family
this has happened to me before
as i stated earlier libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills
by using computer for a long period of time you begin to think how computers are all you need
one of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research
with different books comes different readers
dear newspaper people should use less time on the computer because it effects their lifestyle
it also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds
the mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation
the other girl answered
and i hope you agree with me for my three reasons you can gain weight eye problem and how are you going to pay your bill
i believe that no one should decide for us
here in it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech
you have to look at it from their view
first reason why computers are good for society is computers help people learn about things
why should information and knowledge be with held from people
most of the news can be very offensive
no one is perfect and we all make mistakes
some people just have to deal with these people
people might get offended and stop going to the library
harry even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them
when we walk into a library full of books theirs a huge variety of any kind of books
this quote shows the old beat down environment worried him
she realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment and that that is what makes a great strong individual
libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend
she became very lazy
they would be upset and disappointed about situation
giving this simple sentence a great meaning
what religion are you
i am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading
the computer is one of the greatest inventions created
if you have research to do most people use google and google is found on the computer
everyday computers are helping people get through their days with minimal problems
that is why i think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting
going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books
spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do but with computers people to not do that much anymore
this kind of stuff gets our attention and makes us interested
if you need help or answers about certain things you can always find what you are looking for in a library they have all the answers
physical fitness is a condition for mental alertness
i am torn on this topic because i am against censorship but i am also for it when laws are being broken

the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
he was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water
overall computers have a bad effect on people
many people still like the old tradition of traveling to libraries and starting the quest for the perfect book
i use such as which is an online game website or fantasy football teams i am involved in
in the story it says the sun was beginning to beat down
just be glad that you know about it now
this would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so
this undeniable thankfulness is a large part of this memoir
do you say to blame them
for example in the text it says that he staggered into the store
if they were to get one it would change so much
you know says that over of people will never go in nature they get a computer
computers have made communication easy for people
taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers
it eats small snakes lizards insects and seeds
if you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior
is very beautiful its voice is very ugly

have you ever heard of a email
obesity is a problem in
but like the internet you can block things from those kids
not to mention the career paths involving computers directly such as repairing or movie special effects
a third feature was his thirst
how do computers do that
you can ask question and get an instant reply
i think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination
the says how glade he is that his parents help him out a lot
we should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists
as technology advances humans are relying on them more and more most people use them daily
this shows he loved that his parents passed on to him a love of cooking and cooking skills
while this seemed a fair stance to take the parents then took things a step further
if some people get offended or think they get offended by something they would try to removed whatever it was from the nations stores
third it helps with school and work
why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read
secondly the towns around the way had been abandoned leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions
some like offensive things that they have in the library
the author says almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar
they have assisted education social reconnecting and the environment
i mean of course there are certain books that should be censored but in doing so you exclude great novels from the past
i can go onto webcam to see who i am talking to or i can go onto another website to get an instant message
if so then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves
the the sun was beginning to beat down
it was very beautiful and peaceful
we are very lucky to have a good neighbor
doing this could result in less material for people of all ages
the narrator is grateful for all the great times in life him and his parents had together
for instance the man drank so much water he almost ran out the water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death
the flower represents her and her driving test
dear editor i believe that computers are a great and fun tool
her name is kittyshe is big with white and brown
that is why i think the setting affected the cyclist
also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it
when in a library environment people tend to be more and more on task
last but not the least computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world
a lot of people need to take breaks off the computer because computers can do harm

it quickens reflexes during everyday life
two spend less time exercising
people need to communicate through computer a lot
to this very day people have become very addicted to computers
well knowing this truth does not stop the victims from getting attracted by this media stunt
i believe is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to
people can learn bout things places even their own family
it lots people communicate helps in educational decisions and you can learn many subjects such as math science and language
in my opinion i believe that computers have a negative effect on people
this is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it
instead of having problems lack of sun and just boring computer talk people should got up and go
finally the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles take a drink or cool off
with computers communication is becoming faster and faster
certain materials that are found in libraries are sometimes not age appropriate or even offensive to other people

while your fingers know what to do
you can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message
when you get punished it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of
i think that certain materials should not be a problem if the librarians can keep a closer eye on what their reading
do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea
some of you ask about at school
it helps us with things like learning communication and even money or economic problems
the ones that you love to watch listen to or read a million times over
letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way
there are other alternations you could make instead of using an computer
computers do not benefit society today
dear readers many people use computers but not so many people think benefits society
people naturally type about thirty words a minute
the effects of computers on me are very good
your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong
of kids spend to hours on the computer
furthermore you should have your time for on the computer and exercising
but it wont for this we will live on in the after life
so never will i think that the library should be censored

he also says how grateful he is for his parents
i think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries
the computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge and will make us more of people around the world
this is a great advancement in our society
thus like the books the magazines should also have ratings
people have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it
libraries contain many different selections of books music and magazines
adding rough pavement rusty water pumps and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well
you would get your way
i could go on and on on so many more things that computers do for us but there are not enough pages
it is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader
with each passing day computers help advance the future and help make the world a better place
they should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it
these games also make you more intelligent
many people were family to them
then she will have successfully adapted
so the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels
with all these obstacles in his way he was able to achieve his goal of getting water
remember the old black and white films
music is to be played through headphones only and must be at an appropriate volume
the mood is also grateful
not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them
i know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community
it is always enjoyable to me
computer addicts do this almost everyday and before they know it they are
when a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity
the computer can be used in many ways
if you ask me its stupid
i think it is a bad thing to have them on the shelf in a library
lastly there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family
they should only be aloud to put stuff on the shelves
in conclusion i agree that the effects computers have on people are positive
this can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity
on average out of suffer from stress
many issues cause obesity but technology computers take a big role in it
eventually all books movies magazines music and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate
i think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world
therefore i believe that there should not be censored books in a library and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed
so instead of there being a problem with one person there would a problem with two unsatisfied people
i think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves
that was a quote from paragraph
so a computer is a good invention
i believe that having a computer can be a very cool thing to have and very useful when you need it
lastly computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely
if the library took that movie off of the shelves they would lose business due to one person
therefore i do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed
computers and the were a technological break through
where he was raised and mainly the life his parents provided for him
at first when the author sees the abandoned first town he is not too worried about it and moves on
computers help people around the world to connect with other people computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world
in history we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries
one time i went into the library and i picked out a book about a haunted house
some people think they should be removed from the shelves and i am one of them
by warmth she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones
so if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone
but there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying
if the general public does not like something it will stop showing up
do i think we should have to take books off of shelves
plus you can print thing out on a computer with a book you have to copy important down
he was able to describe in great detail what went on in his house during his childhood and how caring and loving his parents were
you can learn a lot from computers
i just want to remind you that their helpful a great learning resource and a great way to stay in touch
first of all what i mean by bad things i mean your child can go on bad websites talk to strangers or get harassed
look at what our world has become
another mood is happiness
this needs to change
need to cheer up and go outside and play sports
in a recent survey it was found that people who read books online save an additional a year more than people who buy books
kids are let onto computers every day and they wonder to the websites that the internet has to offer
computers enable us to communicate with them through email or video chat without the hefty price
you can do lots of stuff with computers such as help people learn new things almost about everything
the first reason why libraries should not be censored is so they will not lose business
before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily
computers are bad for the people of the world they take our money our health and the minds of our children
computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending time together
right here he is saying that he thanks his parents for the life they had given him
you can swim jump or play sports
many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside
computers are helping schools teach students
that is what i would do
this shows that he was energized and happy
people in think the same
the computer is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends
have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived
typing fast and correctly takes practice
if you want your friends you can just message them
this can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way
children at young ages still have their innocence
censorship would lead to just like in
therefore people should not try to remove it
first i highly agree with the people who think computers are useful
when a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer
also save your to save the trip out there
some can even memorize the key board and not have to even look down
lastly this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways
i am a reader my self and i like to read in peace
books that teachers would like to give to there class to read
one example on why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called tales or the
this sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot
i think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed
some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed
when someone helps us we should always be thankful to that person
a large number of students come from villages towns and cities and they stay in a hostel
if censor material then you are going against the first amendment of
the hills caused him to use more of his energy which he needed to stay alive
this would be an exciting event for them this why they need computer
as i grew up in my younger years i hated the computer all i wanted to do was go outside and play
computers let us keep in touch with others
dear i have a very strong belief that children and adults are spending far away too much time the computer
this can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area
books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content
we should censor things but only with an extent and not go over board with it
my second reason is that the more people be on computers the more blind they could get just for being on the computers for a hour or more
social networks like allow your to keep your friends posted on what you are doing
three if your walking down the road and gotta go you can stop right in and leave
dear are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer
in conclusion those are opinions and reasons to support the effects about computers
the kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence
or you can even webcam and actually see the person face to face
assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books movies etc
as you can see computers are more useful to society then you think computers benefit society
they are either working or playing
students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries
i think that keeping offensive material in libraries have a good cause to it for one very good reason learning
yes maybe computers are away time with family but what about or in that you have at to in over a year
this gives you a chance to connect with them
the author discussed the positives in his life
lastly will stop you from spending time with friends and family
but she says its because its strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the united states
it is a place filled with knowledge and information
they are important to everyone whether they want to admit it or not
or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer
computers are very helpful devices
if somebody switched that word it could lead to it happening again
being able to reconnect with someone is very important
if you tried to take it all out like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy
therefore it makes it much easier to learn about a certain place person or thing
that are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist
there is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food
also how there was always music that was like an endless celebration
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any us
in my opinion the effects computers have on people are good
if someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law
dear newspaper i often think about the effect of technology on humans
i understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help
debates have come up on whether or not computers are benefiting or destroying society
this will effect our youth because we will be fat unhealthy and sluggish all the time
make tomorrow be a better place than today
but there is so man things that you can do online and on computers
you can also got a look into space
part of the mood was happiness
the right to choose what book they read is one that should not be taken
why should you be offended
in this time try and find a good action movie without cuss words in it
also many more jobs want people with computer skills
libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people
some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing cussing and even murder
every day constantly for about a year i came home to on the computer and began my as i
there is a simple answer to this question
i often find books movies or magazines offending another race
this makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up old beaten roads
the mood being created is happiness and sadness
after lunch i take a nap and then finish my homework
the novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations
imagination can scare people
you can search up different information over the internet
but it is the misuse of time
most websites give the ability for anyone to do so
this is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life
people always saying kids should read more
well you could go on a computer and look for food online
the have a right to learn without the influence of others but censorship denies them of that right
about three years ago i went on vacation to
talking online is just as fast as texting
some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects
none like to be a loner
it is a reflection of sunlight that falls on it
questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises
to stay on playing mindless games or randomly searching the web
people need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time
authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them
the postmen work day in and day out
computers require you to type which is a great skill
it not okay for you too say one thing and something your child found in the library say it okay
ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is
the time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind as told by the man
i have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop
in addition computers help you learn more about people places and cultures
they strengthen the relations of friendship among various states and countries
there was no one insight not a building car or any structure of any kind
for example my mom runs miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer
books such as is a book i had read and it was very out there and straight forward
when they are out with their family they think of their computer
it was where i learned the real definition of family
no water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going water
harmful things need to be removed from everything
you want people to be over weight
there are puzzle games that challenge you action that are fun and take rapid button pressing and adventure that let you explore new lands
it shows her getting used to the new home
in had a front page spread to promote the use of computers instead of books
no people in sight lacked security and water also no buildings
they get to live in a house then
in the desert the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water
this way no one will know that they read it
the geese which form a distinctive v are becoming familiar to her
instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice sunny joy go for a walk in the woods
most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents
other peoples parents feel the same way
if future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings then they will lack the insight we had gained
hes riding on hills which makes it even harder
many people have family and friends that live far away from them
a lot of might get offended by all the racial slurs about
so the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do
there is a great rush at the doors of the compartments
people spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends
they should just be put in their own area for adults to read only
the authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story
also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on
on there you can fin what ever your looking for
through the internet people can type messages back and forth
first of all computers have caused to not exercise and become unhealthy
in school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required
it is already and we are using the computer for so much
if your not going to finish it then why is it there
well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf
being on the computer constantly can ruins your life
you would use a computer to get in touch with friends
also typing on the computer teaches us hand eye coordination that can help us with other things
this is how the setting changed
have you ever found books movies music and magazines that are about drugs sexuality and violence
also you can talk to your friends or family over the internet
i think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it
most people who find things offensive in a library are always looking at the bad side of the situation
the mood the author created in this memoir was very proud
water of the ocean is salty and not suitable for drinking
i have cousins who live in
the cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers
many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples opinions
give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to
the main way of being social these days other than texting is to chat online with friends
are still some reasons why computers are not very good
he does not bring his own bedding and we have to supply it at great inconvenience to ourselves
a final mood would be happiness
they will be able to do more thing without messing up
please keep reading to hear more about why computers are good
i think that because people should be having fun socializing with people and living there life
i thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home
dear local newspaper i just heard that people are spending too much time on computers than with their families and friends
they are known to be friendly and intelligent by nature
we all know that we all gain weight at some point in our life and we can lose that weight
books offer us as humans so much from to entertainment to even a form of comfort
in my computers class
it is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf
the cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map
i know when i go i always find my style of music that appeals to me
this communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future
for you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being an for the author of that material
it all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library
adults and even some teenagers have jobs in
it is your choice in what you want to read listen to or watch
a lot of people these days are using
just like legal things only legal for adults
the author did not put any negative information in the memoir and only put a positive feeling
i choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to
she is constantly on it
he always takes part in the school athletic events
people make decisions
she had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen
that contain offensive material from the shelves
everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves
dear i strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days
for example here we learn and
the cyclist had nowhere to go to get help
with the computers in use people become less fit and healthy
for example if the library choose to take out the bible and romance novels then they would loss a lot of customers
the author thanks his parents several times
then their going to go tell there friends what they heard because they think its cool then all kinds of kids are hearing it
though this is true it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it
people who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button
censoring our libraries is like censoring us
most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise
if they start crying people who are working can be disturbed
yes that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me
throughout the computer there is many ways to communicate with others which is an amazing thing
in our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things and we are able to like what ever we want
of you eating an not exercising because your worried about the computer
however i strongly believe that this should be limited
of course you come across a book that be offensive to someone maybe even yourself but it is there for a reason
the spring is a time for archetypal rebirth
they need to get involved and stay out of these bad things seeing bad picture hearing bad words and watching horrible things in movies
she will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later
not to mention typing a paper is a lot neater
computers educate people about places all over the world
if a student to do a presentation on something they would want to know more about it and lookthe topic up
one of the moods is love
this is a positive effect for our country
it will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say so the problem should just be left alone
there are so many social things to do on the computer and those are just some
i really hope you will consider my opinion for your article editor of the
this makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be
as he began to approach the desert he noticed he was running low on water
also to stay in touch with family and friends
if everybody paid attention too offensive entertainment regardless to what kind people would be upset all the time
mr david has four childrentwo sons and two daughters
and when many whites started to find out they begin to question the young man about how he dress and why
computers are showing kids the wrong mind frame they need to be in
also i could see what the news are and i could contact teachers through the computer
he came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building
they would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever
they know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author
other people sit at their and get mad or angry at
they do not exercise as much
then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work
you ever want to communicate with your friends all day long without wasting minutes
the game starts with a bullyoff at the center between the centerforwards of the rival teams
computers have software were you can instant message send emails or even video chat with that person
when i clicked on it i was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures
to continue with computers help families by bringing them closer in a way
an ideal teacher knows the art of teaching
this is my last reason why i think computers have a positive effect on people
put others before yourself and work hard
children see it outside of school and stay away from it then so they can stay away from it in school also
when these old forsaken things one mentioned it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair
no i do not believe this statement for many reasons
he is happy is parents worked so hard to get him to new jersey
we live in a world today where education is everything and we think that everyone should have an education
the government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive
when she worked at the company they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work
and to tap that off he drinks water that tastes like battery acid
dear sir or mam have you or someone in your family ever read a book magazine or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive
will authors remove their books from libraries
i agree that computers have a bad effect on people because they will spend less time exercising
i have also grown many flowers
the setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going
in addition to computers let you book flights buy tax rates
that is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip
let me compare this to a book
which is good because its much easier
also the parents and child need to spend time together if they are both on the computer they cant spend time together
have fun where is the computer
experts say that the computer restricts time to workout but in all truth the computer is the key to the gym
please read on so i can explain my reasons
i shall never let myself fall ill again
along with the programs to write a paper you can use the internet and google to get the information
it seem as if viewing reading or listening to something violent or explicit would have an effect on the listener
also all the negative things that can happen like spending less time with family members getting addicted and being unhealthy
she failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test
someone out there hates this book and hated it from the day it was published
if i had a library i would sell just about anything i could
computers greatly help families of today
there was a great rush outside the railway station
although there are other things that can be found in the library as well
one of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through
i would get the cooperation of all my staff members
and did i say it was against the law because it is
these are merely a few ways that the internet helps with schooling
will take a few hours but you will be educated
creativity is a large part of life and without it we would all be the same
reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening
many students like fiction books which are true story but it might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student is feeling racist to him
all in all there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests
having things censored ruins a lot of things the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way
plus it would help the kid in deciding on what to read
so authors have freedom to write what they would like to
if you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them talk to them about it
a library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books
knowing that others have already successfully passed
do you think computers are a positive effect or a negative effect
first and most importantly he is affected by the people who live there
teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks
it is one of the wonders of the world
it allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than seconds
he is in a hot place similar to a desert
there have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that i was not ready to learn about
with computers you are able to plan your life with output
furthermore the author of the memoir expressed this by saying that his family turned this simple house into a home
even if they are offensive they can teach young teenagers about their past
and lastly the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them took a house and turned it into a home would be comforting
you can do something with them online
those who borrow anything at the library have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge
all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey
dear local newspaper i have heard about this issue concerning people are on their computer to much
as a teenager i am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself
it seems to me in my opinion that computers have more of a negative affect on people than positive
between and more people have been using their computers more often
the authors main point is to thank their parents for everything they have done
take away from your computer and go outside
even his meaningless chatter is a source of joy
i think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them
has it really helped us
so should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay
they were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot
or i can also talk to friends after a long day of school
this is show when he says
i fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading
she says its alright and you guys keep chatting it all worked out
what you can find online still amazes me
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
would this not get on your nerves
when the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes he is both mentally and physically exhausted
there are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive
in my conclusion censorship is not good in our public libraries because it taking basic things out of the libraries and taking half of the reading from people
that is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase
when she took that test everything was unfamiliar to her so she failed but on her way back something familiar found her
now i told you all the reasons why i think using a computer is good
all my reasons before
this causes the internet addicted person to lose relationships with their family and friends
we had dinner at the platform
there is one thing however that really sticks out in my mind
they are very helpful in many ways
at midday we have a recess
at some point tumble weeds crossed my path
never once have i ever been outside and relaxed besides when i got on and off the bus for school
many things about the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist
computers also get you hurt or if you buy on be careful
you can type up a page essay if you wish
they should be spending time with family and friends
he than talks about all of the good times that they have and than he thanks them one more time
it is our job to help people over come the side affects of computers
we can be a conqueror if we learn more and more from our teachers and books
if someone does not approve of a movie or something they can search another shelf
the mood in the memoir swifts throughout the story
school or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life
there are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books
when she accomplishes this she is growing just like the hibiscus
have you gain weight just from staying on the computer for too long
there are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world
same goes if a friend or you move away but want to stay in touch
computers are bad for most people
have some fan in the sun today
just we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our
in my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days
he is a good sportsman
therefore the market place is an important centre in the town
it always is a terror that falls violently
i thought that the internet had just my mom better than i could that we should go on vacation
chatting is the number one thing kids adults and teenagers do
the post office also distributes mail
lastly they allow people to talk online with others
the people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read
they said that they can interact with family members who live far away
when a mango fruits is ripe it gives a sweet smell and the juice
there is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives
there should be equal rights all over yes even in libraries
problems can be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner
and if you yourself can picture being in his situation then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be
also helps us keep in contact with others
they turn people into low life scums and criminals
the time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job your wasting it
this makes the cyclist think all hope is lost
to take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives
its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books
many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is
she does this i think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden
because you can get it on the go
the authors mood is very grateful
also the terrain was bad
she is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and shell have a different outlook on her new life
because you have to start your whole life over so you can get a job and provide for your family
so the computers have a positive effect on people
we should allow people to pick what they like
family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family
but with new computers they strive to meet every goal
the last reason is the most important to of family
the desert just made him want water even more
not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works
she means that even though she misses her homeland so much she is slowly getting used to her new home and her new life
i would have very friendly relations with all the teachers
but they can still be in there because some people might want to read them
this will come off offensive to many men and women
the setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate causing him to sweat profusely and requiring like to drink more water
a rich man without good health can not enjoy a good sleep
i do not think it should matter weather we have music movies or magazines in the library
they also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all
find something your parents like to do and see if you like
she will try the driving test again and the plant will overcome
who has forgotten about the past
people could also use less fossil
a lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat as far as knowing if it is offensive goes
a public library can but there are mostly adults there
just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home
they make it seem cool
the book still will be censored to be in that section or not but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much
these are how the authors see their work they want to show the people what they see even if does offend someone else
he is grateful they love and care for him
the mood in his home is always happy and thankful
where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible
all of these things can help you in a way
we have read about many conquerors like alexander the great julius caesar nepolean etc
he has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination
if you find a book offensive put back on the shelf and leave be
if they do not like it then do not read it
they be helpful but more hazardous
also if a student has a paper due the but their printer is broken they email the paper to the teacher
at some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
he writes i noticed the terrain changing
computers are used by many people to interact with another
people have their own opinions and views on materials
so i say keep computers here to stay
she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she will take it again
when we get ill she is unrest
i suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways
computers are sometimes dangerous for people
books that are found offensive should not be taken off of library shelves
everyone in the world has different opinions
he tactfully makes his student realize his mistake
where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be or placed into circulation
i think if their was no technology kids these days wont be beast
we should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening
he pedals great distances trying to find towns nearby
it put out a sense of family in the story
i have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors
the crowd was looking anxiously with gasps of surprise
people want to be able to do more than just talk
these are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for
this extensive use of technology creates a lack in their exercising habits they enjoy nature much less
for example say you like horror books
thank you for your time
in the excerpt it states
and here are reasons why people are spending less time exercising people not enjoying nature and less time interacting with family and friends
there are no buildings in site at all and no source of water
as you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries
even if you are able to put a censorship on books and music at a library you can censor the internet
we need to change this habit
have such a good lifestyle for them do you want to feel guilty for ruining that
computers can be used in schools to help teach students about new things
with racial slurs are offensive but to others it just shows how cruel and horrible the world can be
they get back their energy and feel relaxed
movies that are that offensive should probably be in a movie store that states that the movies are offensive and could be inappropriate
in conclusion computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses too much time on it and not doing other things
as you can see i have given you three reasons why i strongly believe computers are badly
this quote captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family
if you are like me you like to talk to your friends
recently the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir
it is better than because it is faster and more than calling someone up and talking for
people will always be offended
how would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are
before he knew it he was in debt
well then they can use their computer to stay in touch
the terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts
but when i wait for it to load i get bored and go on online game website
so every couple days he video chatted with me instead so i could talk to him
i had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings
so now you know that libraries are very strict
today computers allow us to communicate with one another access the millions of websites on the internet and help with school work
so people think that compute is fun for them
do you want to be that person
then we slowly begin to get unhealthy
but just then my son me to get one and i have the chance to talk to my family everyday
certain material such at rated movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable
it shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring
you can download videos print out photographs and charge and other electronics
there at one point he says can feel so cruel
she is always interested in i am reading
a woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid
i believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf
arguing in my family causes friction to the point where we become unsocial and turn to a computer
i bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library they would only have horror in the library
but today everything is done by machines
censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book song movie or magazine is found offensive in any way
he ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike
finally i would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out
all through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well
computers help out by making possible to get all the info you want like for a trip
but is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood
i would listen to the complaints of the students
now in this memoir he express all and also how proud he felt about his family
with that being said i have come up with what i believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries
so the mood in this poem makes you feel like home is where the heart is
computer have mark information then any book in the world
so she had to take it off
this goes with reading as well
the author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year
those are some examples of why i think the author concluded the story with that paragraph
i am writing to the newspaper about removing certain materials such as books music movies magazines and more
one of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in
when they come back i will take that test again
some material could be informational about our solar system or about the human body
also from experience i have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling
i like fiction stories then nonfiction
your family is always their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day
with websites such as and people can keep in touch
the mood is very warm and welcoming
however the cycle is a good source of the body
censorship is based on a opinion someone has
it starts becoming very hot and his water supply begins to decrease quickly
firstly computers are greatly changing the way people communicate
the pebbles that he found helps him out
finally she is grateful when they are leaving their house
people wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over
computers make life so much easier
i think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be
its bad for kids so stop it
books are needed for research
these are the kids that are likely to get bad cramps
we have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read
also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it offend them
the loves his parents because of their sacrifice and love
now i pose question to you if all was deemed offensive material what would be left
it has two big headlights
however i said that computer help people learn about thing that happen in the word
i exercise enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too
make it hard for them to do their homework
your choices are endless
people can send horrible messages to someone
if someone wants to read a book or watch a video they should be able to
also of adults staying is good
firstly they would check out sites to go to in
one should not be ineligible to a book or magazine or watch a movie
the desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow
is much more beneficial than learning how to type or talking to your friends
first of all just learning how to use the computer is a skill you need in life
not only that but his lack of water depleted his energy as well
they save work on their and they use computers to build things
she had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish
i thought to my self that they want to hear that from me
therefor the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children
the mood of this story is happy
although computer gaming is a big reason why kids go on the computer bullying is a huge factor along with stranger danger on chats
an example at the program can help us that they let us look information play game help with our homework
some history be gruesome and completely crazy but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them
those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
the two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through
if people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said
do you like to travel
if a book song or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children
to me the main source of communication is chatting online
it is better to use love and nonviolence
in they could go to world or the to learn all about how it is in a
many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature but i believe that enhances
i know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family
computers do have an effect on us but in a good way
i learn stuff from the computer and it is a fun thing to go on
they help adults stay in contact with their friends
they are all somehow offensive to certain people but not to all
there were different kinds of birds
she was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed
you learn so many good things from a libraries
computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much
the author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there or were there at some point
this creates hate inside of their hearts all because censorship was not used
but you have to go shopping
computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired
in hot weather the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight water could even evaporate
for example it is the desert and usually there is nothing there
his hopes start to drop
books are very helpful when it comes to essays or etc
one day i shall fulfill my dream and become a pilot
online also helps because you can pay bills to gave bank and it overall saves a trip to the bank a waste of gas
some computers uses tend to forget about the important things in life such as family schools work and their own health
this showed that the family was still in the country they were in now but before was good too
but why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family
what be offensive to one parent not be to another
kids can up facts about other countries famous people and even types of pets
reading this made me feel very thankful
the family had a close relationship almost like family with their friends
he goes from one street to another to sell his wares
i do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers
libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this
some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them but most of it is history
people need to know the true meaning of what is being said
he was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off
i firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer without knowing how long has gone by
after several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it they finally had him talked into it
i believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head
there was always one book that i remember the most named a light in the by
so you will have to wait
now to sum it all up if a book or whatever it be offends you in the library then i believe it should be removed from that library
dear computers are useful they have a negative affect on people
obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today
one way is to be respectful to people and people be respectful back
i like to read subjects such as murder files drug bust biographies and autobiographies
the lack of exercise is increasing fast
he means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with
some even give computers to kids so they can use it to study
i am going to tell you what i think about the books movies and magazines
if you were interested in nature you could learn about all kinds of nature around the world
have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it
he remembers his parents love for cooking and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him
dear the question is close too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings
there are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written
being allowed to write how they feel is what is practically based on
for for example was banned in public schools for some reason
did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer when the to learn a place or a person
voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now
we should not start swimming without thinking about our experience and depth of the river
i know this from some clues in the text
bad characters create a lot of trouble for all of us
first they help people learn by looking up information on different places
they are helpful can be used to give education and they can be used to interact with another
they could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored
if you have a favorite sports team band or are interested in a famous figure you have tons of information on them at your disposal
i found directions within a second using a computer
it told me was located in
another thing is the lifestyle
you can just take that person out of the world
as you can see computers have a lot of great uses
my friend when he was little would play outside for hours and hours at a time
people from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive
for example i have family in another country and one way we always talk is on the computer
if the use of computers was lowered anger that people have would lower and would lead to other positive things as well
the world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books
not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials
then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you
for example playing sports or even a simple task like throwing something in the trash
certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public
words do not exist that can describe how amazing those parents are to do what they did
school officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in
they were an immigrants
this shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die
so their for i think spending a lot of time on a computer is bad
that is unfair and should be stopped
it will also save you more money
how can writing be offensive
another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them
everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes
the settings of the cause effected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for the route and the route he took was not biker friendly
computers are getting in the way of everything
i think that one has there on taste in music
most of these dogs are high in their pedigree
libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not
most libraries have magazines because its for your entertainment and they want to keep you happy so you will keep coming back
to begin i will explain some problems in our libraries
if the cyclist were biking in the on a cold day in the mid he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke
libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking discovery and learning
if that happened there would be a very limited supply of books
do you think people spend to much time on the computer do
dear local newspaper in my opinion computers are a help to our plant
censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things
their are many dating sites such as that connect people losing that internet
you will see a small rainbow before you
it is everywhere books movies songs and television shows
are offensive then you really got to take action
it is a lot eager to the motivated when there is thing to look at to keep your mind of the attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst
you could also meet new people
dear newspaper more and more people in our proud and courageous country of have been
lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is
about of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life
so ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers
she is saying when the hibiscus returns she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it
i was born in a hotel kitchen
in the case of children careful censorship is necessary for healthy development
like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book its like taking away a good book from a reader
thank you for your time
people find it easiest to buy something with the click a mouse
the dewdrops on lush green grass and leaves of plants look like pearls
the computer saves us time and money to do these things
also the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things
in conclusion censorship should be kept in libraries
as the i wrote above i showed not even a fraction of what computers are good for
it reminded her of her old home
but i think that we need to find a balance between the two
this profession is not only arresting
it is hot cool out therethen the terrain changed
music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do
even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through
and this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you
she now realizing that she now by a whole new opportunity and life to start
so after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick
thank you for your time
lets get onto first point being social
this would help the public
one that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes
kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex
he had found a water pump
some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way
are they blaming it on computers
furthermore people can interact with friends over the computer
computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends
states shows of the natural disasters computer classified them
we used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics
it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope
to make sure they are who you think
computers helped people learn things besides racial ways in the past but also about there own culture
computers are very beneficial to society
no one really knows but we will try to stop it all we can
parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them
every body loves taking with their friends and family and this is made easier by using computers
my second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family
last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet
computers can basically be called a gateway to learning
the movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids
and look up place see
also the computer has mainly improved methods of
children need to see animals smell the sweet scent of flowers and feel the breeze brush against their cheeks
the following day both i and my sister went school
the age of innocence is getting younger every generation and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point
it is also a good way to communicate with you friends
why should we take down the books in the library
but soon i was happy to return home and change wet clothes
any time i look through the library i come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate
another reason is because everyone has their own choice about what they want to look at in a library
but i say they are wrong
not two miles into this next section of the ride i noticed the terrain changing
it runs on battery and plays soft music when it moves
talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another but computers again are preventing this
i know computers can help find information but personally i believe that books are better resources
first off on the computer you can talk to people
so i strongly you to vote being a negative effect
the heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke
computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips
some people think the type of words used in a book make it bad but to others that is what makes the book
do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over
books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in
computers can also be used for amusement
libraries have no right to censor books
lastly it could be bad to get though life without your friends and family
this is why i do not believe that censorship in libraries is not a great idea
so all the people of keep your computers they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology
this can lead to bad things like being stalked or kidnapped
we as a whole need computers to do daily life things without be able to go online or save files we would be lost
effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all
as the cyclist begins his journey he is confident exited to have been offered new directions from some old wise men which promise a shortcut
the same can be said for merry scenery too
but they can do it in another way other than taking the book off the shelf
the author express gratefulness by saying his grateful for his culture and the sacrifice his parents did
the word itself is a symbolism of slavery without it the book is not as powerful
a majority of people would say yes
in this piece the features were determined how the cyclist felt
whenever you need it
i felt safe and confident when i went jump to my hamlet
computers help find and get new
so from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood
they allow you to write efficiently and neatly
if i owned a public i would have rooms devoted to books that are for different age groups
online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with
but books cannot shout their values
if someone steadily talks about you or on a daily basis offends you people can get depressed
for one computers let people talk and socialize even if they are on different sides of the planet
and how his simple three room apartment has become a home
that would take a long time to even get the book let alone read it
if you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends
he was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate
dear newspaper you really think computers are that good
this memoir describes how grew up and his meaning of family
who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just down right boring
he went to find a book to look at and i went to find a good book to read
computers increase math skills and hand eye coordination to
this has become a problem
i had a similar experience once
movies that are bad should be taken off the shelf
if you need directions you can look it up on the computer
also it lets you communicate with family of friends in case of emergencies
many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen
i hope you think the same too
could use it for chatting online
many features in the setting affect the cyclist
people that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children
there are even systems now that let you say something and will appear on the screen
those are only a few of the reasons why computers are good for society
that means that it is open to anyone and everyone
we have gotten this far to go to the top
a few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated
for example adults can look up whatever they chose on the internet and so can everyone else of all ages
you could play talk to people like your friends
the libraries and the community have choices to not have a offensive book on the self
everyone says family is the most important thing right
everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books
you can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation
music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored in my opinion
especially being that children are steadily becoming obese and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable
i believe that certain materials such as books music movies etc
their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship
to one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion
well brother is going to in six months and i am going to want to talk with him
a test done by showed that teens will rebel times more than usual with the aid of a computer
but how were they put to use has little evidence
of people can access the web on their cell phone
not all people feel the same way
however their information is out of date and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads
people want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin
it could be happening with every letter you press
there are reading book sites all on the web
libraries should make sure the child is at the correct age to check out the movie
and photos about the mountain
do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature
could mean she realizes what happens happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want
to me computers are helpful yet extremely vile
using computers to type are also faster than writing a paper
first the town the cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town
also people would want to learn about other people cultures
it was dry and hot and he had no water
the cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride
this would help you because at age people are dependent on computers
you look at her she looks at you she walks away
in the story rough road ahead the setting and the features affect the cyclist
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist
if we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them then there would be no books left
eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke
it also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them
in the next paragraph i will talk about magazines
mainly it falls on parents on what content you want your kids looking at
you be outside you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much
this allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others
with books people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book
wondering what is the best way to get somewhere
computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family
students freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries
the heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance
kids should no the limit
i feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer
in society today people take things in very many different ways
i feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries
this means that the day is hot and running out of water
to each person that finds the material offensive there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all
also he loved that his parents thought them so many things
computers also let us communicate with family and friends
nevertheless computers are dangerous
when you were a child how much did you learn from books
most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening
just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone
because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get away and relax the self at the library to read
i however believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth or adults
that world is not a world i want to live in
dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle
i could drop from heat stroke another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is
because you want to get back to the computer
the computer is able to do so many things
only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human
computers allow use to play games and learn about almost anything
the social networking groups are for abilities to talk to friends long distance or close and family enjoy research
you want people to lock a respect for nature
take the books that contain offensive material or be inappropriate for those younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library
the purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff
a lot of peoples time
also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke
i feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not
if you have a computer or a laptop and you need to find information on something the internet is there
the features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures
also it would be the best choice
we learn keyboarding skills
the use of this technology can old people in discovering so many new things they have never known before
now the content of some books are not always appropriate
second computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily
therefore the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path
in fact of all the people in this who owns a is addicted to computers
my mom is always on face book and i hate it i figure she loves the computer more then do you want your kids to think that about you
all computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it
without the internet planning vacations would be close to impossible
another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment
the obvious answer is bad effect
he tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water
for example a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it
when she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home
email has also been very beneficial to society as well as helps people communicate and plan events which brings me to my next topic
if you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online
dear local news paper i think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age
on the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go
one computers let you surf online anytime you want
i hope you can agree with me
it gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and i can relate to that
a song book or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended
this is one reason why i think that computer have a positive effect on people
this emphasizes the characters total lack of resources
computers are used from leaning or for fun
trees are also very necessary for having good rainfall
i mean what do you think
the hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills
but we always want to know about their welfare
every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience
people that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out
making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others
you have read my reasons and you have realized what the computer does for the world
the library staff should take action and make a separate room for
items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out
libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see hear and read certain things
he also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go
do you have a favorite interaction website
the reason he is happy i think is because he has a family that loves him
this shows that the temperature most of been unbearable
the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh
dear newspaper in think that computers are not good for the society
libraries are targeted toward every age group and censorship just allows everything to be appropriate for everyone
something you can see your family for webcam
even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children there will not be a lot of books left
children exposed to at least hours a day to compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are times as likely to develop such possibilities
the constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well
they are a magnificent thing
the setting of the cyclist was harsh the weather was too intense to be cycling your heart out all day
just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups
dear in a pole conducted by the people agreed that computers are a easier way to research than going to a library
you can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead
with the click of your mouse you can check to see who won the presidency or what shows are on tonight
the movie could be rated but the parents still check it out for them
nothing have to right to write about anything they want singers have the right to sing about what they want
the temperature caused the cyclist to sweat
once i spent all night on the computer and the next day i failed a test
almost everyone is effected by computers in some sort of way
it would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left
any of these websites can ford photos to their mobile device
in some schools they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home
he realized that birth life and death bring only sorrow to mankind
i hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts
removing material from the shelves make some people happy but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable
in conclusion being dehydrated tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had
it is very beautiful
due to their role the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible
she said now all the new things seemed weird to her when she first got here but now they are second nature to her now
it would be a boring world
the cyclist faced some problems while on the journey
i use to spend three hours online everyday
the music i am with it being taken out of the libraries
three have been other cases in which girls have sent a nude pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and other people soul it
people can hack into almost everything
libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out
the had many mood in the memoir
just like the hibiscus flower and the geese
offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it
the mood created by the author is touching
also you can chat on or
so though you think computers teach no they can coordination for the rest of a persons life
you can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them
while some books are censored because of shame some are censored because a certain group of people find it offensive
they find it out of place or offensive
my three reasons are to look up information homework and talking online to friends and family
i used to think that talking with someone
there are not a lot of songs in the world that do not involve language drugs or sexual content in it
she still talks to the people in high school but she mostly talks to her older sister
having applications released that connect people over the computer devastates the reason to leave your house
i hated seeing my friend like this but mostly i hated how i watched it happen
he had accidentally fallen into the pool
he first comes to a ghost town where he finds no one is living
items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered
if they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well
next when the cyclist comes to one ramshackle shed several rusty pumps and a coral he knows that things are in bad shape and he water
in my personal opinion i believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose
he showed in the passage the warmth and love in his home
she is saying there is everybody has a certain opinion they take offense to different things
using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier but their is on even greater one
this is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor
also shows things about your personal info
you can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live
and by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful
in the end either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people
obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health their eyes are being damaged also
they are useful to us in many ways
for exam pull has news about what is going on in the world
some libraries not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others
but there are many other types besides rap
movies are something you have to look out for too
so seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone i got most of the other volunteers to help me
the whole house was reduced to ashes
you still have time to change your life and say no to the computers
lastly we rely on computers too much which leads to problems
the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf
well not only is a job being completed but you are also exercising i remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay
there is absolute peace without the noise of motor horns and hawkers
so this is why i think computer are helpful but a waste of time
all websites that can stay in contact with your best friends
so because the computer has different links and websites it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast
so go get yourself a computer and amazed
or be active learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you
i got down from the bus
the setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly
after months the fit and healthy became obese
books magazines movies music etc are all good to read watch or listen to
is a website teenagers of kids go on to watch some of their favorite music videos
therefore i believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of
but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else
the author also loves his family
he then faced his next problem
while these children are young they do not know what is bad for them
another thing is a computer allows you to talk online with other people
the computer has also the way of communication
that when i have issues seeing where they think they have the right
books that deal with slavery also be found offensive like the book
how does she feel about it
having a computer is great to play games
you can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad
these three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage
the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons
even after that were more problems
if we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else there would be no more movies left in the world
everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like
chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly but they can also be dangerous
but how do you know if people are who they seem to be
in the memoir the author created a mood
this last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change
minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read listen or watch
the hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her because they reminded her of home
the book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it
when we read we find books that are to our own enjoyment we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads
the hibiscus shows it with its budding stage
in conclusion i believe that the library has a right to own books or movies that are somewhat offensive
another reason he is proud is because his parents would help give so many people home to stay in
computers are helpful in many ways they can be an information post
you know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well
also the cool thing about a computer is that there are websites that let you talk to your friends that live near you
censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate
so these one some of the main reasons why i say that the computer is not always a good because people spend a much time on them
do you really want people to lose their friends
the operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits
a computer gives you any learn something
that is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
also keep out of kids reach
this is just one reason i support computers
have to look up something on the computer some jobs you have to apply by computer lastly allows you to talk online with other people
the final paragraph seals the deal as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about
they could become obese and possibly get diabetes
one of my interests in reading i had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science
the library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well
she finally had something from home that she could hold
this is what i think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves
in my opinion i believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves
it showed her getting used to her environment
all are very fun things to that you could be missing out on learning of the computer
the tent was decorated with colorful lights
if people buy the books that mean the libraries get money and the more books people buy the richer the libraries becomes
i would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find
i do watch them but i would never watch them around my younger sister
many people have different views and opinions on things
i think that it was there home and each other because they have there home just as they like like like when they were back home
these offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture
people have computers and go on them daily
the cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun
computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else
communication is very important in everyday life
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that of gratefulness and happiness
a few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is
censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history
ten who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with same one a thousand miles with no mail or telephone or whats over
this shows that the tone is thankful for what the parents had done and love them at the same time
should books magazines movies and music be put in higher reaches of children or should they be left in plain sight
and you can read your favorite books via online scans now you be wondering why not pick up a real book
i still feel frightened when i remember the accident
people have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting
technology is all around us
the book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it
his description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness
i believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style
the second reason is that not all people agree on censorship
did you know that information on the internet is wrong
he created a mood very uplifting and loving as if to say your childhood and family is the heart of your home
can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous
there even be a possibility that some books not necessarily just books hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to
i find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book movie or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible
secondly why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner
they promise you and make you believe to get you ideal things for your money
you better get yourself a laptop before the next giant essay comes
libraries should not remove a book music movie or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive
with computers come the internet and with the internet comes games and social networking sites
most people have there own type of everything
finally our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether
and that brings us to music
while they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life
the terrain was long and straight then turned into tall hills which had to be difficult to ride
do you think that these golden ideas are bad for our society

its their business and they decide what materials stay and which ones go
of teenagers say they talk to other peers using or
everyone knows computers addictive

if i were to call her each call would cost
some say there should be some do not
in paragraph the author says how he will always be grateful for his parents and the life that they gave him
in their neighborhood all the races were together in unity despite the customs else where
first i think books that contain violence should be removed
i am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library
a computer helps the victim by giving them a better feel on their environment
there are some material out there that no one wants a little kid to get a hold of
as you can see this is my first reason as to why i believe computers are positive
they help social lives teach us skills and give us information on countless topics
yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home
there can be different censorship on individual people too
if something was removed every time someone would walk in then there would be no library
first of all how offensive can library material truly be
if we can learn from other mind sets through books music movies and movies then i think we should be aloud to
says to the new advancements in technology people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds
this quote about forty miles in the pedal i arrived as my first town

computers are the best way to research a topic

movies are also carried in some library but not every library carries a movie
it refreshes the mind
who can say where it should stop
the author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for
the cold weather is an obstacle for them
these ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place
i think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out
its not a pretty site accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability
some say kids are like sponges
i believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph
there are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject
there are multiple solutions to the problem
let alone not even be there to begin with
there maybe somethings out there in this world that you think are offensive but have you stood up and told that company yourself
i feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not
hiking is a popular part of a parks and can be performed by all ages so go out and spend a weekend in the great outdoors

all the neighbors are fed up with this family
also do you remember when was the time to put the alarm clock on for
certain books provide an escape for some teens and even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives
first reason is that what if you had a child and wanted he or she to see the same movie or book you did when you were little
that is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis
however i think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family to use the computer for educational purposes and for entertainment
even just typing is interesting for younger kids

dear i have been informed that recently people are questioning the use of computers
however some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them
of course not all users have a computer for information
so you should really be consider judging the skills of the computer they really do help in life
whether we are learning about criminals racism or wars there is always going to be one person who is against it all
so much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use
offensive thing can hurt a persons feelings and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book
the library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for
another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life
computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can
libraries they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them
through all of this they have returned little to society
one of the much enjoyed pieces of technology
instant messaging and are now primary sources of communication
i think computers are a great way to have fun
then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book

soon thereafter the cyclist notices something is amiss
there are shops for repairing damaged things also
everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials

because the author is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her
you can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country
to conclude computers greatly benefit us and are good
the people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece

example imagine having to do your research using only books but you live far a library
the material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children sake
in some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see
as you can see using then internet can be very helpful if you used to the right way

what affected the cyclist most i think was when he arrived at the bait store

by using computers i have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial
soon he was carried away in a car
teenagers that listen to music from or are getting bad messages
in my opinion computers are one of the most important things to a person
also if you find out something new tell people you can spread the knowledge
give them what they want
things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people
my library would have something like this in the library
she uses geese as a symbol for spring when she would start preparing for this test once again
as i stated in paragraph two that i used to be a user

one condition on why a bookmoviemagazinemusicetc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it
they teach us life long lessons
has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computer in their school
so really either way you try to remove any material that you think is offensive but is it your right
but now they use there computer many things can go wrong
even if you and call some one they not be home or answer
especially if you had read the book yourself and found nothing wrong with it

some readers who read such things can turn those words into action
however she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person
when exposed for a long time exercising and running out of water the effect is even greater
people from all over came and be apart of the family and it was alright with them
make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely
without books there would be no real sort of entertainment
i know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but i think computers have a positive effect on people
saves money and time
computers can help people become interested in these different topics and be even inspire some people to go to these faraway places or hack different people
stay in one room doing the thing for books for a in a while people need fresh air

of the population of said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen
in addition jobs have been lost from this had economy
no books are allowed to be read by the people
my second reason why i think the effects of computers is good is because you can contact friends or family that you have not seen in a while
everything from music on the radio to military files are censored
you can find info about there future person they can look up there
some were reading newspapers
in many cases certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them
but the time spent kids getting bullied and the now lack of social skills is not worth it
with that being said why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with
she has a lot of knowledge about books
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips

having a computer will give kids the action to sit around and do nothing
these are just some of the many ways computers are helpful
individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room
they just do not feel comfortable fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them
these books should not be taken away from the library shelves
another example would be a book on religious purposes
when kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search and saves time

when the censor things it makes me angry
i have a small beautiful garden at my home
the second girl asked confused
it is one of my most prized possessions
lastly the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist
computers even have websites of a dictionary were people can look up words
the book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request
no one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem giving a safe feeling
the reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising
here instead of the songs of birds i heard the cries of hawkers and vehicles
computers improve reflexes and such but you can do that by exercising also
dear local newspaper you know that computers teach you to do many things
lastly the mood is loving because in his home his parents welcomed anyone who needed help
the computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge
all books should remain on the shelves
if you found a book in your public library offensive would you want that book removed from your sight and public view
the green fields looked very beautiful
lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers
the hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills
it helps me think what i am going and calms me down
by playing games we can use what we learn in real life
learn about many places and communicate with friends and family
yea has a but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion
when i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on a
communication is a vital part using computers
you cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves but what you can prevent you should
also in cars there are computers to run just about everything else
in my experience some music is just too offensive
me as a child a is throwing me off of my homework
the real world is not censored so books should not be either
most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time
another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left
its just a way of life
my family always does stuff together like board games and what not
if were to look up information about the government on the internet that person would not find a lot of useful information
imagine those kids the night before scribbling words away with their cramped hands typing to write as quickly as possible
people need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone
whenever he sees a stray dog a cat or a bird he
more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
also talking to friends online is fun too
reason why i think you have family from far away
anything can make someone change and in order to have that chance we should have the freedom to read what ever we would like
some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries
the newspaper news and internet make events appear worse than what it is if it refers to certain people they take it offensive
he braved the elements and forced himself on with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him
they also show unity by explaining how close everyone in his neighborhood and family are
the computer enables people to stay entertained and relaxed when needed
these reasons are why i think a computer is a positive technology
our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch
my little brothers like to play shooting games on the computer they are only years old
but other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it
i share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible
they never come out of their rooms and if they ever do then they are normally very cranky
it could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you
it is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that paint the picture of the future of our world
the reason why i say is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong and you can handle it if is wrong
or would you really want to do that to someone else
someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures ancient history on them and learn so much
they have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like its a book about or something
the author is being grateful here when she recognizes the house she has lived in the house her parents have worked so hard to get to
interacting with friends and family is important for everyone
eating for hours each day to not a good idea
shes saying by next spring shell take her test
whoever thought that learning would be fun
kids have been caught looking at porn buying illegal drugs hacking into systems and other criminal type things
the features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time
you would want a computer to help
i believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children
computers are part of everyday life and needs to be told about
playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family
however the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it
they can write about the good the bad violence crimes love and romance
if one finds a book offensive look in a different section
to me it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good
every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact
when he got to the second town i notice the terrain changing
he was very thankful for their giving arms to anyone who needed them and for their warm attitudes and teachings of what family really defines
first and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems
this is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life there are plenty more
the kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it
for example in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is
what do you think i think so
these boxes can be harmful to their users eyes
for example some people use it to go to college online
also some of the music that is on shelf should be remove from all store
that to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now
the same difficulty in the road
i want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier
for example suggest family
it also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake which added to his thirst
that will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will
plantation owners of the south raised a strong objection
you should not want costumers reading it and feeling disgusted
it brings a very warm feeling about you
one of the most common and used thing around the world is instant
i believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary but i also feel it must be kept in check
ironically the building was a grape juice factory abandoned and rusty but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable
everyone has different taste we wont ever agree on anything
also i think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard
gaining weight pink eye from staring at the screen do i have to go on
most importantly computers ruin many relationships with friends and family
using computers billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before
last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline
everyone is offended by something
since this helped i have been over to his house about times this year as to every
people would stop listening to that negative garbage
during the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions
a rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go
which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water
everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf
that is how the setting affected the cyclist
these reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans
some parts of the world do not get very cold mostly because of the influence of the sea
however for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our and deprive them of that information
certain materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person
this would make it very difficult to interact and make new friends
the first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to
fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author
this gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need
go call up a friend and do something fun i hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea
he ended up getting a on the test because he used a computer
eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people
in conclusion the books should stay on the shelves
the cyclist comes to the first town but only finds yet again no water and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty
when thinking about a topic like this you must look at a greater picture
internet is a virtual library you can search videos books magazines and music
there are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above
the feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough
on that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting
lastly computers allow people to communicate through internet
there were books about politics religion sex and violence
the authors should not be punished just because someone is offended by what he or she wrote
if everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate there not be anything left for people to read
computers allowed more jobs to be made and replaced
their family their job
this empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty
in all of my years i have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library
especially students do this they do their homework under the leaves to help them relax
typing helps kids learn the alphabet learn what the letters look like and shows them where the keys are
so what do you think
the one with the computer logs any searches for the reason and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports
they diminish so bad increases and the need for increases
also if kind of surgery on it and that will cause you from doing almost everything with that one hand
you just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are
i do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves
the mood is happy proud and grateful
this also could show that it is hot because he thinks its a mirage and people usually see them in the desert where it is hot
they would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the and maybe even across the globe
the cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump
its a debate that has gone through several libraries over the content of the material
so how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view
should we take off books that are offensive
a lot of people use computers in present day
in conclusion this is why i think that computers are a positive effect on people
yes they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool
i think that books should be censored
people say that this music helps them calm their anger down
she states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again
it also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in
why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country
do something else than be on
hes really not happy about listening to them and not following his map
but if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them then you my friend have absolutely no standing on the situation
my grandparents came from montreal to attend my birthday party
no nobody wants that
i see only a few good points in censoring
i think that having computers is a great way for kids like me to learn more about things in the world
what difference did it make
it has opened employment exchanges in all cities
in the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening
as he forms out most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water
to one might argue that the that stood by was loved by
in conclusion if even more censorship was done to public libraries libraries would be used less than they already are
computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made
a lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them
you have the choice not to read them or to read them
the answer to solving this problem to me is black and white children should just not pick up those types of materials end of case
dear local newspaper you know people are starting to buy and own computers
and when they got here they had to start fresh and take any jobs they could find
there are hundreds of stories in the world classics which tell us many immortal comradeships
have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around
imagine life without a computer what would you do
almost everyone has one that they use
interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email
internet use was always available interaction of online chat
this technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public
is noting wrong with that
when you use a computer you can read articles about the place and also get pictures and use them in a slideshow or photo story
i strongly urge you to take action to start reduce time on computers spent
why not just call or meet up with person instead of using the computers
the economy is very bad but you can look for jobs
one problem with show was that my dad loved show as well and tried to get my mom to like the show
this is social time lost
for music if it has an sticker you have to be over to rent it
these books are too old for a elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading
did you know that of our jobs in the is mostly about using a computers
i believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people
all of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has
books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone
it gives a deeper look into information about these things
the features effect the setting of the story in a big way
everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers
but instead they get too addicted to and that they forget about their school work and their priorities and their grades start to slip
there is punk etc like i said i could go all day on music
so in my opinion the library should be a good use to everyone and leave the books magazines etc
medicine constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers
what makes you think you should get any special treatment
internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away
finally i would like to tell you about the cruise ships you can go far away like and many more
kids these day have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by staying on their computer and play their computer game
any way a computer is used has the potential to have a positive effect on someone
what appear to be justified in their minds due to their beliefs might cause an uproar from others
finally people should stop using computers as much as they are now in order to keep their safety safe
every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed
internet could be blocked for certain websites
say that you need to research the periodic table and write down facts as well as all the elements
learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life
this is the mood that was conveyed by the author in the memoir
so try to get exercise hang out with your friends family and enjoy nature
she also spent on a plant because it remind her of back at home
i do not agree with this
when you get exercise you can lose weight
i would also say knowing some things are good but be careful of knowing too much
the individual does not need edited objects or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended
he starts out good then comes to a rough road and he even says sometimes life can feel so cruel
another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online
no one is ever going to be able to control what our youth see
i think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children
well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier
was a musician composer writer public speaker and human activist
the violates the separation of church and state
if they were to remove these books adults would then have to find a book online
the mood that the author created in this memoir is a happy emotional and and caring
if you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass
there will always be rude things that have been said but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it
by your side even through your worst
the setting brought him fear but he made it through
we should not drive our vehicles very fast
offensive media is everywhere
some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road and a shake was in his way
not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have
that was how things were back then so who are we to hide it
one thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend
such a novel though containing offensive language at times would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed
some people abuse these rights and people get in trouble
but as i said i hope i made my point clear and i hope you agree with me
they benefit our society in many ways
more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals
it involves sacrifice of time and thoughts
those days computers have all the websites like twitter and others
therefore by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read you are giving up your freedom
for instance one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy
some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits
there are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world
censored material can have bad influences on children
nothing in this world exists without opinions
is only six about to be seven
when someone spends months or even years on writing a story they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long hard work
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful
there come a point when things just become too much
any advertisement that show explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public
computers is a good benefit for people
suddenly he stopped issuing tickets and refuse to accept the one rupee note as it was slightly spoiled
but in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful
computers are helping people more than they are hurting them
which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test
a great example of a media material that is challenged every day in every part of the world is a book called the bible
lastly they have more success
that is all i am going to tell you
i am going to tell thinks way
censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose
the rice plant needs a lot of mud and water in the early stages of growth
finally computers allow people to talk online with other people
if a reader does not agree with what the author is writing or they find it offensive they should not read the book
also you can refrain from making a trip from the store by purchasing items online
learned a lot in this house and is very happy for that
we cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship
firstly those who are always on the computer need to exercise more they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong
you can also look out to nature
a study made by students at shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are dropped almost in people that use computers often
computers help of future learn with all these learning websites will be able ti teach them solves new things
this creates areas of gray where there is no right answer
the flower reminds her of home which is comforting after she failed her drivers test
it is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it
for example most schools have their students use computers for research
if you are a responsible person then you are fine
in our country we are allowed to express our opinion by the
the most you let your child watch is
doing everyone a favor
even though they can be use for many things like research
there are many different programmes every day on television
society possess a big problem
having computers it absolutely helps us learn whatever you needed to learn a computer has it
it is well known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away
the last mood that their was was harsh and sacrifice
it is our moral duty to help to the weak the hungry and the suffering people
at one point in the story the author writes that he was trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
if everyone could pull off a book or magazine etc then there would be no books left
the author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination
libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone
movies are rated for a reason to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate
and there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics
your screen fills with choices of information sites
i showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place
for example if you are a student you need to do a project
when you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen
now you just need certain information and in those sources there are an unnumbered amount of lessons to learn
the weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned he could not stock up on water
the mood of this memoir is warm and friendly
in fact religion might be the most important issue
most of the time it was just about a group of people who love each other having a good time with each other
there is something about music that soothes the human body
also what you are in a band or a group and need to contact them while you are out of town
they allow easier research i can learn about other countries and can talk to people online
the features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways
for example writing on essay their science fair project and so on
he even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration
i think that there are some people out there for example myself who like to watch movies and read books about slavery the holocaust etc
this should not be allowed yet it is
yesterday when i was on the computer i got bored and did some random searching and in that min
all in all the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end
awarded by the president
they even decided to check the magazine out
teenagers especially they get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff
look what they have given us today
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in this essay
computers is probably their or way they communicate
we need to code books for different ages
this i think can help with the problem
the mood is also family because when someone needed a place to stay from their family they would let them stay at their house
so if you want to read a book with no censorship or if you want censorship then you can
the communication is also great for businesses
i think they are very great to have
if computers never exiled the world would no doubt be better all around place
we have troops fighting for our freedom of press and freedom of speech and censoring books completely ignores these wonderful freedoms our country has given us
someone should not have the right if a book seems offensive to that person but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes
the setting in the story affected the cyclist
as unique and intriguing as the computer might be it is slowly destroying the mind
if we were given the right to remove and books movies magazines etc
these feelings are subjective almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate
parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things
but the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a rusted water pump and this troubles him because he is running out of water
the airplane started flying down
its the real world the adult world
developments that have been made by researchers inventors artists and writers were once possibly deemed as risk
they all rely on trees to survive
i wish everyone would do the same
computer classes and computinga computer is a
even movies and music can be offensive to some people
going on the computer can have a negative effect on you
some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from
my other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended
speaking of which computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays
it is part of what is great about this country
my brother was having problems with learning about the seasons but with one click he was full of knowledge
information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace
in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist
everyone should have a because you can play any types of game
others find some books music magazines and movies offensive because of the terms people use
he maintains order and peace
it does not seem fair to me
computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring
he is a caring young boy
when their playing tag and hide an go seek so movies books music and magazines play a big part on the way they behave
for example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place
they help you write essays grades charts ex
everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight
you can find this all out on the computer
if you stair at something for too long it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because your trying your eye lens
there are some names for instant and many more
for a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us
however i have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song
children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays
so reader these are some ways why people should enjoy computers
you might end up being lonely
the intense heat rough terrain the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task
so computers do benefit the society
but computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them
however all you can find are those generic articles in old books
the setting is very important in every story and can change everything
these things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike
now people have color televisions
sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation
on the second day when i still could not ride i started crying
which for children education is largely what their childhood is for
according to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him
the setting had a hot sun no trees and no water
she realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail
healthy grateful and diplomatic we are slowly losing important
in the story the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed
in all the students in grade ten just got done reading of
instead they are sitting chair starring at a computer screen
i know kids in school use foul language all the time
everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to
we should keep movies there is no doubt in my mind
the mood in the memoir is very happy
the question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good
he did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town
they are concerned there is way too much computer time
they have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art
well you be right but also wrong
it can be very distracting dangerous and unhealthy for not exercising
this way you are not completely removing it but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it
she also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of home
i have never been there so i want on the computer
he had to enhance these extreme
how would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert
i hope you are for the mind tips and family
she will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring
computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there
i know you might think that computers can make families get further apart but they actually bring them closer together
what are the conversations mostly about
the growing mind and body needs to move and exercise
people like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened
time my computers crashed and i had a report due but all the books were gone
this does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because that there are some people who dislike them
the statement is true people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information quickly than the library
more kids would be educated so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff
by censoring the speech of authors their rights have been denied
computers help us do all of that
pg this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again
i think this is the mood the author used in the memoir
in today many young get raped
it would make you anxious to read it
personally i believe that computers benefit the society for many reasons
if we censor the books in our libraries then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture
some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings while others over the same topic believe the complete opposite
the flower represents determination using the flower to show her own determination
overall material in a store is public and for anyone who comes into the store
what would the world be like if children went around with these things
that will save a lot of your day and it will save a lot of you money
my opinion on this subject is its not right
well good for you mission accomplished
people yell at first
i believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive
what is education for
the way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful
the author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else
my father and his father has all of their records in a safe
it read rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
when i go onto the computer for only minutes my eyes start to water
but if they have a computer they can just google the information
books are a very important part of most peoples daily lives
computers help us do research they keep us connected with friends and family and they are required to be used at some
in the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him
my mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to
if others find that offensive then that is their problem
i think as far as the child part of it that no children should not be aloud to read things that be vulgar sexual etc
at the library i go to they have any kind of book music movie and magazine you want
there is no reason to have a whole community ignore an authors work just because a large group of people do not agree with what it says
this shows that she really is adjusting to her new home and has hope for when spring comes and the geese return and hibiscus bloom
some people might not care about the things they see and some do
first there are many families who have at least one member who lives in a different place
going there he regained his strength and learned his lesson never take road advice from other people
you know that and the people who make computer sites know that
because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on
so here i am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society
we are letting the children of grow up to fast and introducing them to things way to early
eventually the world will have no art left because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone
rough roads did as well
the time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers
just think if they would have censored those ideas
so much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous
the roads became bumpy and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over
language usage in music is also a big deal
the author is most proud of his parents because of tier love and sacrifice
in this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so
this poses a problem because it is very dry and hot
you should have a section for children in libraries
although this is not always the case it does increase the chances of wrong decisions and it does have and influence on the younger minds
dear readers i believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons
also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store
our learning our beliefs and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship
they can help you do anything
they are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in
computers are a common household item these days
they move in public places
i think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
movies and books can easily be censored
parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started minutes ago
you cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them
next spend less time enjoying nature very important
obviously nature is ignored by society because of computers
studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to more free time to do whatever they want
this also includes music movies and magazines
since the whole story portrays this mood i will tell you some reasons why
it also effects him because he had an advantage
the author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass
the books from the movies like the side
there are baby books kids sections teenage and adults sections as well
obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country
his father also lives with him
if you throw the candy away what does that mean for the other party guests
these books can also be accessed by children
the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affected the cyclist in the story
chairs were arranged for the parents and other guests
culture and history are two very important aspects of the world
i don’t allow anyone to pluck flowers from my garden
specifically baseball
on i went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him
yes i think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio
even kids who go to school need to use the internet of the computer for something like a project or homework
you just have to find a way that benefits you most
get with the program computers are in
you take it as it is being independent
therefor computers do have a positive effect on people you can stay communicated updated with the latest news and have an advance education
this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from they always welcomed each other
and discovering the latest news

she means that when everything returns and proves they survive she will too
kids spend to much time on computers
for example movies can be a comedy mystery or adventure
that means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be
some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see
you have a choice to read or watch something
for example you can communicate with people conduct business and you can use it to learn
my conclusion is we need computers to survive without them we will be in the stone age still
he got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth
that gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world

it is there and part of our life
as this paragraph shows internet and computers open more then ever before
i was very scared in the beginning

the day was a good day and wants to take the test on the same day
everyone gets offended
all of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for
i would keep all types of books in my school if i were the principal of my school
begging brings a bad name to the society and country
yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world but people have to worry about what is right in front of them
technology lets everyone explore new topics
the mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood
he goes jogging every morning and takes me along with him on weekends
if you play an instrument and you need music to play to why not go to the library to get some
with a computer you can also learn about places all over the and the world
its not right and its not fair
if all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past
in all fairness is an educational novel about how times were in the day of and
here are my reasons why
movies are censored due to language and content which i get but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen
so maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck i think
i do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and find different types of work offensive
at first she gets nervous and scared so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces
i have cousins who live in and because of the hour time difference its not always easy to talk on the phone so we use the computer
i would read books or i would put a puzzle together or something
the content in libraries offensive or not should not be removed
the fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little said a curse word in front of them
some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things on library
well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future
in the everyone is given the right of free speech
first i believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries there would not be many books left on the shelf
do you want your kids like that
can you see now why i believe that having computers around is good
you look back and regret doing what you did
while can be debated that computers are bad i firmly disagree
but how will we be able to do that if we only email and
some site like allow you to instant message your friends
libraries should not be censored
it happens every day every place
and because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out
there are some movies out there that are just so funny i could quote ever line of it
however if it is offensive to the first person it does not mean it will be offensive to the next
how would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that
did you know that of has a of
writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams
the author now had a solid thing to remind her of home
the computer also helps out with adults and their jobs
statistics show that around of children under years of age are obese
third reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because some people find jobs online
the boy did not know how to swim
finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family and friends
can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime
these are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and i hope you keep using them in our community
there are many entertaining website online that you can go to when you bored
they choose to over use the computer and too much of any thing is a bad thing
seeing that elementary kids are not as mature as say an adult or a high school student their level of reading is not as advanced as ours
my first reason not everyone should use a computer is because they get so distracted in the computer they forget about school
they can teach people many things
in all honesty yes let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting
i book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive
someone tells you something it goes in one ear and out the other
computers can keep friends together and save families from drifting apart
for example a book that you think is boring could actually be interesting to another person
i have written in response to the letter sent to me on the topic of electronics
books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts
there are millions of people that play games on the computer
i would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community
there is something in each that strikes a spontaneous appreciation
he should be taught to think before he acts to be prudent and useful to his society
to sum this all up i would like to tell you local news paper that you should agree that computers are a good thing for the society
you are probably thinking computers sound so childish and infantile
the rode was all messed up
the factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist
many of spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday
i do not agree because the books should not be gone for good
the is all computerized today and that is a major trade way today
lastly if you really want something or need it just shop online
how would you feel if your child fails school gains weight or gets kidnapped because of the computer
but you most likely are going to need a credit card
people of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines
in you get exercise and can expose the scenery
our teacher also encourage us to use computers
you must understand how important this technology is to our society
he was sure he was going to die right there right now
the setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die
next computers help us with our school work
in other words computers are just a negative waste of good money
i hope you agree on my topic
also you can talk to friend
they could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories
everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online
some people prefer to write than type but other people prefer to type than write
they provide books movies magazines music and computers for you to locate something you are looking for
using the computer is good to do or not using the computer helps people be able to interact wild people that so easy to talk to
if the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would nothing left to read and the intelligence of children would drop dramatically
first of all people are on the computer way too much
that should prove that computers are very help full
they are both rated differently on levels of age
what if i was to say offensive books
for my first reason goes along with personal values
she also mentions the geese for the same reason but in a different way
be removed from libraries if they are found offensive
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
they live by themselves
the visual and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of your struggles seem so much more beautiful
i say this because in every situation either one side benefits both sides benefit or neither side benefits
people can only choose what they want and nothing more
emails are an example of this
books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing
not books that i know can search a topic show you pictures and videos of it with one resource
i would wellequip the laboratories
i do not agree that computers benefits society
this stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip
the games teach you different things about history
this is how i feel on the matter of getting ride of books
if you have to do a project over something like food and cant use a computer magazines are a great way to get good pictures
i think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did to show that you can always change
i think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen
also books are usually funnier to read
the features of the setting affects the cyclist
i can honestly say i was supposed to choose one
you will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing
finally i would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers
and hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society
some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert
another example is that overtime the strain build up and up to the where even with glasses you can hardly see
those are some of the major advances caused by the computer
she provides us milk and bullocks for the agriculture work
his english pronunciation is very impressive
you would not believe the technology they have and how they use them
we do not need things like that in our world
taking materials out of a library i would have to disagree
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
you should have to be a certain age to rent this movie
very recently during the war in the news reporters were not allowed into towns and cities where a user uses being fought
i do think the books should be removed from the shelves but put somewhere else where a child could find it
so thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this
with some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across
perhaps we learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so
they can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable
the mood created in this memoir is love and unity
today in our society almost everyone uses computers weather to do research play games or interact with others
so why should you take the risk
this is why most jobs have computers
they never said what the books were but they kept talking about how they felt and what they would have liked to do with them
please do not remove anything from the selves because it will only do more damage
does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed
the time has come to decide
first things posted on the internet are not always true
magazines tend to go one way or the other
i know this because of the sign that he saw that said rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed
most of these books give a prospective on real life stories and be able to help someone cope and realize that they are not alone
this shows the closeness of the people in the neighborhood had and this represents the love as well
a variety of people could take offense to the content this contains
how would you feel if you lost that
dear newspaper i think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise
the could be years of to enter the room
every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life
some street beggars are very clever
their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons
so you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones
this caused him to become even more dehydrated resulting in him thinking he was going to die
they live in groups called pods and are very playful by nature
all living things need water to survive
the censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder it really better off this way
through reading the magazines and watching movies it could help you
it is a key item when someone is looking to travel
these technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people
it was nothing cool about it
this causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it
the boat was quit spacious though not a very big one
as he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty
also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment
in public libraries though these books should not be censored
the cyclist had to go through all these problems which made it show that he had determination
another effect computers have on kids is that stops them from spending time with family and friends
his mood starts to change very quickly
you can learn a lot from a offensive show you can learn what and what not to do
to me music is something more to express your feelings
in my mind we should all have computers because there fun and you can learn about everything you could think of so we should all have them
all those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading
i am going to hit points on what i think about the subject
in my experience censorship is a good thing to have
it is also hard to get used to climate change and learning another language
it brings a whole package
some people learn on computers
dear readers of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer and it has its pros and cons
sacrifice because his parents sacrificed their comforting home to move to for their son
he is a good cricketer
as teen who attends school i know that i would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer
if every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests there will be no material left
leisure can restore our energy comfort us and make us strong to work again
once the plant is bloomed she feels like she would as well and be ready for the test
and he looks at them
his parents had no knowledge of the language
of students at say that when assigned or paper or project the first source they use is from the internet
censorship is a major subject when dealing with books newspaper articles movies and other literary subjects
however that some of the websites are fake which is easy to great research to use for school projects
education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now
the library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age
it would make everything far less dramatic
next this is good for buyers and sellers
the cyclist is confident with himself at the beginning but after a few moments he feels really bad and learns a really good lesson
the setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence
if perhaps more books had ratings such as movies do an cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity
putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society
some people listen to certain types of music to calm their nerves down
authors publishers editors and directors all have a right to express their opinions in their work
i believe that music is a way that people express themselves
people have different beliefs
secondly computers are informational
well that could also be a reason people want materials removed
they just need to be move to a shelf were only bigger kids can get to
i do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries
so i decided to stop
one reason is that we have a lot more information on the internet
the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons
they live across the whole other side of the world
could use it for the and
the hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother
computers help people learn things keep in touch with family and friends
honestly careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves
the experts can say what they want but the computer is and always will be benefit to society
if things like this continue our planet will become mindless zombies will no personal opinions
one the internet there are many fun games for all ages
computers can help society and learning so help the growth technology today
then i have also seen accounts where people have been changed in a good way because of a book
it could be helpful to you and others
other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life
lets you meet new people without having to tell them who you are
this is opinion why computers are benefit for society
but i feel that we can find a balance between the two views
at first when the cyclist set off in the morning the conditions were great
you see many residents just dying to go to foreign countries but have no money
plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty
do you really want to take the learning experience away
magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music
suddenly we heard a cry of alarm
this memoir can pick the spirits up of any person in poverty that does not like the home they live in or their family
keep these things separate adult books magazine movies music etc
for example in the car with the
i bet there has been a novel a piece of music or a movie that you just love
i actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf
now i am going to tell you how everyone has computers
i think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights
you can do two things you can panic and let everyone down you can go or the internet and save
people seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words
kids in spent an average of hours on the computer each day while kids spend hours each day
i realized i have been wasting a lot of my math homework time lately with those online distracting game
finally they would check airports for flights going to and from
they get easy money by begging
secondly computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with real people
type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it
there are three reason on to here more
when on the computer there is no enjoying the outdoors
everything that we see hear and read is censored
that quote makes the mood of the memoir loving
secondly the computer distracts kids from homework
that means you could use it for your home work if you need help
the only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books
if you want to chat then you can use or instant messaging
the parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading
the community and the author that writes it should get more of the say then anyone else
therefore i believe that trying to stop people from this is a fruitless action
computers have an effect on people but in a negative way
nobody is forcing that person to read this book so why make a big deal about it
they are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms
he was grateful for his parents caring and selflessness
when you see things you want to do things just as the what the magazine
many other books exist as these
all you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too
my disagreement to the situation is that the its a library and libraries have different types of books
there were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes
also the computer has programs to help you manage expenses keeping you on top of your game
why should be removed from a library
here are three reasons why first would be that with advances in tech
so learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time
the employee pointed her towards the flower
he rings the bell in time
that my my opinion about why people should have computers
you have another virus
on the subject of movies are some that should be censored like the movies containing extreme violence or gore
i feel very strongly about my statement because everyone in this world is different
if they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise they would be fit and happy
libraries can not take the books away all together from readers who enjoy these kinds of books
every new year the company make new computers so they can get thousands or
my opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive
people say that computers waste our lives
now that is a big difference
he is reddish brown in color
it is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses
people all over the world are vastly different
after feeling that the direction might be rough he rode out of pride to get to his destination
these books were penned to educate our civilization
the next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed
the same idea can go with any topic in the world today
although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be
this basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors created a great place to live
everyone has a right to their own opinion
they will only go somewhere else and do it
if there is a song that you dislike then don listen to it
it creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things
it is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about
movies show us the ups and downs of life
these types promotes are in some of our books videos and other media
he reaches the school before school starts
for example if you we addicted to computers then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life
everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them
this shows how the author grew up helping people
my friends say computers are one the best technology because the internet can help a lot things like if you have research paper
action songs were sung
if you take away those books then you will be harming our societies ability to learn
these again are only some of the hundreds if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful
for example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry
example can study their math facts online math or learn about the skeletal system health classes
my father owns company and works from home most days
they say that the cons outweigh the pros
computers can be good in many ways but they can not be
it depends on the level of intelligence maturity and age of the people who have access to these materials
many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness
either way there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy
yes a friend a live and breathing human being losing some weight will help you gain confidence if you just try
many parents go hiking camping swimming and lots of other stuff but they that anymore
before the internet and computers it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work
now on to more about using computer for homework
more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers
of the people in school say their addicted to the computer and of the people in community say their addicted to the computer too
the effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved
this could lead to loss jobs laziness
the books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn to do things
in conclusion everything in our life offends us in some way
bad people are always lurking on the internet and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids
depending on how secure it could be life or death
many people have dream to one day build a computer or make new programs
same goes with books and movies even music and magazines nowadays and for certain people even bibles
the memoir is basically about family and how important family is
many find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive
instead of sending d letter to someone to invite them to the you could just email them
it was free and welcoming
how many humans inhabit the world today
the first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination
then it was a waste of money to make the building purchase the books for people and hire librarians
so learn experience and express
many young kids some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old go to parties and drink
there is also no risk of anyone reading your mail
there are kids sections sections and even a teenage section
every year thousands of students go to college and thousands of families move away from each other
the author concluded the story with that because she is saying that when the year starts off and starts over that she will too
it was happier because we know that he could have more life opportunities in
also teachers use it to help them teach classes and prepare materials for it
if we do not have technology then we can not call no one
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and happy
there is a reason why we are becoming one of the fastest countries
it seems today we attempt to censor everything but are we going too far
thick smoke was coming out of the house
i was led to my class toom
they have many different kinds of books for specific reasons
spending time with your family can be great fun as i recently discovered
in school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years
every sentence he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life
let the reader decide its value
another feature was the road sign that said do not exceed posted speed limit the speed limit was
violence can be created through anything and i feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that
hope was because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family
a child could easily ask an older friend to check the book out for them so they could read it later
as the journey continued the cyclist loses hope it seems
along with books many movies and magazines are also being taken off of the shelves because of offensive material
society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child so they know not to put it in any reach of children
now you know what computers are doing to the people of the
just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also
next i am going to talk to you about making friends just with a computer
everyone has their own style everyone likes different things and has different opinions
you can meet new people through online dating services
then many words would be gone
i define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person
it has came to my realization to find that many people would live long lives if they could not internet will friend
it could be their passion to write so why would you want to take that away
just to think that it was all because of one computer
music on the other hand is offensive to many people
if everyone read the same books listened to the same music and watched the same movies then we could have a very boring culture
books are suppose to be about learning
throw out you can live without
the author created many types of moods in this
people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them
in school there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition and it will take forever to write
computers take away their time that could be used towards getting a college education why waste them
some people think computers are an improvements to society
i like her appearance very much
being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out
another problem is lack of exercise
dear i computers is a new technology that keeps on getting better and better
in my opinion the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them
it was about the civil war
usually a hobby depends upon a person’s interest
the geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her in her new home
so in reality some things should be kept and others taken away
many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences
dear man would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing

he is a which means he managed portfolios
what if a young child was wondering around a store or a library and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it

when the children are on the computer they do not want to leave
when the cyclist first set off he was doing fine he had plenty of water
we can communicate with others using computers
they go to school for hours then go to basketball or football practice sometimes we just need a break
there are plenty of reasons someone want to do this
the area the author goes through has an effect
so i believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions
we as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday
technology such as computers are very big
in fact out of people have been scammed some time in their life i can clearly remember when someone
dear whom concern local newspaper

they gives us inspiration and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them
the bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist
with these things a person can do research or use for entertainment
i want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem

this contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author

a library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes
this means that you have to practice more to get better in typing
also your planing a vacation the internet can help
computers take time away from spending time outside or exercising
dear newspaper have you ever stopped to think what modern day technology brought us

of money donated to an organization that assists in global disasters comes from online
this way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter
the camel he was in was affecting his brain and he just wanted to get it over with
computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than
i say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing
questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years and there is no simple solution
if you live in a city with not a lot of nature in it you can see what its like outside it with the computer
with censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people
with that thought in mind do we honestly think that censorship of libraries is a smart idea
on the other hand material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves
one mood in the memoir was peaceful
for my second opinion that people should not get off of computers because it they ever leave somewhere far they are not to be able to contact you
i believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored
also all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake the rough road
also trees that gives us oxygen too
there is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone
dear local i hear you are not sure if computers are good or not well they are and i have many reasons why but i will tell you is
you can do almost anything
i support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people
these websites can get a person to be willing to be on computer instead of exercising and staying healthy
also it says that they came selflessly as many immigrants do to give there children a better life
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
finally computers give people the ability to talk to other people online
they will be worth your wild
the budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower
in the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive all books will eventually be eliminated
we get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that had found
you searched everywhere by everything that the book would possibly be listed under
throughout this there is a very happy and loving vibe
my dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him
images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation
first as the army keeps losing more and more soldiers in combat and they try to recruit people they can post their ad up over the internet
but we need to know whats happening all over the world
the features in the story changed the speakers mood throughout his journey
i think maybe that is one reason i am not religious
if they are conflicted by a movie they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf
there are all kinds of computers but they all do the same thing
computers in schools help to increase the amount learning our children
if you do not want to hear those words or see certain images you should not have gotten that book
never will one book bind the world
that is why computers have a negative affect on people when their face is glued to a computer
some people think that a man who has many sons and daughters is a lucky person
another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance
my third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people
what are you going to do with the thousands of books that you can no longer read because it is offensive
are we going to take those books out to
all you need to do is type it in on google
the media is a way for some people to get out and reach others
overall our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music
i shall take a personal interest in the future of my students
removing offensive books magazines music and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints
libraries should not censor the materials they display
then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family
so why put them out in a bad way
computers are vital to us because they help our reflexes
i know nobody would want that for sure
my friends moms changed because she got a computer
people are wrong when they say it takes their time away from exercising
i hope you take my letter and into consideration
reading information like this creates a move advanced society
she uses this plant as a tool for comfort to help her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher
i think they have rights to hear it if they want and there parents have rights enough to let them
people just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter
he cant say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none
finally you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to
a walk in a big park or on the bank of a stream is even more refreshing
censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading
he is doubtful that he will make is journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy
parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so
have we grown lazy to do such a thing as to get up and look through a book
one example is my cousin
you could also play outside and shoot hoops or ride your bike
these books in my opinion can only help them
some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it
it is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them
first of all if you have a computer you meet new people
this section are for the younger children
then neither party is happy because both of their books are gone
at the first town he noticed a water pump but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid
censorship in libraries i believe that there should be censorship in libraries
so please read this carefully and i hope what i have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things
also magazines like or are now showing stories of drugs use teen pregnancy or death of famous
books magazines news papers and music are a great passing time
they make his journey seem hopeless
i do not believe that books should be censored
only because they are not the only people on the planet
one girl sits by her computer doing homework
most importantly i would like to tell you a story
the land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake
how do you think people can shoot a gun so and so quickly or how do you think a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time
the internet can quickly and directly answer your questions
exercise is so important now a days and people do not get enough of it
the sweet memories of this period are glorious
i believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph
these things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer
would they just be able to take it off the shelf
the person could go out and see friends and family
many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist
computers are killing us as a nation
many people read books about the real life books that they can relate to
this caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather directions he was given and lack of water
we throw away a moving song because of its lyrics
also as the terrain became hillier his journey became even harder
profanity nudity and crude humor as well as many other things are all over the media including books
life is full of risks so let them know that way when the time comes their ready
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
in recent years studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active
there are three reasons why they should have censorship
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful joyful and loving
also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke
because libraries are public they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves
also documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process
i quickly realized the computer is a tool used only when necessary
seeing the geese and winter hibiscus
a computer is to talk to someone without physically being there
in less than blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs
the first time he mentions the setting he states he is in a ghost town two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down
weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
if parents do not want their child to read something then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book
because computers have way more storage for more information
if my ambition is fulfilled i shall do my best as a teacher
although tolstoy was born an aristocrat he disliked the snobbish behavior of the aristocratic society
your parents will be with you can possibly be in to the light company
if we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site there would be none left for us to watch
the first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers
any type of content is art art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist
please just listen to what i have to say
but the people that work on computers all day is a different thing
the peacock lives in jungles in small flocks
it always has some kind of value
lastly computers let you meet new people online
do not take thing off the shelve just because a couple of students can read or watch it
once he passed a couple of troubling sights because they were abandoned and no one was around he began to worry
she bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her
i think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them then they are old enough for it
after that website you could go out and get the you will need
first off computers can bring people together
in conclusion i believe this material should not be taken off the shelves
it was easy to find out how life was in thanks to the actual girl explaining it
if a parrot is reared in a house no outsiders could get in without being noticed
exercising helps you grow
did you know you should have a minimum of min in sunlight each day
if libraries censored every book that might offend someone else then there would not be any books left for anyone to read
no a child should probably not in my opinion be reading about adult things such as sex
he makes his lessons interesting
this would be more on opinion based writing
those movies are watched by people of all ages
they have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics covers styles and plots
like trees they take in and release oxygen
it also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
but now you can find anything almost anywhere
did you know that of people the age of have jobs on the internet
so people out there get off your computer
a social life is very important to a grater
i hope that i convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people
as far as i know taking any form of media book or entertainment away from the general public would be illegal
from personal experience i can back this statement up with books i have read going through my school career
both of those things do on a computer because otherwise odds are you with of then
our four fathers more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the of the
in my opinion i believe that if the only purpose of it is to read it then it should be in a library
i think you should have to have permission from a parent or guardian if the material is explicit
finally should we do this it will not solve anything
after one hill the cyclist sees a building
with the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man
make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong
they say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention
it brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent
she said that just looking at the screen and she wanted to go helped a lot
everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing
if not nobody would buy the products
all movies books music and other materials are labeled as they should be
dear whomever it concern name is and i think that the effects that computers have on people is not good
in the word choice of that test again depicts her new attitude
this can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading
our views be different but we have similar needs
years ago i look a trip to for the first time
every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not
computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims
in front of a all does not support you with the natural urge to exercise
you can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth
i mean it was something very new to me almost like an adventure
they can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored
when the terrain changes he is a little discouraged
you wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer
every now and then you come across a book that changes your life
she vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew herself and get back on track
from my personal experience i have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books
your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward
that is how the sets the tone for this story
he comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid
if i miss something on it is almost definitely going to be on the computer
almost everybody was looking out and watching rain every now and then
the one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication
now but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it then our freedom is taken away
some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults
the computers bring people together
trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
so come on down to the council on and vote for the new of the
computers provide an excellent variety education in our society
there is more then in this story but the most import i think is loving
making purchases is fun though
which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united
second i would like to talk about some of the books libraries have
i think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if you want to change them or not
many young people change words in books but the books will always still have what really happened
computers can but promote bad habits
the first girl asked
according to a study done by the the largest cause obesity is actually computers
computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or
the desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist
one of my favorite is and it was about character from the past and get back together and do one more mission
i am also aware that people just be worried about their children watching movies listening to songs or reading books that are not appropriate for them
computers can be used as a learning tool allows communication with distant family and friends
why would anyone want to put this kind of material in there masterpiece
furthermore computers are making people lazier
he had once read that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate
know you know that i think that computers need to be seen less throughout the human day
children should read books that meet their age group
without this coordination people would not survive
you might even find a lady bug
you can just calm down and relax
are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun
there are some material in libraries i think should be censored to a certain degree
more people get offended by lesser things now
my parents always kept their arms their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us
in fact i have never seen a child in the adult section of a library
how times do you use the computer in one day
another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down
the growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others
he cuts and shapes stones for many purposes
they have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games
i think that books music movies magazines and etc
if we did not have computers we would not learn the same
thank you for your time to read this i hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more
censorship is a topic that it strongly opinionated
there is no perfect society
everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore they should all be able to listen to whatever
some of these effects include developing skills to help people for present or future getting a better education and helping people to become more social
the author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test
soon the moon was shining brightly
the setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist
the authors choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to
you can never remake rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator
if other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves
different people have different ambitions
dear local newspaper is my belief that people are spending too much time on computers
but a material should not be removed from a library shelve unless the or the manager find it offensive then i can understand their decision
i love all of his books but these ones are the best
kids try to learn people talk like websites things that they are not able to and over they can see are on
he also mentions how grateful he was to have a caring and loving family to be brought up in
the cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination
it will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information
there are lots of different kinds of books if the books you are reading offend you look for a different type of book
make us feel like we have to go out and try it
on the other hand those books be needed
this can lead to ruined relationships loss of friends and the chance of losing your love with family
not two miles into this section of the ride i noticed the terrain changing
the hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
the time has come to decide
imagine you doing a report on life in
that was my three opinion on which why computers are good effect on the society and i think that computers are really good effect on the society
if movies books magazines and music continue to be left uncensored the world will become a giant brouhaha
why make the company lose investment over something that could be easily taken care of simply taking it back where you got it from
if you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home
in additional people think it keeps them busy
they should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better
because who needs to go outside when you could be chatting with a friend or just being on looking up new technology
well lets get started
what makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure
had made us a better world
second example is students and their homework
and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run
this is what majority of the people in our society rely on
making friends online is the unsafe thing to do on a computer
many libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves
within a desert water is to be found nowhere
computers are fun education and a communication wonder
to begin the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level
the movie industry for example
any question you can be asked on the internet and you will get an answer
computers encourage kids not to study or do homework
email allows you to do the same as text but you can write longer messages
so i hope you take this in consideration that computer are great society
if the person who is reading book or viewing movies that be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it
i think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries
there are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library
lastly have you ever wanted to learn about a place faraway from you live or have you ever researched a topic for school
therefore it was not removed
i remember when i was in middle school i really wanted to read novels that i saw at the library
there can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation
in children spent of their day in front of a computer and outside
specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad
when your on the computer you can look up some of the natural disasters
people bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it
kids can get on the and stumble across things that they definitely should not see so does that mean we should ban the
i think i agree that computers affect people
when i was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library
it can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life
first we can learn about the places we want to go to
should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive
another positive effect that computers have on people is communication
you can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell without raising you phone bill from calling the brokers
it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope
songs made today can get a little out of hand
what ever happened to spending time with family and friends
which we all know we need to play sports
although technology is progressing computers are only the basics
pleases near my reasons and give me a fighting chance
if you were an author would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone
next i believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting are children watch every and anything they want too
even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library they can filter what a child looks at and reads about
many magazines and books such as and books about modeling portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body
in the memoir the author also tells about his extreme thankfulness towards his parents
had the town been thriving he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish
next the heat affected the cyclist
so that just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending
there is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say
my dog guards the house like a watchman
if censorship were to be enacted a library could not provide new information if someone else did not like what was being taught
was i ever under the influence
people are having less and less human interactions as computers become more popular
they make pongal rice by cooking rice with milk and jaggery on this day
at first in the cyclists own words things began well enough
he is explaining his past
kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them
different regions utilize different systems but that of the or the for the compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe
where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted
for people of all ages to obtain
her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe
they could afford nothing else
my first reason i mentioned before was it would give us intelligence
but after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it
there is one goalkeeper two fullbacks three half backs and five forwards
computers keep kids and teens entertained
and adults wanting to avoid an awkward conversation make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth
he follows the principles of truth nonviolence and courtesy
for some people taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms
people listen to music all the time
several people would agree but i disagree
it could be the elderly all the way down to toddlers
the author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph
it is important to know the pros and cons of computers
what some people think is the most innocent book could offend another individual
by meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust
in the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles
sometimes people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it
what about the adults
you sit and waste money especially with our economy the way it is
he could suffer from heat exhaustion
when you write a paper do you want to have to write it once then go back and write it more times
he gives a in depth and warm description of his life in and the relationships he made
what one person find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable
exercising is much more better than being on a computer and i say that to say this
books that are found offensive are more interesting than just plain boring books
and if i can do it so can they
my friend bought a computer game last week
so the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up
the sign is all bright and flashy so you stop to read it
after they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process
as continues through the passage it says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help
the mood was also very calm and very relaxing for the story
next reasons i can do my homework on i can write a big letter on i can do a lot of work in the computer is and easy
their perseverance setgoals to be achieved and a thorough knowledge about the world made their dreams come true
i agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers as well as most things in the world we live in
the trip was very different from what he had expected
that is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body
you can keep up with family members and old friends
punctuality means doing something at the fixed or appointed time
some people want all censorship items out of public areas
in of course we have the freedom to do what we want
parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at and pay attention to them
so editors writers and readers
one time when i was a young lad i checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about
children specially the younger ones like her very much
everyone should be interacting with someone
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
taking away movies and books is to not allow people to learn from their past
next is talk about being born in a simple house and that way mood there to
don’t hurt your dear ones even in your disturbed moments
in my opinion when friends get to excited online they decide to start rumors about other people and it ends up being sent to almost everybody
i believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing
the story ends with that line because draws strength from the hibiscus so next time she will not fail the test
there will be some interesting things you will find like different kinds of bugs and of insects
the library staff could put those books in the alternative section
most people would say that meeting people is good because you can have fun talking and getting to know people
in summary the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting
computers are best all around helpful
for example there is a magazines full of negative words and full of horrid stuff
movies can teach a lot about different countries and books do a wonderful job as well
my dream is to become a pilot
the cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination
its all a matter of opinion
a big question i ask is why
until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight
blessed are those who have good neighbors
how will we handle a major natural disaster
to begin with i feel everyone should admire the libraries
if you are sending someone a list a recipe for example
plus people need family
every since people are young they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style
to get rice the farmers have to hull the paddy seeds
could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students
you can become obese
sites like and can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person just to talk
i believe that this new technology is effecting our daily exercising playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family
they write it because it shows emotions and feelings
it should be left up to a person to decided what the see or view
in addition computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people states countries and etc
maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop
movies books magazines and music can be offensive
having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library
materials should never be denied from the library
search engines such as and more allows us to research anything we want to know at just the click of the button
children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines books and movies
quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures you race down the hallway to a different section
when she came home however seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination
in my opinion everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read watch or even listen to
therefore i urge you to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time to make it known to everyone in the city
children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to
the people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others
is on page paragraph
hopping off the computer and instead getting exercise would make for a healthier and more fit country
they have to depend upon themselves
the story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him
overall i think that censorship should be allowed at high schools
in paragraph it says how the teachings have stuck with him his whole life and how import family and his friends were to him which creates a warm setting
the mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood
he explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town
during his journey a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the
the lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible
these are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers
people take umbrage to certain words and consequently some libraries will remove the book featuring said words from their shelves
not only does it show in his style but the author also gives details that really create the vibe
if you are religious you should have the right to be able to read what you want
there is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone
lots of people find many pleasures to watching offensive things
in the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water
she soon realizes that she is home for things have come familiar to her such as the v formation of the geese
our beds houses televisions and even chairs are all forms of technology
farmers became slaves became very rich and i kid even grad collage at age
africa was ruled by the white people
i treat people the way i want to be treated and that should go for everyone
recently there been a debate going on between experts about computers
cursing to some people brings a book to a realistic point
all of those are the reasons why i think the computer has good effects
a very dark future waits for us if censorship continues
my friends wanted me to stop listening to her music
there are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day
there are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist
explicit material is available everywhere you look
computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles
when she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus her mother says that it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here
it was a beautiful place
everything in the library might not offend some people
less and less people are to enjoy a fresh and instead spend it indoors on their country
they be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that
i know i cant speak for everyone when i say that books magazines etc
their sole purpose is to induce the buyer to spend more
she failed the test the first time but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again
with magazines and music it depends on the subject matter of those as well
we checked into a hotel and had our lunch
when going to a library you expect to see various books movies music magazines and maybe other items
people however just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth no matter how bad it is
this adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family
some people that go online to research stuff are probable being lied to maybe someones just messing with them
what if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more
most news is about things that are bad rarely any good news comes around
many things can affect a cyclist
the lights in our houses glow with the help of electricity
dear i believe that computers benefit society very much
then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up
he is very intelligent
when your were a kid did your parents let you play all day on the computer
these words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes
they can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look
however he shows great determination and control
i believe that everyone should be free to read listen or watch what they choose to
the computer is not evil quite the opposite
people need to interact with other people and the internet is a fantastic place to do that
they agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer
i have only one answer
a perfect example of those items are historical documentaries or historical books they have no other way to get the information needed across to the reader or viewer
the second reason why i support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online
well you email or of course
so keep the books on the shelves
he sleeps for a few hours
or even if your job involves doing research
another reason why i believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books we would never learn from terrible mistakes
i know there are materials that are offensive to people
in conclusion the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
computers are a lot easier to help us with school work than textbooks are
i hope that my reasoning helps you understand my point of view
some are impatient and look at their watches at every other second other are worried and fret
in about two seconds you should have fantastic results
he shows that in growing up in such a wonderful family and home that he felt that the experience he had in his home was just exceptional
or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous
also they wont be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone
the more that becomes unknown the more we have to fear
studies show that over of children use computers for some sort of school work
you will have no worries then
we can talk on the mobile phone at a distance of thousands of kilometers
i agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things from all libraries
the features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways
do you know what happened
and hours of playing online games i realized i have wasted a lot of time
to conclude i think that computers have lots of effects on people
the cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination
how cool is seeing your friend when your not together
a solution a new wonderful machine called
in conclusion computers are hurting our society clearly they are unhealthy for our bodies
therefore computers are very positive since of use them now positively why stop
and i will know about computers and man what to do
well keep reading to find out
he would do this day after day
we should not buy eatables from such street hawkers
therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself
well with the computer you can now see people
the cyclists message is to follow a map something you know is right not a person that be lying or irresponsible
if there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library
you can email or chat to your friends online and see what pages to read and get there phone numbers back
it has made our society different in many ways
she concludes the story with the vow because it expresses her last bit of hope
he explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him
you will get used to talking to people and when you get comfortable you will talk to them in real life
censorship in has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art
there is different reasons why there are certain books music magazines movies that offend people but it also has a significance
i have not found a movie or book in any library yet that i have found offensive
when the bell goes all the children go back to their classrooms
i myself when i am a parent are going to censor my children away from what i seem unfit for their age whatever it be
for example they could need information for a country like
that is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has
he escaped just in time to stop one of his kids from going to an illegal party
they can play hitting games shooting games and even board games
rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
the rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions
school libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content
and last get off the computer and go see your family and friends
but everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know
it helps with communicating with other people
getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with samples
also she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is not a real one and she also says its not like the kind we had before
people need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone
talking to family and friends without spending money
since people spend too much time on the computer the exercise less and less
soccer baseball basketball and lacrosse
the author talks about the love and respect everyone had for each other in that community
firstly computers can be used for research
while some works have offensive language they also have a deeper meaning
also when you look for a home decorator you just go on the computer and look up websites to see some of the work they have done
these machines help our world become an easier place to do
so now the question is up to you are computers good for people or not
i urge you to stop the advances in technology now before it is too late
i think soit would help our kids and young adults to read more educational books rather than magazines and comics
they just go with the flow
my grandfather told all the stories to me
the features of a setting can clearly affect people
computers are great for school
everyone is not the same
many adults are over weight because they sit at computers and work as play games all day
movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes
with the click of a mouse you can access the internet
parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching or rated movies
i believe that all sorts of books music and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library
i feel bad because i let something so little mess up my life
i was drawn to this hobby when i was just six years old
i think computers help people develop better social skills
as you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly
this tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion
that knowledge i had obtain then had helped me later on my
did you know of all use computers regularly
should society as a whole take away variety
is very grateful for how things turned out
if one person does not like a particular book or magazine they should search somewhere else for what they want
i still get my exercise though because i go out and play basketball then play on my computer
i believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books
you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive
for example if the story would have taken place in he could have just stopped and bought water
the author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons
as time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious
i use crayons pencils colour pencils etc
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful
book that give knowledge to people in need not thing contain negative depictions of human life
in conclusion i believe that the children now a days that are exposed to any type of offensive things should know the meaning behind it
some people have even removed the from local library systems
so have an adult section and a kids section
those are some examples on how they create the mood
in this the author explains what it is to have a family and what it is and means
others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation
life is too short to sit around all day
for example when she broke down in the flower shop
internet websites can gives you pictures uploads almost every week
second we can learn about faraway places
also the author wants to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things
today i am going to convince you and society that computers are not as much as on issue as some people say they are
maybe this person could make a friend and one day meet them in real life
because not all people have the same interests
i think so and this is why i believe that computers are a more positive effect than a negative effect on people
then sooner or later more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book movie or magazine every other day
it would also cost a lot more money to call
people build their character through their reactions of how people treat them
second is your water supply
should be censored in some cases
i also think that many people have been complaining about the violence in the community due to several disturbing books music and so on
some books be offensive in religious ways
some people that this is and leads to but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information
i hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so every one can see how computers have a positive effect on people
i know you have fun with sports or nature but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly
he makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms
that could waste a lot of time
if its about adult relationships and the child takes it then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on
that is why computers have a negative effect on people
another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
this quote made me visualize the scene and i felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting
this proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out
on a computer you can just google what you need to find and read the article or map etc
some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence
is good and bad in a way is good because because your phone bill wont be that high up so you save minutes
all the teachers like him
reconnecting with loved ones loving nature and exercising are bad effects on society then what is good
having these documents in a public library could interest small children in reading things that are inappropriate for them
when the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride
the cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert
while he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water
but then looked up everything i needed to known in an half hour
the peacock can spread the tail like a huge fan
just say no to the computers and live your life the best way that you could
in conclusion libraries should have respect not only for people but for the materials they have
some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside
you can learn about faraway places and monuments
what i mean when i say homework is when you have to type up an easy or something
i think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created
this could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done you can use the
when a kid watches murder mysteries fantasy shows or dramas with bits of nudity it is different to them and they are curious
this means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation
though peoples opinions differ each opinion is equally important to that certain person
this creates more problems in schools and could possibly make someone hurt someone else or themselves
all i know is there too many to count adult websites that children from the ages of log on to everyday
so here is examples of these three things
we should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this
apart from his studies my brother is much interested in sports
they spend to much time on and and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising
in addition employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies
even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives that is the only important reason for a computer
many people not know is that every book is in the world for a reason
if i think that something is offensive then yes it should be removed from the bookshelves
if someone is making a project at a school
books should be the same way
so think are computers really harmful
she feels different and out of place but she is still strong
like some books music movies and magazines
if computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem
the author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist
so go ahead and expand your knowledge
dear newspaper editor of have and use computers everyday
in history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to to get away from their ruler
some parents might not want there kids to be exposed to this
although many people think that a certain book is appropriate others disagree
as it destroys the rants almost all the housewives love the cat
we need more good things to influence our children
one way is interacting with different people all over the world
the lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding
also i learned to type with type to learn
they should have a section just for that kind of music
parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else
the morning walk invigorates body system
more and more people get computers everyday
now i will talk about some of the things that computers help out with in life
do you think that books music magazines movies should be removed form a libraries shelf
also your computer might not be working all the time but your family and friends always will be there
when these two topics are analyzed it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer
recognizes this but also knows can never do enough to thank them
everyone grows up in a different lifestyle
i think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary
from reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end
total censorship is bad
another mood the set was being proud
first off i like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view
our government also realized the importance of trees
my point is that there is a whole world outside of we only got off our computers and played outside
this local market has made our lives very easy as all daytoday items are available at a comfortable distance
he was extremely proud and grateful to his parents to teach him all these
he begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him
moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me
dear newspaper i think a computer is not something bad for you
now they also have schooling tutors online
they have horoscopes and give advise
everyone has there own opinion about things so why should that effect what we are allowed to learn
i believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a stronger positive one
many features of the setting affect the cyclist
many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life
if ask an adult how ever they are most likely going to say yes
people these days though
they are time consuming but they count for a huge chunk of our grade
it says this when the characters says
well now you can in the comfort of your own home
libraries do you go to libraries
the author did a great job at creating those two moods and putting them into his memoir
they love to pain of others
overall censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it worth
next you can talk to friends all the way in another country without having to pay extra for a long distance call
when you limit the themes of books in your library some kids just pick up less and less books as time goes by
later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime
so instead i just jumped on my computer but not really jump on but any way so i went on the and guess what
imagine you writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday
the latest events are published in many languages
last but not least computers teach skills that can be applied later in life
third people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends
i do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive
with a computer you could do so many things
i hope i got my point across that they are bad
most teacher prefer the essay typed and not written
there were many features that affected the cyclist
people catch parrots at the young age
i stayed with him for long
since i am a teen i also know the problems with youths and computers
any parent would agree with that statement
first libraries are a good source of information
your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body besides the vital parts
also you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you in the moment
the features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt
even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial
also the terrain can affect biker
they type essays or while doing research on someone or something they could just save it and take notes on it later
the people who spent most of their time on the computer are the people who are addicted
she hopes when she is happy
some of the literature and other material you find in libraries however are not intended for certain people such as young children
if the movies are bought by the parents then there should be no problem there either
communities have many different types of people that live in them
the mood in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful
that is the mood that showed in his memoir of his family
this expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him
another is for books on certain people or events
without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily
being an author you have the freedom of speech you can write whatever you feel like writing
computers can help you to learn faraway places like and other faraway places
they help us with our vacation trips
it was a great occasion for socializing
then you buy it or sell it
why would you move from the shelves if they are going to know about it some how
i think that if there are books music movies or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive
his gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life
but its also making there life very in healthy
the title of the magazine was superstar
therefore libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf
this combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling and almost pushing him to death
this way you can make arrangements
there are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff
thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going
not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason
people are actually sharing their memories with each other all thanks for the computer
when looking at archetypes spring is time of new beginning and life
i hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today
in school there have been many times where kids got the chance to read case after case about people trying to get some of the best books banned
if materials are censored how can anyone learn
is content out that children should not see however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with
this shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much
you should always be thankful to you parents
because people with jobs most of the time have use or have computer
if we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library the eventually there will hardly any books for anybody
such things can also show anger hate and depression
there are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people
there is nothing but nude women in there
the hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants
this helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project you will be able to finish it on time
but the only types of people that those books movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids
in conclusion people are spending too much time on their computers and they need to stop
but i am here to argue the
almost every family has them
this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world
it has books on all subjects
the students in schools today are the future leaders of the world
the boatman came to my help
you question a leading doctor
a computer also helps me through my daily life
first of all computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
my point is that can happen to you let me change that to everyone in the world
second reason why computers provide a good education is computers help you do your homework
it lets people interact with people from very far off places
everyone is titled to their own opinions
a teacher works to build our nation
he also felt that you should always help people in need
the can not replace the real outdoors
more and more people are becoming obese
on you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians
when you go to a library you should be able to go their and get whatever genre that you want and their be no restrictions
this vocabulary change could be prevented if computer were not used as much
also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in
although there are people who think computers are good for you others could say different
if we took out certain books and music from the library it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library
students can be encouraged to do some kind of social work during holidays
say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it
since you are sitting not doing anything else you start to eat a lot of snacks
i know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball
also for adults they can take care of some finances and bills online and some taxes
lastly computer make things easier and have images on
without books people turned to electronics for entertainment
i know this from personal experience
it can cause many problems with others
i think that books music movies and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries
why should books or other such ideas but lets get back to the subject
computers can be used for all sorts of things
this shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water
the extreme heat of the summer definitely put a strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water
i believe that if something or someone offends you you have the right to take a stand
people go to a to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them
the books music movies magazines are not there to offend you in any type of way
people slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace
the mood the author set was warmth and happiness
most of the time people have to do essays
by her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change
many books that be found offensive are historical
i can understand that people have been through things and might not be happy that offensive materials are around
when a kids starts to hate his or her work
most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in there sport
they are utilizing their free speech by means of press
my first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer
well do you think that every book you read every movie you watch and all music you listen to is offensive
it shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it
some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies
the amount of time put into gaming
well my point is people use computer a lot because they are very helpful in many ways
first you can learn so much about nature online
my father had some urgent business at jaipur
dear i think that computers do not benefit society
dear local newspaper you can see about of our population over use the computer
we have no time to visit them
library censorship is a pointless act due to the information provided on the internet
he started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory
you never know what people need to hear
the features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut
you can help by teaching them what is right or wrong good or bad
i look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another
yeah there be a down fall to keeping offensive things in libraries
out of students have computers
even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject it is still good for our to learn about what happened
at the beginning of the story the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country and missed her home greatly
secondly the more time you spend cooped up inside the less time you get to enjoy nature
she had the memory of her grandmother and hibiscus
the mood of this story was very comfortable and very very loving
its all lost in some pile of papers
sometimes those books can get into the wrong hands and end up in the trash or burned
some can be a bad influence on younger kids
he takes the letters and other circulars from the principal to the teachers
therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship
everyone has different taste in movies music books etc
computers can do more harm than good
no matter the case with work a computer always helps
i have an opinion about this and it might not effect everyone in the world but i do hope so
as my teacher read us this book everyday we all sat and listened taciturnly
in conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story
in my opinion having computer is good to have
what my family believes not be what other families believe in
sat in the place of the boatman and had the joy of rowing for almost ten minutes
the game goes for adults that love jobs in offices schools or anywhere else
the same goes for one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems
i strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us
for example whenever i walk into public places i hardly every see children just running around especially in libraries
he feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family
clearly people get mad and upset when reading listening or watching these materials but this is what makes us who we are
thirdly students can learn about distant places
there should be a limit on the censorship
some of them are small some are big and some have fans on their head
find out about the culture first
typing can help majority with this
do people have the right to limit imagination
and yet he was determined to live
clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society
if the was never invented how would you talk to people from around the world
then my father left me in school
just simply pick up another book and read
my friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day
so there you can be on task and get ready early
try neighborhood activities
computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web
not quite an optimistic one is he
it helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone
this not fix the problem of people being offended but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive
he was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp
lastly the author creates a mood bravery and caring
in his memoir the details and the description just makes you want to keep reading and learn more about his life
i have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list
my first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project
with censorship there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read
which i mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club
this creates a loving and family mood
people say that computers are teaching important skills
life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment
with this process every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed while the ones that truly deserve it are removed
the government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society
this is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir
if there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it you are going to stop and read it
now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely but that is not how it works in many cases
are growing fast they are meant in be active and playful and without any active sport like dancing nor basketball they are going to grow big
the books that are found offensive should be removed because people get very upset if they find out that the book is talking bad about them
i think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them
if two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library
that is all i am asking for is for you to stand up and back me up in this war on censorship
he is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it
the way you want to live your life is up to you
everyone should have a computer in there home today
the big river looked like a snake
one’s profession cannot be considered as hisher leisure time activity
the author creates a special mood in this memoir
and also when your site seeing you usually want to find either the most amazing or romantic spot were you are
the terrain changes to short rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water
said a person interviewed
that way parents can know and control what their children are seeing
i believe that they should leave leave them on the shelves
the most important is the computer
he is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth
it depends on the person
anyone can check out a book at the library
one reason would be not get exercise going on the computer all day you will only get worse
is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers
you could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet
the author of the of and the of
if you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read
sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies
communication through the computer is very popular
what would appeal to one man might be the subject of ridicule to another
plus it can improve the way people feel about them books
on the other hand there are people that like to read this type of material
there are a lot of books that can be offensive to people in some ways
in this way we have done great loss to ourselves
she had a shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story
they spend their time watching pointless videos while they should be playing baseball or football
it was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times
say maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs alcohol or even sex
all he did was use that blasted electrical error call a computer
so people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do there best work online
when you do a story for the newspaper does it come out hand written
the use of computer per family has increased greatly in the past years
this would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is
remembers all the happy times he had and memories that took place in his home
can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers
also lastly it less your hand
computers are very helpful
he has a small shop where he works from morning till night
computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made
censorship only causes curiosity
he showed a real admiration for his childhood and the people he shared it with
this would make a parent cautious of where their child goes
way too people get away with way too many things in this day and age
second computers allow people to be able to learn about far away places and people
libraries or any place else
people will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to
another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is children
each site having at least different games
computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet
some say that offensive things should be censored
did you know that out of children today prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities
when you type you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys
computer save great tools for moving ahead and we should cheer as them not trash them
you can meet new people and is a good way to make life even better
however there are many different beliefs on this subject
in conclusion i must say once again that i support the advances of technology to an extent
computers also of for the average
i believe that computers for now are a good thing for our society
an eight grader can you believe that
dear local news paper i believe the computer has a positive effect on people
also if we can make something like computers imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements
it also has search engines that help you locate the information like or
have you ever imagined a without movies or music to entertain you
personally i think that there should be a variety in the library
another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family but thank to technology and computers i stay in contact with them
my next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family
they want to fit each magazine personally to each individual
libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge
some people go to a library to use the computer for a project or to check out books musical materials movies etc
later on that boy was caught and punished
my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer
have you ever been offended
goods spread all around
she would adapt just like the winter hibiscus
in the book of it says gave many people over to their sinful passions
this was one of the most popular places in the
in all i believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library
that is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library
they to not be bored
it could be a section that kids could not enter
milch cows have shown better yield of milk due to music i like michael jackson the most
that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again
its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself
the setting affected the cyclist a lot
when people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries
next point shows that people are not enjoying nature
the market place is very busy in the evening
it effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology
gives the reader a feeling of just how much loved his home
there is no way to approve a book to not be offensive because it is not offensive to every person who reads it
the decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media
however so the show will melt and her sorrow will go away
generally once a year
in conclusion there are many reasons why books should stay on the shelf even if they are offensive to someone
you could picture the house and smell the aromas
when people go on the computer they go on without worrying a little bit
instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early
music is a different story however
the mood created by the author in the memoir is
there is the fact that you can talk to theme
as you can see offensive materials should not be in libraries
i believe that the same should be done for books
i think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends
she reached for the book intrigued and flipped through the pages
the author of this memoir created a mood about family
also when he was talking about how thankful he was for what his parents sacrificed for him
so the computer can save us from failing
i believe that libraries should provide any kind of book magazine music and movies to the public despite if they are found offensive
if you have children what do you think they do most of their lives
reason is the give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
the includes free speech which insures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters
just as in basketball when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it
if mother has casual leave then she waits
computers have only become faster and
computers today are consuming our world
he takes his dinner and then sleeps
there was nowhere for him to find water for miles
some people think gay rights abortion and teenage sexual activity are offensive
think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with
i disagree i believe that it is bad for a few reasons
then it can give a better communication to others that lives farther away from you
they laugh play and cry like we do
when she knows the flower survived the harsh winter she will realize that she can survive living in
i strongly disagree i think that computers have a positive effect on people
well not everyone was able to come
its a completely different story now
all in all material in libraries can be offensive to some people
i personally love books about drugs sex and many other inappropriate things
if we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read
someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far
despite such discomfort this information should not be hidden from anyone
he discovered the law of gravitation
in the desert his water tasted like the flavor of battery acid
some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color
nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose
when people are on the computer they are not on for very long
children are getting bad ideas from books movies magazines and music
those are only my main reasons they are many more
but that is where the idea that these books were not created for them
my main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book
i believe that the books with violence which helps to convey and important point which should not be missed should be displayed by school libraries
not looking at a computer screen
that is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world
i understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries but their are some cons
a few minutes passed
all they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up show that
because hes talking about how his family started and how met his friends
lastly you can just plain talk
the mood the author used in the memoir is showing how proud their family is
as i said before people should spend less time on computer
lastly if students have project or homework that they need information on the computer could always help
men do you want to know the solders part of this war
to conclude the author creates a loving mood
he keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on
that basically means every kind of book out there
are there some relatives you been face to face with its because of computers
be a parent or responsible child if you are against censorship
computers cost a lot of many but it is worth it
for example year old used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer
i myself have friend who lives in that i miss very much
i can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy and i noticed not one negative thing was said during the story
most magazines music books and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you think
for example if you are playing games on the computer for hours it can strain your eyes
last customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make
it needs to be fixed
is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer
the biggest one is typing
making friends or keeping up with the ones you have in a positive way help fight depression
also some of the information might not even be true
that they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news
my first reason is natural disasters
some are small and some are big
but to avoid confusion we all divide responsibilities
when i overheard a little of their conversation i could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary
using a computer can help people in many ways
the library provides information for teachers students researchers writers and for readers who do it as a hobby
he gets joy in floating paper boats
if you ban books then you will ruin the future
libraries are used by many people people go there to research study and even just to find an interesting book to read
the way her gentle grandmother
some people like country and some people like alternative
when plants bud they are born
and i know other people like to do that too
the arrangement of their food is made by the warden
and basketball keeps you quick and always running
also computers have a positive effect and are beneficial to society because they help you communicate with friends and family all over the world
you should keep reading essay because i am going to tell you good reasons why i benefit people using computers
what do you go to the library for
are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured
each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not so to censor books be to censor all individual mentality
spending to much time on it
not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows
rapping it all up electronics should keep advancing
however you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people
dear there has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society
computers have gone from the size of a room to twelve inch flat screen monitors
fortunately it means we do projects reports and research on the computer
friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby
i believe it has a big affect
people who use computers do not spend too much time on them we need them to live a good life
removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library
getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it
but there are so many people who love to see technology advance that they want movies to change
the mood the author portrays is love and unity
without a doubt this world is gorgeous and is worth while to see the nature
we know their were many hills because in the text it says
a recent article found on showed that online chat programs helped people communicate with each other
your friends be offended by your favorite movie or show
for the ones who do accept it you can tell they are open minded
that is why some material should not be taken away
the can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know
we should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves
cultural books or magazines from other countries or of a certain topic can sometimes be very graphic and have language that is only appropriate for certain ages
books all have those things to someone some where
they use their trunk to drink water and pick up food
dear i think computers have a good effect on people and not a bad effect
genre comes in all kind of different types
most of all it can cause fights which later on can turn into war
the tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation
taking a book away from a library shelf can decrease of knowledge from someone that might need that information
this is good because instead of calling people you can go on computer and talk to them for free
the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story
just like me most of my life i lived an apartment and saw it as any other home because of the parents you have there that care for you
many parents watch their children go through this and are sometimes helpless to stop it
this quote shows that is thankful for a nice place to call his home
so next time you go to the library to research a book stay at home do the same online
the music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in
that is how it goes with movies books music and magazines
some say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children but i say that this is not so
with all that has been said do you still believe in all of the going on in your nearby library
i mean come on how many college students do you see without a laptop
but is it their decision to say that some things offend people
its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you
if they do not want to buy or check these materials out then then they should just go to another shelf or shop at another store
students use the for many reasons
a study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend
the computer lets me see nature talk to friends and family and lets me see things like videos that twill never ever see in books
go see what you can find
people should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time
i can type a that big in about minutes because it have been typing in other
libraries are considering removing books music movies magazines etc
i should i tried it before
i believe that offensive books music movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries
then as easily as rounding a bend my troubles thirst and fear were all behind me
yes there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this
there are words spoken that will offend many
hard truth of responsible people turning into betrayers is depicted quite efficiently in this movie
i kid you not after hearing about sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless
these problems are slowly spreading and we must come together to abolish them
the computer be fun but its always important to get outside and enjoy nature
you can also conduct research on the web you with many projects
another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet
these free websites let you add friends send messages and post pictures
i believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with
i remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from are local library
this showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat
the sight and felt he walking not make fall on the
in the evening he returns home
i had gotten a on this project
so reader these are some reasons why people should easily computers
he builds castles of sand and feels very happy
this also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be
in that book it describes kidnapping and the rape of young girls
the sad thing is i did not know it before i did it
some such as playing sports
some feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having
any one can use them and learn new things at the same time
you could send an email and save the paper
are you hearing this from your children than usual
if they did not like the book or movie it is their fault for picking it in the first place
we have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out
they use them to much these for people can stop going to gyms and get over weight
a production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them
soon the drizzle turned into heavy rain
this prevented her from focusing on the test
a good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them
kids are told many times a week by their parents teachers and other adults to go the library
i feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now
also the mood seems to be very thankful
think yourself calling your best friend who lives in
when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself
but there also can be things that you do want them to read
some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else
the internet can show us pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before
so they will choose to maybe find offensive materials
they think people spend to much time on the computer and are getting less exercise
the same goes for music movies and magazines
if there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food
i believe in freedom of thinking because it is the most valuable resource that we have it is what sets us apart from each other
is a huge thing to worry about kids all over are on their computer than outside
everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library
in conclusion things such as books and magazines are allowed to take from the shelves
but most importantly you can learn so much
computers offer many learning opportunities
one simple way to prevent this is spending less time in the computer
it relaxes you pumps you up it is used for parties events and so many other things
one offensive to a person not be offensive to another
i can remember when i started typing my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them
in reading these books i see that there is no glamour in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law
technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world
so make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others
it could have language racial slurs or anything else one might find offensive
yes the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air
he said using the internet also saves more time
as i see it no one is forcing them to read it
sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it
some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message
people are not always as they say they are
first the mood is very
this is why i support the computer
this shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking
as citizens of the we can not let this happen to our great nation
does this mean that i think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries
the constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character
the light coming on to your eyes is like staring at the sun but not quit as damaging
that is what i truly think the mood of the story is
soon the time is over
computers have helped advance medicine as well
reading is an extremely popular activity
how can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things
libraries need to take control of this issue the right way
the author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents
i think society is too much time in computers
so to boost her confidence she decides to plant it
in conclusion the reasons i feel this why are because people need to exercise more and interact with family and friends
however computers help in more than just writing papers
reason why i am concerned that people using the computer a lot
its not the computers fault
these experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature and interact with family and friends more
my three arguments are they help your typing skill educational
everyone has the right to read any book they want to
the mood is set to a sad feeling
its the same thing with the other things like the magazines books and music
it is a new day and age things have changed from what they once were
also the mood is caring
this is why to continue forward with computers and technology for the future
it is only offensive when we make it offensive
which person has the benefit in situation
it will pound and feel as if its on fire
another is that it lets people stay in touch with family and friends around the globe
last that is why in this lifetime you need computers
these dangerous computer have people on it called online predators
obesity is a huge problem among the children in
people are becoming the environment and losing important life skills
you could even read a book too
i believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the and other people around the world
with your friends you ran go to the movies have a sleepover play outside
when you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book
india was also ruled by the white people at that time
the geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day
the reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also
should books that be offensive to others no because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more
if you need directions or help finding a phone number a computer can help in multiple ways
her parents came selflessly as some immigrants will do to give their children a better life
this is because of less exercise less time to enjoy nature and interacting with family and friends
picture for yourself you as a year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history
i agree with the newspaper people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising
the novel to a is a great way for people to understand the history of the
because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand
enjoying nature is another option
because after all what you think is offensive be the best thing in the world to someone else
and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves but not everything
i think that when it becomes a threat to the they should remove material
do you know anyone in the world that can say the computer is not fun
it shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much
books magazines movies and music are created with a huge diversity
the routine of the farmer is never disturbed by the sun or rain cold or heat
this is unfair for any student because this novel is inspiring and life changing so they are definitely missing out
the setting was effecting his mood
so he ends up running out of water
but not just showing kids around like they use to
now some people might say that you can read a book on that country but not everyone has time to sit and read a book
it was really wonderful
these have been some moods in this story
at first people would think it was a terrible world
the last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination
thanks to them you can always stay caught up with the latest episodes of your favorite show
why take it off the shelf
dear i am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society
these people get not enough exercises which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well
so the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope
most of it had to do with how grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int
the censorship that i am discussing is specifically about censorship in libraries
he even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others
also the learn important facts about places and people
human beings do not always want to learn the same things
to finish this letter i want to say that computers allow people to learn
also instead of removing the materials completely why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive
with computers you can search all the latest stories and find things cut when you want to know them
before my school closes for christmas vacations i give gifts and cards to my friends and teachers
do you still support these computers
the man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves
they also have web sites you could go on just to play them
these books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing
having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves
she wont give up but try again later on in the year
also the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do
the most well know is the computer
this can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it
we also have a pair of lungs which help us to breathe
but if your newspaper were written out by hand then that would take a lot of time people paper money
some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant
from my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline
this is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another
dear local newspaper name is and i am a citizen
therefore many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books movies magazines and music
so why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing drugs and drinking
censorship violates freedom of being different
let these books serve their purpose
computers are an amazing technology to life
new things can be learned from them
technology has helped many people and still continues to
i believe that almost of kid are on the computer because they have nothing to or it is addicting
some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views opinions and morals
also while she is planting the plant she sees the geese with a new familiarity
and that just brought him happiness
people use them to talk to friends and family online
dear you all know many people in our town have been quarreling about computers
movies are a big concern
firstly computers hinder interpersonal connections
i believe it should be taken off and there are alternatives to this
teachers especially at the elementary level must be very creative with their teaching styles
i think the computer is a great of learning
i hung my head means that he was depressed
therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject
please take them into consideration
or if you have ever wanted to drive a stock car you could play a game online
today computers are helping the world in many ways
but we just cant get the nerve to do it
my opinion is that the computer help a lot is something like need in our life
the animals and the food they eat
there is just to name a few
they are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling
in this wasted time you could be out going for a jog or walking the day
if you have a bumpy ride then the cyclist will have a harder time
she also said in paragraph she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home
i paid nineteen dollars for it
chatting become something that almost of the uses
no matter what religion ethnicity or moral values you hold just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone
so read on to hear more
imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an a in that class
this is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration
if you get rid of movies from the library then people want be able to have a visual aid as there alternative way of learning
we should have milk every day
dear you know becoming reaching not only are computers are very helpful machines
another reason is because the road was very rough
secondly nature is a marvelous thing
libraries are a place that someone can go to to learn about something
you can avoid things you find offensive
first of all who decides what is offensive and who it offends
the best part is that is free
let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries
do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it
we need to write up and appreciate with the
all of these obstacles tying into another
after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit
the parents come to the country with such courage without any knowledge of the language or the culture leaving all there families and friends behind
finally there is a warmth that contributes heavily to the mood of the memoir
people go on every day uploading videos pictures blogs and just about what ever they want
so is it worth it to you
certainly text sources can give the same accurate information but the computer is fast and easy
in that case parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library
these amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation
in this case i strongly disagree with the critics and for my side of good uses
have them grow up the way they want to grow up
movies are something that people love to watch come on we pay to get onto see them sometimes
company designs software and uses computers
here the author is trying to stop for water but since no one lives in the town any more he gets none
so the computer actually helped with real life activities
dear newspaper my name is and i believe that computers have a negative influence on people
if you need information on anything you can search it
just imagine late at night pm no library no computer and a giant essay due tomorrow
also some books that are offensive shows students to not do the things they see in the book
we all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives and we need education
people can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school
with all these hours wasted in the virtual world people are lacking in exercise leading to many problems
is an example of keeping in town with someone else
in the short story rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist
if you keep it up now it not seem bad but hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes
if they are overweight their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge
but also give what point of view i feel about the books that are on these shelves
there are lots of stuff in book that people think is offensive
there is a warmth kind of family mood in this memoir
i disagree that most books are offensive to readers i believe that they just help the writers get their points across
she is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future
the flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration
the narrator tried the test once and failed
i would strongly advise you consider my proposal because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public
so he had to work hard from his childhood
being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online
they have no knowledge of this part of life so what happens when they get in the real world and grow up
speeding the development of climate change
computers offer video games learning games and that bring creativity to
what is offensive to one person not be offensive to the next
there is a reason libraries have many sections
for now on i am going to think when i spend all mu time on the computer how it affect my life and my family friends
we as take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a
just because i or any one else finds them offensive
censoring and removal of these book are pointless for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue
dolphins love to eat fish
i love these because they are very amusing world
this however is something to take as a concern
if the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries then i think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read
a computer can tell you just about anything you need to know
computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework
this feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated
dear should certain books be removed because some people think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read
when i was six years old we a driving game
some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens even if it does claim to be age appropriate
when you are sitting at home with a ton of think again the computer is there for you
then when i was older i would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos
the main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water
one reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels
to conclude the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives
you can get payed for the work you do with websites and
for example she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland
information processing is about computer
everyone is different
the cyclist then began puzzled and distraught
we need to do things on our own more often and stop relying on computers to do everything for us
as a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary
i eat my snack with my friends and play games with them
books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new world for readers
younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room
it benefits society and i enjoy every bit of using it
it would be a would far different from our own
computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house
sure some types of media especially songs and movies just spill out nasty themes and foul language
kids who spend hours or emailing their peers spend less time with their families
as i sat at my empty lunch table approached me and asked to sit down
the same applies for magazines and movies
computer can have every game you want they have kid games year old sister goes on to the games that you can match
it is when you as a individual can act like a human being
truly this is a good thing to let people use
no matter what happens odds are is that children will find their way around these things it never fails
i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
that book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life
his parents had a room house but there were able to turn it into home
therefore i have determined to treat the poor people without any fee
this topic is just too abstract to be regulated
it is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf
they also use a lot of electricity
this is first reason
most modern day businesses are run by computers
it seemed as if they had used up all their abusive vocabulary and were about to come to blows
the sun gives us light and heat
you censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book
because i use them myself
good neighbors can help one another
instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family there is also video chat
it also has a very loving tone to it
not only do people interact bu people can research useful information
finally they are a major waste of money
there are so many types of genres of music that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music
with only a couple of people feeling offensive to some things but the majority find different that would ruin for everyone almost
with that in mind people will always see you on the computer and eventually get sick of you
what really makes something offensive
now people can pull out their or player and listen to music
the simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them
those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist
this is why computers are valuable to everyday life
secondly it can give a more realistic image of a person place thing or event
these things can keep people healthy active and in tiptop shape
instead of going to the library and reading through all these books to learn something you can just go online
this will effect their later years interviewing for things such as colleges or even jobs
in the short story rough road ahead the cyclist faced with many problems
if i was a person who got offensive by something that was on the shelf at the library i would pass it up and not pay attention to it
computers teach us many things
in conclusion having a family computer is a very good thing
in the memoir the author emphasized a very specific mood
computers teach us and sometimes can guide you
and you end up being successful
the way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the en time boot
books can be offensive to many people
once because a copossanger tried to relieve his sufferings by smoking
also things like and face book help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends
the setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the heat
allows you to talk to friends comment on their videos and subscribe to them plus it provides hours of entertainment without a fee
without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten
and hope they would do the same for you
thanks to the computer i got accurate information
the flower represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination
computers have all these websites that are full of great information
when people are going to lay on the for minutes it takes hours
she is in a new country and just failed her drivers test
is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity
i often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time
does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad
we need material of substance in our libraries for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world
think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer
it is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise
why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people
computers are great writing tools
who be the final judge as to what books be banned
snake do not sting they bite
or you can level up skills like wood cutting prayer farming fishing mining and cooking
the newspaper should also have a very strict code of ethics to which it should conscientiously adhere to
the third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment
even if they are miles away you can click a button and have a live video chat
however these books who many find offensive could also be beneficial to its readers
even though the setting was tough teasing and ironic the man made it through and still with a smile on his face
for example the internet has many websites that keep people in touch
well for one thing i know that computers can take up
many have it for entertainment purposes
this problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that on average spend and a half hours a day on the computer
many people in the read
because the found the work offensive the generations after can never read the books burned during
hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top
like in the beginning computers help us learn keep in contact with people and are our future
with how the human race is everyone is going to hear something bad or even see something
if it only offends a few people then i think the answer should be no
some enjoy things that others not
whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide
on a rainy day students will spend time on their computers
next computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people
so when it comes down to censorship in libraries or anywhere its just a bunch of opinions
it can and will mentally scar them for life
to some people the strong words help the reader get the point across their head
they give you access to an amazing amount of information
those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually
actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town
the heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive
for example there is
i was spending around hours online and getting on sleep
when a teacher asks me to type a paper i always do it on the computer
back to my experience with the books you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter
also it has many website like or that let you interact with friends
education just become a whole lot easier thanks to the internet
this variety provides stories for many audiences
the first solution is to have certain offensive material under lock and key from the public
this quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going
computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends
public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored this includes public libraries retail stores the internet and
scientists say that about of all have communicated with someone at least once through computers
some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind
in conclusion i believe that computers are positive for three main reasons
in the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road
our school library is having books which i like very much
and then there is the content of what you are viewing
there are meth labs all over for meth
i have seen many offensive books
the author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir
we pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors
overall computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind
but you can get emails and instant message ways
what they could be doing is enjoying life
the lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst
they left everything behind them
what we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways
you are able to talk to people from different countries
lastly to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me
most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet
he performs his duty in the city street railway platforms interstate bus stands and at other places
all we need is a little more organization
the author could not accept her new country as home yet
thank you for taking your time reading this and i hope you do agree with me
with him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat
some were discussing politics
i think that the book magazine or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive
most use this account to talk to their friends online
this is my last reason
the only way to cook would be with fire
they also provide learning experiences with many resources at your finger tips
computers are great but the can also have negative effects on us too
without computers people could not learn
the mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir
in the memoir the mood that was created by the was saying family is the most important thing in life
do you like computers
because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature
dear editors i was planning on taking a trip to
no books would be left if we censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book
lastly taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important
in this paragraph i will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist
it also means you can email that walk to a teacher or notes a friend who might have missed school that day
this is where computers come in
many kids even myself would rather be online than read a book or do homework
some movies even show people having sex
finally people use computers more
by just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side
the author concludes the story this ways for a few reasons
everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way
so finally i have a request
they do because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one pitcher that is in it
is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends
they would most likely to tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material
he brought his laptop with him so he was ask to video chat with his family
out of students enjoy nature every week
learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading but also the human race
removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge
people all over the world by laptops to travel to one place to another
kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this
children are more free to do what they want and say what they want making offensive a changed word
but luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water the features did affect the cyclist very much
i usually do that so i know when a good is to an in the to buy what i want
every person he asked told him is near but from dehydration it took him longer
that sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else
i believe that the effects a computer has on a person are good effects
if you say yes i would like to no why
this problem could easily be avoided if needed
i hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary
those are the moods that i think the author created during the memoir
i know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school
i do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life
for example a fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them
for example most local newspaper have a website that you can visit
also it is the best time to study and play
computers benefit society more than you would think
and what be offensive to me not be offensive to you
my mom also uses the computer to go on
that also shows how grateful the author is
the real question is what are we limiting
this is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place
thank you for your time
the fact that the author is running out of water makes continuing on a very stressful
they each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written
it is always neat and clean
just go on your computer and play some game or just find some activities you whole family could do
he eventually got to a bait shop
a study shows of families that go on vacations have strong relationships
our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved
computers also can be used for communication
computers are essential to our present day lives
i think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful and satisfied and that he is loved
we need to solve this issue before more make the switch from nature to computers
now you know that computers make life efficient
i can honestly tell you that i love computers
questions were only used to support my survey the next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer
do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended
some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes
if we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library
in conclusion computers are very handy
also you are pushing your loved ones away by being on
the people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get there way at least in their community
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
at least you getting up to get the phone
sure it might be pricey to
first computers need electricity to run
libraries are community centers
offensive material in libraries is directed to be read by young children
she vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flowers survival and her realization of important memories
for example say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting
the variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation
i think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive
now use computers to organize lesson plans and print out reminders for their students
they allow you to do so many different things
so think are you for or against censorship
why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday
in the quote the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing
people spend way to long on the computer
the last paragraph in winter hibiscus was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test
should books magazines or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves
the feeling of her old home in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable
for example i have younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids
this helps people stay connected
how could you go wrong
how do we get it out
i like to keep the teddy near me when i am at home
he told them this is a free country i can do what ever i like and whites liked that he spoke up for his self
people should get off their butts and go
and the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all
my mother made hot tomato soup for us
please heed my advice and use the internet and computer
using the computer can access quick information
lastly i think that the computer offers no physical gain this nation is in a severe heath crisis
i can tell you reason why
he has no worries no hardships and no troubles
five correct explains everything about his home that made him who he is today
they are owned by capitalist and have to toe their line
offensive books should not be anywhere you are at
this allows the reader to feel such love and happiness which is being expressed
setting depends on how you can go or move
does everyone think the same material is offensive
when he finally reaches a sign of civilization the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best
although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned it would be quite difficult to accomplish
go to the gym a vacation without a computer
or do you ever have time to go outside
criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art
and was unable to have a supporter to help
not only books but music or movies
if schools are allowed to continue censoring books then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored
a computer saves the report and shows you some mistakes to take case of your children
to concern i have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society
i think that censorship should be allowed in high school
but really if you think about it its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about
the cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive
some parents deem this inappropriate but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation
however many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet
people have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world
but i do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it
as with some parents they have their own rules
during this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him
the last most important reason why computers have a positive impact on people is because it allows people to communicate with each other
they were able to catch the man
another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town
our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world
under the to the every citizen has the freedom of speech press and religion
because or she finds it offensive
think twice about how close you sit from the computer
but some people say that it distracts you from exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friend
people would be more fit have closer bonds with their family and get better grades in school
most kids by the age of have already used a computer for over hour
at this point he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were
what if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive
everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries
the best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves
you can check sports scores from the night before or check sports score from years ago
one affect was the uneven bumpy roads he was trying to cycle on
my second reason is when people have nothing to do
were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity
kids to a certain age deserve to know whats going to happen in the real world when they grow up and start a life
the people start yelling because they did not find it offending
i personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit then being inside on the computer getting fat
so go outside and explore you will never know what you will find
because if you take out one you should take out all off them
this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions
doing this would grant the people who wish to see this type of material access to the material
using a computer and learning in school basically can teach you the same thing
last reason is it can help you be organize and get a job
for example lets say you went on the computer for an hour that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
for me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book
other people actually use their computers for things that they need
this problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites
even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers
i think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors
more and more people are using computers on a daily basis but i do not agree that this benefits our society
reading is what keeps us strong entertained and those who know the past are not likely to repeat it unless books are gone
many families have different values they want to pass on to their children morals they hope to teach them
these computers provide access to games helpful in training
no person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes
what does the word offensive really mean to a person
you can go online to purchase tickets
it started to drizzle
the author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things
there has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life
when all they have to do is do not get the book think that others might like it or remember they are there for the readers entertainment
they are wrong because the internet will hold that information for as long as it needs to
dear local newspaper in my opinion they take time away from exercising
also the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard which drains him or her of even more energy
would you be hurt and taken back
or how old it can get
most kids come home from school and go on aim
so as you can tell computers make a strong positive impact on society
nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games
people are concerned
i could not ride many of the rides there due to my size
and parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying
their is a problem for this idea what books should go into this section of the library
just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits your liking
these offensive materials are included in this right
well those are my thoughts on rather or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive
there were many people that were like family to him
however you not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library
so the cyclist was happy and strong
even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill
someone else might want to read it
those are the reasons i believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph
hostel life has many advantages
the sight was troubling
so when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place
it really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with
and it beats playing on the computer all the time
if the road is full of hills it takes a little more strength to maintain speed
in addition to limiting diet and exercise computers are also the source of yet another act
then put up posters at the school i go toto see if anyone else would be willing to help me
also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to
the computer or great way to find a job
i for one think computers benefit society today and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step
trying to control our lives as if it was your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises
on my desktop computer at home
dear people that read the news paper and that have that like to play the computer all day more
that is why i believe books should not be censored
say if there is a book discriminating a race than i agree that it should be taken off the shelves
in the field the player is not supposed to dispute the decion of the captain
there were long queues
but all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful
so what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed
people think during the winter there is nothing to do
when you are out of energy your ride is over
libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed
the author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it
camels are ruminants but camels do not chew their food very well before swallowing
for instance when your in gym class you want to be healthy
the terrain and hills made it difficult
i think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say
computers have helped children and adults learn increased the amount of jobs and computers have helped law enforcement as well
also should be socializing with friend
there is a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as there online
she wants her to know she is three for her
during the cyclists biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations
so and for letting me voice my opinion
my opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book
the quotation all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
televisions have almost replaced the radios and transistors
it is the way our culture is
more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
dear local newspaper on a beautiful sunny day people inside on their computers instead of enjoying the weather
you can learn about many new places with a
if they are gone cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten
the setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns and buildings as well as a bumpy terrain
libraries are full of all different sorts of books movies and magazines
in conclusion i believe that computers are helping us and is not a bad thing
my friend found disturbing to look at some pictures because showed blood
depriving them of actual history
the obesity rate has increased between then too
first of all i would like to talk about how computer can help us with anything
college students teachers and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books movies music and magazines
computers help people learn and make work easier its a fact
by doing so i believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones
this memoir sounds almost cozy in some ways
this really improves students grades because they had more resources and more information to choose from instead of only the information in the book
also this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration
to do assignments for a job or school
the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist
in conclusion computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light
people love them and use them all the time
that is bad that they would have that on there shelf just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to
i was happy with my choice as i checked it out
and you can pay your bills on the computer
schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers
people love to read gossip and learn about the latest trends
let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online
if something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it
is right to have censorship in libraries
the author shows sacrifice by showing what the parents had to give up in order for their child to have a better life
now more families only spend time with each other when they eat dinner together
we have a brain inside the head which controls all the other organs of the body
there is a wide array of music that people can enjoy
when it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf
typing is a big part of your life
he uses imagery and sensory language which helps us feel i homey atmosphere when we read
preventing a child from seeing a rated movie or reading a letter to is a separate issue from censorship
these were the moods the author expressed in the memoir
everybody should have their right to what ever it is that they read or like to watch
but jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed
how can you make fun of someone who does self harm
how will a rape ever be able to be prevented
this leads into eating unhealthy foods
there are a lot more good than bad things
people can also hack into your computer and look at all your documents
that is why i believe computers have a positive effect on people
not for any one thing in particular just gratitude
i do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly
the last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about love loyalty and friendship
younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting
however i would stop going to the library if that happened
the terrain has a great deal to do with it
in this memoir is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to to give him a better life
the computer makes work and studying fast and simple
sometimes there is even a snow the experience of being there
it also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family
she listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun she used to be
they could also find interesting things to see in that country
we can progress by doing hard work
in fact computers are so useful some schools are starting to notice
it purifies my blood
if someone were to write a book about my religion i would find it interesting
computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways
happy and grateful stand out as the two most important moods
websites can be a way to find computer time
sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are
the friends and relatives are missed the most
a child’s life is full of innocence
what the book stores libraries and movie stores should do is put an age limit on the books and movies
being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing
do it to learn it sit at a computer website to hire someone
however if you do supervise them while they are there
we could use energy for more important things that people any need
materials give us resources and we learn new things
everyone should be able to watch what ever they want with out it having to be censored
they get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in
this can also apply to movies magazines music and so on that are placed in that section
also the obstacles faced by the cyclist
i think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades
i can see why this bring up many conflicts as computers can be very helpful
i think you learn everything from your parent how to act and all that
freedom of speech freedom of ideas freedom of thought
when does homework got done
have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was
this story is about different cultures coming together as one
dear local newspaper you know that over half our nation own home computers
with out computers we would have to wait in longer lines for what we want to buy
this was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through the author ended it in a very interesting way
you can even make new friends to talk to
censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested
when my grandparents went to school they had no idea what a computer was
the smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills which made it harder for him to ride
it was useful and did not waste my time
i think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy
also the military keeps secrets on computers but if your smart enough you can hack it
along with the rating there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is
wants to be overweight and you can change that
i do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course
i think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions and using them in there daily lives
there is much to be learned in the way of psychology and human nature from almost any writing
kids use it to talk to friends play games do homework and to do many other things as well
since humankind has had writing we became more intelligent taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings
many people say over of the
many people use computers in their every day life
he has no consideration for others
high profile documents such as the constitution should be held in high security areas
every day they are on the computer
these novels were acceptable back then
terrorists can communicate by the internet
if it was me then i would say yes to allowing censored materials
do you think way too many people are on the computer
when you are walking around you you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked
i want to lead a good life
everyone likes different things and has different views
but people do not use water sparingly
no one wants to be that way
in case we get lost on the roads the computer can us get to out location
the cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat
what if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it
some stuff be more offensive than others to different people
he always speaks politely so that the patients feel comfortable
the second son is of my age and studies in a public school
the cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured
however i think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library
each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral
consequently movies books music and magazines with foul language does have an affect on our youth
the paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent
it also teaches you how to type fast
they are helpful and fun you never run out of options with a computer at your side
it is happy but slightly sad
the mood created by the author is one of loving mood
too bad only out of every could relate to kid message
dear local newspaper have you ever forgot the book you needed for homework
in we practice freedom of speech
computers are essential to our way of life
so now you now where i stand on the issue of computers
that is what the mood of this memoir was and in whom created it
my opinion on movies however are a little different
this made the trip extra hard and discouraging
so as a result i keep in contact with her through the computer
however the one thing that acts as an escape for them is their gardening
video games are also popular
that will be the kids will get fat and kids will never want to go out side they will want to play video games eat junk food
a second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research
opinions are alternated often about many different things being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often
so people should just spend a part of their day on the computer
one year i found out the my great grandmother died of cancer
the temptations to read violent and vulgar books should be overcome
safety is one the most important things in life
there is something offensive to people in every work that has been published and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something
i mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them
is this you want for your self and generations to come
we can also talk to our friends online
if you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures foods and more
my last argument is that people can talk to anyone using chat sites
i believe if people can find a balance between them people will agree more about computers
she took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time
by doing this he expects a better
there are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight
this is just another great use of computers
at a movie rental store you would expect to find movies that are adult but not in a public library
if we continue this most people will lose eye sight
the same way goes for a magazine also
there was pushing and pulling
he was grateful because of the sacrifice moving to the us his parents did for him
i remember when my sister was in grade she never took her eyes off the computer
if there is foul play they penalize it
everything is offensive to someone
there is a lot of offensive music too
with these in place there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public
on festivals like christmas mr david arranges for a gettogether for all the neighbors in the common park
when i was a child my mom spend hours in the local grocery shopping for food
lastly the buildings were what made him want to give up
this would not be possible if they censored all the material the offended somebody
it makes you think of your own family
now the needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary
have they not visited the place for months after months or even years
throughout his journey the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting
the driver of a car lost his balance at a turn
a sport or hanging out
now then my point is that even though to many a book be horrible but to others it be the best book in the world
he had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house
censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from
see a message so computers interesting with friends and family
advantages and disadvantages of examinations
do you have any better ideas
if i am late to come home it waits for me on the roadside
there were no buildings or people to the town anywhere
also it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material
in the student body in class of at high school most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year
dear local i think that computers are on positive effect on people
sight is most of the time your most important sense
many say that history repeats itself
states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of
very soon he anger goes with the wind and sprang up to her usual kindness
it has made our long distance friendship easier and closer
if books were censored literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same
computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done
another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again
now someone can come along and say if the book is a fantasy
the author uses this paragraph to conclude to show shes going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings
a library holds many books magazines movies etc
and also children can get very offended
without those things in our life i really can see this world falling apart
also expert say that children in the throughout the world learn more from the computer then from a textbook or hearing information from a teacher
in conclusion i think people should spend more time exercising hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers
books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them
some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another
there in my opinion needs to be a room with said materials that children have in no way access to
tumbleweeds crossed my path
prevents you from exercising seeing friends and family and cam impact lives in a bad way
he is enjoying every family moment
so you go to your computer from there
we should do thorough calculations and also we should do a thorough survey
his friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble which he tries
at this point the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable
fast food companies like contribute to obesity so do computers
is this the way you wish our world to be
music is also a controversial material to censor
during the whole memoir the author describes how much he honors his parents such as how they not only told him life lessons but also showed him
there should not be any banning of books
its lack of water dry air and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature
show or you can watch music videos
with what i believed was my last burst of energy i maneuvered down the hill
the is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts
so did you start to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun
the simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone
the computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies
then only we should decide to do something
sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book help the other person
also you can talk to them even if their in a different state
just keep the peace and give everyone what they want
to begin with computers can be a issue for people
because it was hot and empty he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist
also many thing require a computer
i am one of those people
they grow and mature everyday developing physically and mentally
dear local newspaper i am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways
you can take this any way that you want but i hope you learn before it is to late
dear have come very far with technology
did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety natural education and their social life
you can look browse at things available in a store
i want people to get along with each other
i ask why some individuals would want to give one freedom we do have away
the family created the mood of togetherness especially going through hard times
the authors mood did change with the setting and before it got better it was worse
the computer does this
you might think after reading this letter
the author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story
the second problem is the cyclist lack of water
this is when someone gets bullied online
dear local newspaper you like computers
of course try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling which is computers positively affect me
the book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views
what have we do to people
learning about places is very important because you could get lost
i do not think that i would have that type of experience if these books were removed
movies that are funny entertain children daily some children even quote movies and make other children laugh
when students go on the computer they can chat with friends
that is why i do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries
have you ever set somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply
another reason that are using and want to learn more
libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities
my second reason is that computer could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school
after leaving our gabs in our room we went to disneyland
for example you find a website but its not suitable for minor
so what are you waiting for go out and go your computer today
computers can help people learn about news in the world places and people
the second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life
i hope you now understand my position on computers
about half way through the paragraph was when the memoir started to get very
i also think that all books have a purpose to them
we also get water from rains
spending time with family
it is very unhealthy
whenever there is a vacancy suitable to their qualifications they are considered for it
it has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves
it does not bother me when they do this
dear newspaper of the use of the computer is a controversial topic
you can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there
it has four wheels and two doors
i just think that computers are ruining the life of many people
social networking sites like and are all over the internet
there are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection
they have books that a teen who normally read
a computer also helps a students interact with friends
the features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water out of date information and rolling hills
i get so engrossed in the book that i often to eat
in summation help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families
no matter what there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is whether it be a book or a song or a movie
he arrived at the first town which was a ghost town
those are the noises of pinball on my computer
when you start to notice that your family needs a vacation what is the only place to look
he was looking very handsome
so now you are sitting around the computer eating
most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends
now you can d everything from your computer
was happy for the simple house they had and was grateful
i bet that if computers were taken away for year then the changes in health would be drastic
we also use milk to make yogurt cheese cream and chocolates
if censorship in libraries actually happened many authors say forget it and not even right anymore
computers help people communicate learn and even provide entertainment
it could also be offensive to people based on who they are or what they do
i feel that the offensiveness in books music movies and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries
computers seem like a perfect resource
most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated
a recent poll shows that of people in nursing homes who learn how to use the computer have much better brain function
maybe someone with the next big idea for the future
if we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book we are teaching poor life lessons
this also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it
not only did he practice baseball but also typing
did i convinced you yet
the character decides when nature is symbolically reborn and renewed she will start again just like nature
dear i think that computers are beneficial to our society for example computers are very helpful to everybody
the roads got windy and small hills occurred
this shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey
have good times and cheer you up when you upset
when i made a i talking to people who go to my school
computers do not help you brain in any means possible
they can been used to look up information talk to family and friends music etc
before i began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do
a little sparrow comes and sits on my window sill every day
on the internet course
i had never seen an airport before so i was very excited to go with him
newspapers publish articles titbits and many other things
they wait for this period impatiently
after all computers can be educational a social networks and fun
lots of people life that we had computers they have lots of benefits that come with having computers
what experiences did you have
you can search up your friends name and magic
there are lots of books that are at libraries around the world
the answer is most likely going to be a yes
the answer should be simple
lastly censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people
one major mood in this memoir is love and loving
it was real troublesome
remember that the computer be great from time to time but it can not live your life for you
his parents passed down their culture to him and he is happy that they did
if the boat is rowed by more than one boatman they should have a perfect and clear understanding
i hope i have convinced you to see my side of the argument and thank you for your time
in such ways this can show anger
when it comes to music these days it seems they always sing about love being hurt physically and mentally and so on
for example i used to go to an awesome camp and i made same of my best friends there
you can also learn about interesting facts or places
to help improve this people need practice
saving trees help us stay alive
i also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir
this represents his knowledge and experience in the matter and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience
millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference
features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story
she plants it in her garden
since we were only little kids to adults
computers are changing the way everyday people live
we should never give up
whatever you do just get off your computer and go outside or the gym for exercise
so as you can see computers really are needed
did you know that obesity has gone up since last year
it is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster
two years ago a man named years old fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by
my final reason in this letter of why i don like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends
my opinion on the effects computer have on people
certain items have different forms to them
nearly every person has seen heard wrote or said something that offended someone
the children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out
all of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist
financial loss is something that many people are concerned about
if we had a library for music would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for
as a child it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong
my first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school
they should stay away from computer for a time
i as a student a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book should be allowed in any library
so computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication
works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive
if the reader does not like it and finds it offensive then they should not read it
or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out
thank you for your time
its not like they are watching anything bad
for example you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area
this is another reason computers are an impact
president even says the computer is where of the world gets info
but the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance
this has a great effect on the cyclist both physical and emotional
because i only enjoy reading about the romance
next time you turn on that laptop think
if more people had computers then they would the to questions
as more and more people are becoming accustomed to using computers i believe that this is having a negative effect on society
for example swear words such as the ones argued in often times show the characters traits and also improve the setting
this is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves
i think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child
computers have become the most helpful source of technology
the authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines
we have the technology why not use it
everybody has their likes and dislikes with music books movies magazines etc
for one you might forget what you learned
yes i do believe computers benefit the society
in the memoir the author creates a mood of love and community
in conclusion the computers
the flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments
also due to the high amounts of information online schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year
censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect
it would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book
movies can affect someone especially someone who is very young
no one is to make people to get people offline
however he found out that there was still people around
the first reason why i believe this is because one a lot of schools will need them for students to do projects
the cyclist had very little water for his long trip
also having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class
people all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say
authors put language sexual content and violence in books movies and magazines to entertain certain crowds
along with the internet there are programs such as and which help people to learn a new language or write on the computer
plus learn how to type fast
my final reason that computers hurt us more than they help is addiction
i was reading a book called of that i had picked up in the child section
censorship given by the parents or guardians is the best way to view censorship
this is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive
out of gas and you need to go to the library before it closes
in public libraries i think there should be sections of books based on age level which most libraries do have already
the computer is good for doing homework you cant then always
my last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage
he setting of this short story affects the cyclist
the were hills that made his ride difficult
censorship is a major problem in the
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
people who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money
not and old one because it can breakdown
everyone is welcome in the library of course but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want
there are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist
are great because you keep in touch with you family and friends
see photos of a sight most people would never get to see without the internet
there are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries
a policeman is a familiar figure
serious actions might come from the objects and later on come from the same child that either listed to saw it or looked at it
search engines like or yahoo provide answers in less than one second
there is one form of technology however in my opinion has revolutionized modern day living as we know it
reason being is that that was their store and we had no right to remove anything
the computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something
one of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings
the setting effects how fast hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal
with a computer you can find out all of that information
our status feelings friends and position in life are always needing to be updated
if your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet
these books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material
the more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be
so it depends on what type of things are in the bookmovie or magazine
i have observed people and were all different so why should our thoughts be to
computers make things a lot easier for a lot of people
that and the lack of water
sister loves nature she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery
she i nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home
computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide
she should be strong and follow the flow of life
there are many different selections in reading for example adventure mystery comedy or love stories
he thought i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
players have to look at an incoming ball and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball
is a form of where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings
was very into reading
but using a computer can solve that problem
so censorship is really in the eye of the beholder
the use of computers is great for everyone
the people who are addicted to computer are missing out an doing something fun with some they lose or enjoy to be around
every one knows exercise is important
it prepares a man for the day’s work
for example if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway they could type in the place and see what it looks like
let the libraries be
censorship of books should be if a book is not for children keep them away from it
we all love cuddling and watching movies together but not all movies are right for us
that is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues such as books on race or religion
there is less time to do things with your loved ones more negative impacts on your a rising number of computer addicts because of our modern technology
the mood that the author created was very happy and full of joy
the reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from in
dear readers if i told you that every time you sit in front of a computer you are that much closer to death
they allow to talk to people thousands at miles away man instant
thinks that the same book that hated is a great book
rated stands for sexual act language and blood
online is a great place to chat with friends or family you could keep in touch
that if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them
everyone spend time with their family having fun together celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is
so you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project
any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please
in rough road ahead do not exceed speed limit the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings
finally computers type papers and essays up faster
a god fearing person will never become sinful or violent
parents can not always control what their children do
this can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place so they will not do it
that is why i think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands
now is the time where our technology advances
they caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination as well
there are books that were banned from schools throughout the country
everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion
he memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus
an for friends this is a good way because if they move you can talk to them on this
i was thinking to visit a suburb of singapore
that is the top secret of the happy life of my home
computers help us expand our knowledge all the time
all you need to do is type in vacation spots and click enter
if not for advances in technology people could make me right decisions
as a result computers would improve the way we learn
she is on her way home from her drivers test which she just failed and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop
example i have a project in and i have to learn and search about forensic doctor and i search everything on the computer
kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions
it can be useful to both adults and children
from my own experience i used to stay up late for hours using websites such as because everyone else was using it
computers also broadcast news
with the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination
the majority of students today crowd around a computer while they can be taking care of their body
in the there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information
people who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in or playing a computer game
she complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them
people speak about computer literacy computer courses
electronics kids sit on the computer all day long while they should be out exercising and keeping fit
that happened to one of my cousins last year
there are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know
computer time is fine in moderation you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it
if one was to go through the library and burn every book they did not like there would be scarcely anything left
the first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills
many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual
i have read many books over the past couple years and i find that many of the books that i read have proved to be educational to me
computers can be great things
there are no bad reason that could top any of these
the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways
on the other hand computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
the setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride
first you get a head ache then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy
the paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
they also help you to get ready and not be stock in your house on that nice day in
now that you have read my reasons i hope you like them
censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy
to me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was
you just got to know how to avoid it
censoring is a good and bad thing
go out and have a marvelous day
should be removed from shelves
another mood is relieve
if the plant was strong it would not be quivering
it also shows the importance of the hibiscus
authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library
books are sorted by genre
well for starters they help slow the waste of paper
my first reason is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life
another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice
students like myself of often use computers for many reasons
the explains one of the more major downfalls in and how it brutally effected the people struggling for life and money
he is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in
then i took a round of the platform
but the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience
you cannot control what everyone else says or does in books or movies you have to just be in control of how you look upon it as
please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial people do not spend as much time on computers
we are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal
first people have different views on what they find offensive
why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive
in the story there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist
i hope this essay changed your mind about computers
if you buy a computer your life would be more relaxing
he did not dwell on the negatives did not say what he would like to change
can go to ask question and get an instant reply
to censor or not to censor
dear since electricity was invented technology has developed at a rapid rate
we need to decide whether computers have positive or negative effect on people
not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over
in doing this will connect to other ways of life
computers can be very helpful to many people
have you become a better person for doing so
teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it or someone killing another person
unfortunately it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority
if you do then you are wrong
for some books this can take years
there it is with the date exactly
they also are great for research
in the it stated that we have the freedom of press and speech
in the beginning of the story the author is happy but towards the end grows upset
because of the excessive heat he needed more water which shortly became the conflict of this story
i have three cousins that live in that i never get to see but with computers i can talk to them all the time
they help with projects and homework learning new things and communicating with friends
yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence
the author was also very grateful to his parents
my point is that with computers finding information is fast and easy
this was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water
they also said that on being on the computer has taking more teens the streets and in their homes
the animals are our best friends
these are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me
they are the ones who he eats with plays with and etc
i personally think at a certain age they need to know about this stuff
there are tons of things you can do on a computer
these three magazines talk about how to be better in bed
everyone has things that would offend them whether they admit it or not
if someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion so be it
they have three fins and a beautiful tail
time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem
some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent
being able to type essays play games and socialize and order products form websites is just amazing
most said it was flat but later came to know that it was not
second reason is because their taking time away from trying to learn stuff off the internet
a world without computers
second some people would try to band a book just to start drama
i also learned how to row a boat to show my class how crossed the river i learned that by taking on online course
if a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them
even when chatting with friends online the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet
there are three main things that can get you in shape
what kind of books can elevate our nature
but some people are against it like me
my father filled up a from
it is situated in south delhi
it could be a website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future
through the story he had all but a few slips of his water left
the feeling or mood that i think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood
if you need to know state capitals you can find it in no time
however computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities
if you had a computer everything would be easy but nor
humans also pollute water in many ways
in past years censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
inside there were pictures revealed that my mother was not to happy about my brother seeing
these were some elements that effected the rider on his trip
and violence has a bad effect on children and teenagers
of population teenagers have and chat
dear newspaper computers does have some cons but they also have a lot of pros
also the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid
he could not get any water or any directions
also when you meet up with them you have more things to talk about
do you want to use the computer while your their
censorship can protect a child from information they are better off not knowing but it also robs them of a chance to gain vital knowledge
between checking email accounts and updating the average person spends of their day on the computer
she feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home
but i started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer
plus all she had was a map her bike and an empty water bottle
the peacock is a very beautiful bird
just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article why take it away from others that enjoy reading them
is very important to spend time with your family
other material however most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that
sometimes life can be so cruel
this makes them curious
love is the mood for many reasons
and you can also look up places like or if you need to find out where a place is use
the second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring
the kids are to blame to
i have a feeling that person is not going to be happy and you will have some explaining to do
not only is happening in the libraries its happening on televisions also
i know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch
so should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves or should we keep them anyways
in order to do this you need a web
that paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end
she is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home
its a library they are going to have a bunch of material
no it is not easy to get over but these things will make you stronger
helps to maintain strong bones
to always look at the map
after cutting the cake we played many games
that is why computers are not useful
what would you do if you picked up a book where someone is being teased about their looks and
the pavilions of delhi rajasthan karnataka and uttar pradesh were very attractive
for example i was going on a band trip with all the other band students and on the way there we put on a movie
one can also attach documents that consist
computer presents to kids through
the author has the right to what they wrote and should have the opportunity to have their work acknowledged
a recent study done at showed that of kids older than already know how to type on a keyboard
two of us went to the police station
where would be without computers to find information rapidly
at the same time i believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something
next people can actually make new friends in the computer like pen pals
but these things can be done by government alone as these require big resources organization and manpower
would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read
keep this all in mind
everything that happened in that book was real and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
some people do all of their they get obsessed and then their family leave them
many features of the story effected the mood of the story
the setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist
the snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration
this statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do
this vow at the end of the story shows her willing up to be strong and come through in the end
other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see
firstly computers can entertain
she herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see
what is the extent of reading that should be read by the public world
should be taken off the should be taken off the shelves
i can think of at least three different sites that have online games
like science math or history homework
she snow this as a test for herself
since i play basketball volleyball and softball hand eye coordination is extremely important
he was grateful for his parents giving him all they could
it seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing
how their doing and what have they been up to
a lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate especially rap music
not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex
there where many different moods that the author created in the memoir
of course there are other outlets to acquire books but the library is one of the greatest outlets
they act as an information highway and connect people together
communication is needed for many things to make our world better for generations to came
people enjoyed perfect happiness without fear or sorrow or disease
first of all he was traveling in the which means it was very dry
whether it is basketball football baseball track tennis or my favorite thing to do skateboarding
when he crosses a snake it suggest even more despair
just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter
i personally believe that computers do benefit society
this has caused tension in relationships
the answer to this problem is strict censorship
computers are also a massive social network
you can see here the positive effects of a computer
computers do have positive effects on people
i was informed by the parents that their children would never get time to play
this means there was no water available for him
in this memoir author makes the mood happy
if the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves
the example tells how she feels down about failing the test
how could you become physically fit
to begin with the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems
now onto my third and final reason
there would be no way in pleasing everyone so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves
the geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time
this shows him grateful to his parents for passing on their culture to him
it is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place
dear are many books music and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes
thank you for reading this and have a nice day
the advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up
libraries do think about what information children view
and finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way
books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning
it is your choice to read it
finally it can help them for allowing them to a web page
by tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right what will come next
however i think people used computers the most for communication
woman and are the same no matter what people say
we trash a movie after only reading the title never even giving it a chance
for one its more respectful and for two everyone can have their own thought about something
second of teens living in the have become addicted to using the computer
its a happy mood showing memory
if you have dinner with friends and your late with text you can send them a message and they should get it in no time at all
when you don interact with your friends your friends might not bother trying to talk to you
i believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only
they live on the other side of the
loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health
anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone
in conclusion being able to communicate with others on a computer is only i of the many benefits a computer has
the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story do not exceed posted speed limit
i have not really seen anything offensive but i have seen some books and movies for adults only
people also use and play games on unknown websites
there still time for change so lets do something about it
if something is considered offensive why put it in a library anyway if its going to be open to anyone in the public including children
he should have lovable habitshe should have good manners
and that their home was a place you could feel safe and protected
have you ever seen a crazy person walking around saying odd or unique theories
we are living in an age of hurry and worry
fortunately a big tragedy was avoided that day
this means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke
newspaper and readers computers are a very large part of our lives and society
technology has developed majorly these past decades
that is why the story ends with that sentence
this quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men
than parents all you got to do is take those songs away
i believe that there can be both good and bad effects
they do not have to read these books it does not affect them
a public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in
there are some material that a adult need to help in life
the thing they have to understand is that children need to grow up
you can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go
the juice of the young mango is sour
please keep reading to hear my ideas
what do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer
to band all the materials you believe is inappropriate will leave the shelves empty
she would succeed in the spring
the computer can teach you about any career or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes if needed
this one problem ran also affect you so many other ways
spending time on the computer runs up the electric bill
the views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person
so if anything is explicit keep it in the adults only section
you can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results
those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children
thousands of books are censored each year
no matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff there is always a way for them to see it
helps the environment
some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music
the winter represents an obstacle for the flower but it will live through it to thrive in the spring
and a lot has to do with the kidnapping
computers are keeping people from spending time together
when it is raining outside your parents are at work and you are by yourself and have nothing to do turn on the computer
it be fun but it could also but your health
also people have the advantage of learning about faraway places
people get addicted to the computer
plus while so much you will be prone to using in thus you with nothing but a bad grade
as he rode on his confidence only faded more
they could have never used one before but then they learned how easy it was
in my opinion i do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read
in the end we must ask ourselves was it really worth it
this fact itself proves our nearness to the animal kingdom or the animal world
the conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it
they have to be used in moderation though because exercise and staying healthy is good
if they have one copy of a book it will begin fights
i could read from nameplate that he was the librarian
and we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening reading or watching

it should be protected from water

like when you go to see a rated movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie
these kind of game also bring people to dangerous
anybody that is years of age or older could be in there
the computers are ruining family connections
everyone has there own way of writing and there own imagination
but why waste enemy going to travel agency when in the internet instead say travel agent

other then that i think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past
so if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from
that is my only ambition
no one tells me what to wear or say so why should anyone tell me what to read
in the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong
but should libraries take them off the shelves because of this matter
you can interact with people all over the world
these materials can be found helpful to others
most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times
without a doubt i firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction
my second reason is because you can learn about far away places
media can range from newspapers to magazines to the radio and through the television
being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes
this made the trip harder for him because now he was focused on finding water and not on his ride
the computer gives you answer to question you have
they are constantly sending emails typing proposals and all those things
if libraries censor their books then other materials might start vanishing as well
there is this one thing about computers that remains constant
polar bears whales of different types and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem
also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overcharging by
libraries have all kinds of books
they might as well get ahead start on it now
both young and older people need to be educated in the worlds past history and the present news
this angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the affected and shaped us into who we are today
if a child has permission to access a certain material then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate
the hills would make any riding more difficult
every reader seeks out a different style
they might not like it or do somethings towards them in there lifetime but they have to live with them
whenever we have any problem she comes to our help
the second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home
dear the i understand that you have some concerns about computers
then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed which was before she bought the plant
dear my name is and i think that everyone has a right to there own opinion
the most important thing i think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph
true they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous
but computers can actually do the opposite
just pick a book that has a theme you like
we entered the airplane
one of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at
this means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane they can just play a game or watch some television
if you ask me if i think censorship is important in libraries than i would have to say yes and no
but when he came to his second town he became ton on water
you could use your computer
but the people that enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them
my last reason we get to talk online
she also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding
technology is a beautiful thing indeed
that can be very dangerous to your health
in conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power
think about if we were to tr and give everyone what they want would that work out not good at all
the features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him
so just let us choose if we would like to read material with uncensored things in it
he can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steals or rents them from our local library
hopefully others will agree with me too
but try this think of a book that changed your life for the better and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it
make it to were you have to show an that says you are or older to get in
i arrived at the first town
the author of winter hibiscus probably chose to end the story that way because then its ending with a sense of hope
they do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans
would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer
the hibiscus also reminds her of her home
i think that we as a good country should make sections into what people can read and cant read and it should depend how old is the person
luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well
the next morning he is excited and rejuvenated ready to bike again
out of all of them chatting is the best
libraries are to help people with information fun facts and all around good resources
in conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive
the conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist
every age would be bothered by this
being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclists energy he needs for riding his bike
he could not swim across the lake
the ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies
do i believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
when he sees the sign it read rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
in my opinion the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries is sheltering our world
how about go on the computer
you can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web
this affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again
they should feel safe letting their children look through all the books at the library
good manners are very important for a happy life
more and more people are going to become like
like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long they do not get enough exercise
there were bumps along his ride and the sun beating down his thirst he became less courageous and less optimistic
it lets you see how people are and what the place looks like with a virtual tour
dear local newspaper i think that computers are a great thing to have
first since he was in a desert the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts
this shows that this plant areas a lot to here
first reason is they teach hand eye coordination give people the ability to learn about far away places and people
i think it should be open but not just anyone
the main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world
however there will always be people that could take offense to others ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech
computers are great people friendly pieces of equipment but as technology evolves people are beginning to rely on their computers for entertainment
the driver came out of the bus
the main mood he created was thankfulness
sister also helps me to nurse them in the evenings
some of the age limits throughout society should be put in libraries but other than that the decisions should be left up to the person
we want them to be apart of our big events
this memoir focused mainly on friends and family getting together to celebrate
when really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious
computers are the ultimate way communicate
all they wanted me to listen to was christian music and i did not like that
just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is offensive to everyone
by next spring shell be used to her new home
they know more stuff then my parents and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier
the way he lived was the mood of his house
i would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are
i do not like seriousnatured people
this is how kids are helped out by computers
these are about computer how people spend time on them
this sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident
if you use the computer its bad but if you use it in moderation then its a little better
finally drug use should not be issued in books to kids
the people cannot catch them easily because they run fast
people go to the library to read study and to have a quiet time
in conclusion i do not think offensive materials should be remove
as my mother had said i remembered everything
we can use different tools to set up a slide show while also looking up information on the internet
so the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist
the final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay
this would make parents of younger children happy but also the people wanting to view this material happy
the possibility of defeat should not unnerve us
others might not think anything of the item and move along
who is to blame for opening the book and reading it
people miss out of a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it
the mood is happy because it makes you feel the love he felt living with his parents in that home in new jersey
you might be able to get rid of a few but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them
there once again he is thanking his parents
almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor
another way is that of water from severe heat
censorship in libraries differ in certain areas
computers just add to list of excuses not to do anything
in conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future
i think they are good because they help kids with social skills they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world
moreover computers are doors into the real world especially for residents of
if not then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit
the paragraph says in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
computers do teach you more things but they also have games
the library has educational movies for children that not be available anywhere else
should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive
these are all things that affected the cyclist very much
i think this for three reasons
he almost collapsed because he is so thirsty
this can be viewed as metaphorical also
they include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy which not be fit for some people
she can feed him which she ca do online
i thank that all of the books and movies and more should not be censorship because people have a right to no what they what to no or see
this is an important concluding message because it shows that the author will overcome obstacles in her future
everything in life can have a double meaning which makes it easier to find offensive material
we can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them
i believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials
yes we should keep the booksmusicmoviesan magazines
long distance phone calls cost a lot
i know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions
these are all great ways of using the computer
in public libraries books should not be censored movies should be censored and music should not
they have the freshness of a dream
if people are so offended then they should just stay away from the books that the certain author writes
this world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me
yes i know there has been rumors about people threatening over chats
libraries are very interesting in many ways
among those effects are ease of communication ease of gathering information and ease of find entertainment
he raised his voice against the british rulers
he was running out of water in the desert
some people think that using computers deprives people of going out and exercising
the mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented
government service according to me is meant for the mediocre
another reason is the computer can help you study a place too
by keeping such materials shown or on display cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions
one feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat
remember the words of shakespeare
no one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition
and talk to friends more easily
is a very calm and happy short story
she said when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
i was missing out on a lot of things
over all computers have a positive effect on people
with over a billion different points of views residing all over the world why should books that only a few select find inappropriate people be removed
those websites could help a lot in our education
last customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make
to who it concern you take away books because someone might find them offensive
do yo think censorship is a good thing
this is not good for a growing teen
if a you look back to the times before computers you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child
so she had a great idea
the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot
my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers
students can read and borrow all types of books
the kinds of music people listen to
in the end when he finds a place to rest he turns it all into a lesson hell surely abide by follow the map
i do not remember anything bad in it
so if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots money
the last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh
so why should we force others to believe something we think
when children go to a library usually they will not do so alone
he ran out of water not to for into his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in
for example your friend live the other side of the globe you an your computer and message so you can still talk to them all the time
everybody could use a laugh every once and a while
you no if books have all the information you need for school project or your own family history
no we should show them we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life
they should be able to explore however they desire
even schools use computers
this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die
here let me help mother
i have always had a deep passion for music
we should go out and enjoy nature but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as well
all the times i go to the libraries i have never come across a book that was offensive
for many students they need computers to help them understand their subjects
then the cultural program started
a cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere
later on he realizes his water was going down he is getting tired his mood changed to exhaustion defect
even worse then the books we read
very many people are just too protective
this shows that even though someone write or speak out against the majority opinion they can say whatever they want without being punished for it
my friend is intelligent but he is not proud
at many schools students are asked to write research papers
you could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog and or play over a friends house
people are becoming more and more lazy these days
the railway station is the place where people wait for
computers and technology today have had a very influence on very many people
when i entered middle school i read the books anyway i had the ability to make my own choices
when he came to a snake in the rode he had to get by his dehydrated state
the author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water
no but i understand where others could find it offensive
he also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated
some of our media not be the most appropriate things ever but we can still learn so much from it
in conclusion i think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise or interacting with family
with any luck id hit a bump and ledge one in my throat
they have the right and freedom to not pay any attention to it
he believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump
thousands of students who cannot attend a school college or a university are taught through it
its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die while most of us do nothing to help
parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in imperfect world of ours
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood
the trip was also a very long one about forty miles into the petal causing him to be tired
if there ever was a need to really look at something and give another chance this would be the topic right here
music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases
the features of the setting affected him in that sense
most common type of music that you can find in the library is or music
we live in a world with many different ideas thoughts and beliefs and we all need equal right to share them
if you ever wanted to go bowling but you never had the time you could play a game online
a lower selection of books means less people have a reason to go there
the language was not meaning to be used offensively but simply to state how people talked and how things were when was alive
last but not least most people don eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer
many people been buying them at or
i understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life
however when adjusting to a new area you should still remember your past home as well
i know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her
now more then ever you will find offensive things in libraries
for me i only go on the computer for like twenty minutes then log and go back online later on in the day
i have never had the interest of hearing it again as i felt that the story is not politically correct
they can entertain you because there is games that you can play
in his attempts to make it to that next town that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did
that way you get what you need done
as soon as the recess bell goes students rush out of their classrooms
that just goes to show that one does not keep such skill in check they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site
all these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved
there are also books about politics
also this will stop you from interacting with new friend and your old ones will find new ones
we can get just as much information out of books if we try our best
so we cant blame that
many people have been very thankful for this system
read on and see why i disagree
eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated
dear newspaper i think that using your computer too much is bad
then comes the rough road ahead
that is how many people feel when reading that kind of material
lastly if you want information on a particular school you can just search it online and find its website
so the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors if it is contained within your library
online news is widely popular extremely beneficial to many people
many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist
one parent thinks is bad another not
when the government is making decisions that effect us that personally do we still truly have freedom
chatting on the computer is great
the first problem was when he came to the fork of sorts as he put it
lastly due to the rising demand of computers companies typically rely on computers for jobs
the computers are cool
in conclusion the author depicts a mood with distinct traits
i believe that computers are a great invention
computers also give people the ability to see understand and gives information about people across the world
dividing those specific materials into their own section and regulating who check them out is really the best way to go
this is also a good way to get kids from reading things that not age appropriate to finding something that is
the cause stress and unnecessary drama
imagine a world where we had never heard of or
if those kinds of movies were not there in the first place his parents would not of had to worry about it
dear the average teenager spends hours on a computer daily
instead of banning the books or complaining about it them people could try a rating system for books
their house is like a fish market
i think should be a matter of choice like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the
finally there is heart disease a top killer in our country
for example i had to research a person my project all i dis was type in his name pages full of information popped
the unity that the neighborhood has formed
if you ask me there are a lot more offensive things on the then there are in books
the reason why this story is caring is because they all the people stay there and they aid them until those people could move
do you know where your family comes from
surprisingly another thing you can do is work online by setting it up at work or telling your boss how to do it
hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball
then he takes rest for some time under a shady tree
it reminded me of an amusing incident relating to a parcel that never reached
he says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills
all of the flowers reminded her home country
the rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey
artificial simulations are no mach for the real outdoors
computers have internet websites and search like that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the information and pictures or that subject
the flower also represents adapting to a new place
“you must be the change you wish to see in the world”
after he reached the first town he checked his supply
he was running out of water the sun was beginning to beat down and he was probably tired of pedaling
that book is absolutely offensive
this is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist with what i believed was my last burst of energy i maneuvered down the hill
the first was the terrain which started out flat then turned to hills
a lot of people over used it too
the features of a setting could be a number of different things
computers are a great way to explore
oh sure says sue sarcastically
certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at
computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites
i believe it should be handled well mannered and it should be moved to a not so easy reach to a five year old
the reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and need it for something they are doing
that is the second reason why i think computers are good for people
computers have information to teach you but that type of learning has its consequences
reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before
first heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water he is running row on
last reason why computers help out in society is you are able to talk with your friends online
they are published in many languages
she always tries to keep the house neat and clean
dear editor i believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday
nature can affect us in many ways by weather by terrain as in this case by animals
we must admire their hard work
you can go on the internet and look up directions
they should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends
not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family
many people say that computers are useful
should there be censorship in libraries
mr david is a wealthy businessman
even if your not doing school work you can find anything on the internet
i think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some stuff in it that little kids could look at or watch
i think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour
in addition the computer benefits students very well
others think library censorship is wrong that people should have access to whatever material they please
the first reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because they help students as well as many other people study
as you can see the authors tone in this memoir is calm and sad
the modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle
so i hope you have been i know i would have and there is no doubt is my you will make the right choice
as the geese and the hibiscus overcome it so will she
and make everyday tasks simple
those are some reasons why i think that computers have good effects on people
he was dehydrated toned and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places
a cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
she had been very discouraged by this and she was trying to remind herself of being at home
in this new house many people came over to eat and he felt good around these people
kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all
the match was played in the playgrounds of our school
some books in libraries offend others
or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer
the dangers are always there
not only do computers let you talk to people far away but people close too
the bumpy road is hard to pedal over and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away
so limit yourself time you spend on the computer
the media has a moral duty towards its public
for example companies that mass produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker
most magazines have the same principles as movies do
every human is entitled to freedom of speech
someone never give up and do what he wishes to do
instead you should use this time to be with your friends and family
the internet on the computer allows people to find an answer quickly
i think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change
i think that some people are not getting enough exercise and i also think that you can get lazy on the computer is bad too
often teenagers feel more powerful when they are using a computer
discover how great an impact computers can have on your life with just a click of the mouse
this cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature
when i listened to music or watched movies i got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger
the library is not just for the children but also for the adults
no more driving to libraries or going out and buying games
when they say they mean
every intelligent citizen would that computer have wrong information
when it is hot and humid out i cant play as long
with the internet you can use websites like google and
books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be
you can rent movies music and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them
studies show that out of people say that computers answered their question better than any library book did
for example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water
takes him over terrain not suitable for biking
and if you a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer
when it can be an educational resource it is very helpful
thirdly if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine
it scars culture and ignores religion
they also get tired every easy
exercise be important still with a touch of a button i could talk to my aunt find the right one for me and save my whole life
why are computers so addicting well they have instant message you can talk to people around the world
he provides us with the food we eat
this increase would help many people with low coordination
the affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries
if all you do is sit on the computer all day your going to be someday
the censorship would still be at the library in a certain form
another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs
the path of the planets is known as an orbit
that it was a shortcut
all of these would affect the cyclist because it would wear fear on his physical mental strengths
the playground gets crowded and there is hardly any game possible
what i mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him
it grows well in warm and wet climates
it was then that i had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting
secondly the internet is very easier then books
education is very important even for adults and children
dear the editor of the citizen has been brought to my attention from some people around that computers and technology are bad for us
i also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries
learning from books music movies and magazines is good in a way
if a teacher gives this book to a grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it
the story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end
you need to be doing three things enjoy nature spending time with family and friends and most importantly exercise
family to take time from away from us
most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people
if it does happen we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge
first the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates doubt
these days this is happening all the time
we will try to plant a tree whenever we can
today the world has turned to a disaster
by staying active and being outdoors with your friends could save you from these dangers
also you take your car and go out into a morning drive feel the breeze
they had open dinner where friends and family members came
even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic it will still remain a topic of much debate
and he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water
libraries always need advice
the newspapers carry information for everyonebusinessman politician unemployed people players and kids etc
you can also talk to different people who like you
they even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school
so as a result computers are very helpful with homework and studying
the hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling stay strong
the last example was that he grateful for his parents sacrifice and love
such content requires material as violence drugs and nudity
that it could really make a child and his or her parents feel very uncomfortable
and it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off
you would have to go all the way to the library find the right book and read it
so say when my mom is working or me and my sister are researching something we learn
people have friends and it is only human to want to keep in close contact with them
he actually thought he might die
if you also how the economy is doing you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt
if people removes them so people wont come back to that libraries
the author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown
you cannot see how a character truly feels
censorship in the world is getting worse everyday
in conclusion the setting affected the cyclist in this story
anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web
over of the families in our town own at least one computer
the familiar fragrance filled her lungs
it is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you
first many people actually of the worlds population are generally stationary and line in a local town or city environments
to begin computers are a great source of communication
they would start reading and soon read something that is completely offensive
but as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland
the weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him
no mind is the same so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing
now days there a lot of hard work that goes into music movies and books
these two things consist of the signs
socializing over computers not be as effective as socializing in person but it gives the quieter people
less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on or
it is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants
as you can see many people would be better off without computers
then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by it being so hot outside that he could have had passed out and died
they said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related
the features of the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affect the cyclist
books are incapable of judgment
so that way not only do you get to talk to them but you can see them too
firstly computers are full of great advertisements
the people we have sent to they have a family here and i have heard of them using computers to talk to them because they miss them
the coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth
allowing that music or movie or book to be made and then take it away is ridiculous
one can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book
think of everything you done when you write a letter
you can also customize your computer to your liking
we use milk in our everyday cooking
you can find great low prices on travel agencies on the computer
i say this because computers can sometimes get addicting
the computer also has various pictures which is also good
so teenagers think if they can do it so can i
readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist
not only can you stay in touch with your friends but you can learn about the current events
this heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town
computers in total do not have a bad impact on people
knowledge no matter the content is valuable
dear local newspaper about what the world would be like without computers
i agree so because one it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world
why do people believe this should happen
everybody praised the courage and brave action of the young boy
mostly everyone does the same
when she sees the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus
censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter
people must adapt to technology or we will fall behind and watch our slip away
sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization although personal assistance would be helpful as well
since your body has no exercise the weight fat just stays
this shows the generosity of his parents and the author is trying to create a loving mood
censorship covers an entire multi media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship
before the computer a student had to use a type writer to type their papers
everything looked very small
also you can make new friends
also kids can do their projects
removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere
he had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit
i always hate when i try to get something when you find out you have to be or older or have an adult with you
weather can make them use up their water faster or slower rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower
i personally think certain materials such as books music movies magazines etc
another important thing to remember is that computers are important is because they help you get more educated
the public suffers and their own work also suffers
the last reason why i think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people

in the story rough road ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about
we all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine their not suppose to read
that mood was replaced by short moving hills
not everyone can do these things but everyone who has a computer can
until that happens i hope they do not censor their materials

no i do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them
in my opinion i think that some people use and rely on computers too much
too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive
the mood that the used in the memoir was joyful and motivating at times

the same moods came everyone that was mentioned in the memoir
the author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past
so take them off the radio
i strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group person or community
please read on to understand my reasons
the cyclist had started out with confidence followed by determination then relief
one reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content
without computers i would have known none of this
what if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over
what are they going to be reading
now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible
they help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about

does that mean they should be limited by a public place such as a library
the games keep me company
then the library has a bad image which is a big problem
there are plenty of sports that could be done such as soccer baseball football and so many more
dear have you ever noticed how different our society is today even from just ten years ago
dear i disagree with those who support advances in technology the people who think that computers have a positive effect on people

for example what if you were into rap or the hip hop culture and someone finds that offensive
for example the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing
some music has to much bad language in it
they feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say
many hobbies can be used commercially and it can bring fame
the concluding paragraph to the story winter hibiscus gives a sense of hope for the future
more you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher
i will give attention to discipline
libraries are a source of information
however it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions
whether if for work or pleasure everyone uses a computer
i remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it
instead of walking or driving to the library to find a book about they can simply go online and type in under a search engine
if they limit the selling of these items to minors these children will not have as many crimes all together
a cyclist is affected by many things when riding most being features of the setting
the ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black
we should control ways of water pollution

might take a while but over time people get the hang
if a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them then they might think violent behavior is all right
nothing offensive should be placed within a school library no matter how old the students are
of people that use the almost everyday are students
i take dance lessons twice a week and when i can
dear local newspaper opinion on the effects computers have on people is a positive effect
next there is a lot of offensive things you can find in the library
read on to hear how i further explain my reasoning
in conclusion books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive
she became and cleaner
the cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going
the setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit
the author created a mood of happiness and love
they can be entertained by online games communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world
this way you can save money and trees
race and origin are another problem with some people
it would provides financial health and community benefits
so if someone were to remove that material the person that needs or wants it would not have the access to use it
they should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable
just as the way his parents were to other immigrants
well some people already are throwing their lives away
content that you might think is offensive is the content that really helps the reader understand the book better
my and my have both used internet to reunite with old college buddies or see how far away friends are
if it makes you uncomfortable put the book or article down
it is at this point that he uses the word crippling because he is just about exhausted and cant go any further
this can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need
and how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad
in conclusion in opinion it benefit society
since i did not the website all i got to play was checkers on the computers but one day logged onto it and played my first driving computer game
but even besides having bad people online computers can with your privacy
if a reader chooses to read a book that was marked with offensive content they would have no right to get upset
you can pick from many different music videos and music
there be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young
being on the computer does no good for the body
libraries all over the world are all neat and organized
another example entertainment is when younger brother
this is really what computers are made to do help us
with computers you can also keep information down
the author shows how proud was of his parents and how thankful is
do you agree with me that we should be aloud to read listen to or view what we want
both of which he is still happy to have today
he tells of the courage his mother and father had of coming to the country without any knowledge of the language or culture
do you ever have a question that you instantly want or the to
this obsessive time leaves no time to keep healthy active and fit
he no longer had that much water
aim is a good way to talk to friends and plan get together
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills it will take him longer to reach his destination
are you reading asked mom
for example the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort i think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test
that made him even more thirstier
with them when ever i want to
another example i was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly
did you know that of homes in own at least one computer
dear local newspaper in town use the computer for at least five hours each day
the first reason why i think this is because people in the world are becoming less healthy kids and adults should stay more
many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites
i do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way
there will be charities in other countries to send money to build gyms and pools but nobody will use they
some people enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive
these are the reasons that the author ended with that paragraph rather than some other paragraph
some movies have sexual content that our youth should not see
dear having everything known to man at your fingertips
personal opinions are a part of books and we should respect that
it is the removal of choice from lives
there are many different races and people with different religions living here
the of is undoubtedly loving
all our festivals are colour oriented
with the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on
we again got on the train
everyone has a favorite book
computers are taken away information is gone
water is needed everywhere
this will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read
to conclude materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive
this problem is similar to others around the world
reading this made me feel grateful for what i have and think of all my parents did for me and sacrificed
it would be really good for you to go on a walk in a nice day to feel the breeze and smell all the nice scents
that will not stop me with helping my friends in the future
second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids
also you can keep in touch with friends and family
authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next
the flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life
the doctors advise patients to take at least two glasses of milk every day
it is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around
my reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers less time exercising and lose interacting with family and friends
this will make her more capable of passing the ed test
libraries have always had interesting materials such as books music movies and magazines and there always will be
the story also talks about a snake in the road
if someone is walking into a library they have to be responsible
or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework
so when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward
the mood of the memoir is generally happy
i strongly believe that we need computers
computers can help find ways to do many things such as better medical treatments more efficient travel and even every day life
on the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games
computers are used everywhere for thousands of different things
computers show these advances greatly
censorship prevents learning from those who want it
also you can talk to people around the world
electricity is generated with the help of water coal and even sun rays
of obesity is caused by the use of computers
every where you look people are using computers
he thank them for teaching him so many things as a child and the environment he grew up in
if the items are in a public library they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to view them
talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face
school could be a lot more difficult without a website
he knew he should have taken the right way instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous
when people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer book writer or actor
yes it cause time away from family but you can easily say goodbye to the friend and talk to them later
hi my name is i have a couple topics that i would like to talk to you about
it gives them a bad name
but by using the computer you can find endless information about and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to
well then computers is your online fun source
but if they do not put offensive things on the shelves they will not end up being in a law suit
in trying construct a monument the government and culture find that they have little to build off of
music is offensive but like i said only found in the adult area
every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community
so once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred
in the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist
this understanding that was taught to him had a large impact on his life at that time
the hibiscus is a piece of her past adapted to fit her current situation
now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and he can say the library has no restrictions
even i talk online all the time
bottom line is that you have free will and you have to power to choose weather or not you want to read something
they should just put things aside that they think well be offensive and let people ask for the things
with my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them bad things
in urban areas we can see people keep taps open
our life and property are safe because of the policeman
you do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies
dear local news paper i think the computers benefits society
they want money clothes grain food or anything else
computers are a bad habit even though we might need them its better safe then sorry to do it the old fashion way
the first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not
those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad
computers do benefit the society in my own opinion we do need computers
secondly is a great way to learn about history
my third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends
and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing
the story with this paragraph symbolizing a new beginning about to take place
in libraries are some booksmusic etc that be offensive to people
secondly many friends would get mad if you can see them
he tells us plainly that he thanks his parents and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child
in conclusion when the author talks about his family and his life he gives off a very cheerful and welcoming mood
people like accountants use computer for there job
a big thing that conflict with censorship is the idea of religion
luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well
her life will always be filled with music and love
it would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination
now that is in shape for any sport plays
so why take that information away from me
as you can see the mood of the story is warm and tells us about how he had a good childhood
students stay in hostels and they study also
people do not like policemen because they think that all policemen are corrupt and dishonest
these books were offensive
what are you going do
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
the mood in this memoir is inspiring to the narrator
in the passage do not exceed posted speed limit the deserts feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist
every person is titled with their own opinion but there should not be censorship in libraries
there are many historical works that contain offensive images and content but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history
say its not good for you i hope you liked my prompt so it can go in the newspaper
the a book written by revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry
these are three reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people
imagine being in the hospital because of playing on the computer
censorship is wrong especially in the the citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press
i think the mood in the memoir is love
music is something that everyone listens to no matter is its rap country or the blues
the cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you
so censorship to me is not going to make any difference
i will explain these reasons below but before i begin i would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear
freedom of press is a right not many countries have
the park was converted into a fairyland
we could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold
the water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength
the music will always have ratings just like movies
instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake
so he had no energy because of dehydration
for example kids with cancer or even need to check them can let you talk to this kinds in
including help with the children help with cooking with organizing anything
he admitted me to the first grade
when you play basketball you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination
dear i am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on computer use
just to better themselves as a individual
these online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure
a concern i have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers
items by using my coconut shell trunk or husk
basketball is played between two teams
having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad censorship
that type of book however should not be found in the library
when it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe
some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages such as or
then we can learn fast without a book
mostly every person has a computer and it does not effect there lives a lot
in conclusion i believe that computers affect on people
so they can live in a house
two minds are better than one
being able to talk with people online is a really great thing
for example if you are doing a project for school
some people say that computers make you not be able to see while
times are tough money is tight and electronics are expensive
that in spring she will do better and pass the test
in this case other people can still watch hear or read the book or magazine movie or music
i person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like
saying this is saying that is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him
everyone in the school loves and respects him
everything we see now a days is run by or has a computer
i believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that is also as enjoyable on it is
and i also hope you agree with me
they give him a sense of comfort
and at first they struggled but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future
they can work for whatever company right from their home computer
while many people enjoy the use computers there is really not that great a need for them
many programs let you to people through the internet
i think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing
this way more and more families can do activities together
we all know that human life without an ambition is useless
sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship
i think what you should do its not get rid off computers
so then he runs into the bathroom drinks from the sink
we learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed
reason three your health is in jeopardy
we can live for a few days without food
in the states’ pavilions the industrialists and businessmen were busy finalizing business deals
in conclusion you understand what you can and cannot read
i hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive affect on people
i thought the world would be a better place without me
everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book
most people do not realize what sort of trouble they will start with censorship
features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
i hope you see my point of view
everyone is an individual and is different in their own way
with computers people are the will exercise
the author is very grateful for all that his parents did for him
there going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway
we do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them
you will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children
if you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it
computers would be easier for you to collect research than a book
teacher is a person who builds the nation
and that was something that they could find in
and in any case you have to know what to do for example
now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way
as the author continues you cannot help developing a sense of security
another way libraries can help is put the movies in a certain section
the way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too
what they not like could very be what others do like
of course it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please
before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers
dear local newspaper i believe computers have a good effect on people
computers help people so much in schools work places and at home
the rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist
i think the overall mood created by the author is comfort
they can help with anything
censorship should be only for the youth as an adult you are open to everything
second of all computers people to talk to other people around the world
she is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time
why should you right you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper
the mood of this memoir is defining the love of his family
computers can help people in so many ways you just have to realize it
one is about a soldier in and his present wife back home
even though you hear them daily you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around
what some people consider offensive others not
another issue libraries have is music and movies
suddenly we heard a cry for help
i can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at
he never exercises or take a break
computers help kids too
the movies and music i think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it
said our health teacher
lastly when you have a big project you can do research on anything and everything in the world
we need to preserve through every problem we go through in life
a sense of security with friends families and neighbors
do you think books music movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries
i hope you see how amazing computers can be
you could get to the point to watch out for it also
hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable
imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away
somebody is always going to get hurt
books that are found inappropriate to children or even teenagers should be reconsidered to be removed off shelves that are exposed to children or teenagers
he is always grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice
some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop
illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse
stated that there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
the author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over
he then pedals on but realizes his water is running low
the author is describing these warm comforting memories to help clash with the cold bitter day the girl is having
well that brings me to my next point
therefore it should be age appropriate
in many libraries their inventory is being stripped for censorship
one more detail about the mood is that he sounds very grateful for what his parents did and the hard choice they had to make about moving to
all you gotta do is go to that certain room look for check out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime
libraries will contain safe books for all ages while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves
prayer should spring from the heart
you have your own choice when it comes to what your children read watch and listen to
the trees attract rain bearing clouds and prevent soil erosion and conserve the earth
thanks to computers the process of reconnecting is much easier
computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them
recently it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers
i can understand wanting to shelter your children but you cant keep them from every thing
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly
another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat
these type of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books but have been distributed to the teen section
however this does not mean that the libraries of should get rid of these books videos etc
i think music is what influences a person the most
i know this because in paragraph it says that his houses were he learned the real definition of family
some items are not appropriate for everyone though
this is one of the reasons every book should be on the shelf
when the hibiscus is budding it is trying to start life again
no library wants to hold books music movies or magazines that have been reported by their community and nobody wants it
thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended just look from both points of view
this has effected people because it is a faster ans easier way to write
i think that if you take something off the shelf at a library you can just taking away part of the heart
and that is why i think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir
most often things that are offensive is the truth
it is his daily routine
either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book
i know when i do i pick the object up and look and see what it says on the back
she says i will take that test again
there is absolutely no need for censorship to occur and as history has shown it certainly is not a good thing
in conclusion that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
but there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have historypoemsdramaslovescary
therefore the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air
although computer are good for this they be addiction
the lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad
is fun you play games go on internet watch videos and check your mail
i believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it
also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad
it also benefits society because in a couple years everything will be computers
this could symbolize a decision which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip or perhaps the decisions he had already made
while many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive it still should not be censored
there he works for the whole day
she was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence
if it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves then what would be left on them
when seeing the geese and the hibiscus she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time
computers have been used for decades and i think they will be used for many many more
if a student has a question about an assignment he or she can ask a friend or the teacher
also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others
you not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming
mid way through i came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped
music is a major part of each one of our lives and without it the world would be a much different place
and that my friends is not alright
the author shows his love also for his neighbors and neighborhood even though the was very racist they still came together like a family
my dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music
so just as she vows to take the test again shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong just as her winter hibiscus
trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
i am writing in which computers are a bad thing to the society or good thing
every book music or movie will be offensive to some other person and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read
settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive
there is a reason the rating is what it is
they can submerge themselves into obesity
will leave someone with nothing to read now
when really they are the people with more knowledge
people tend to get moody
more than of are overweight and unhealthy
children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher
plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism or someone being overweight
many people around the world use computers to communicate
everyone has been teased once in their life
then you remember you were supposed to meet you sister but you have a hair appointment
people professors historians and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday
in order for more people to maintain healthy there needs to be a lot of
it seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat
without them would make a difference
there are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story winter hibiscus in the way that she did
computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway
the first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that
i mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves
they should be in the other room to where you have to have like a id to get in
dear i strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer
the changes could be made but if anyone tried to take something important away would you not do anything to stop it
every wants to get their extra weight off but they can because the want to check website or talk to their friends
i went be an ideal teacher
empty shelves would be a horrible look
also says that his family was a lot of people in his neighborhood as well
you would have to have use the bid maps driving to places
not to mention you can buy games like of or for your
people are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear
twice i found myself in very uncomfortable position
the problem is that kids are not getting enough of the exercise they need
each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place
in the same way some people use tiles and others use hay to thatch their roofs
you can know everything about that country without ever visiting
many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age
not only do people lie about their age they lie about who they are
what do you want your children to be able to see in their public library
the mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there and go there
the second bad things is viruses
the mood was a good feeling
when someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely
have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore
even though people think it take time from exercising and interacting with people it not really time
dear you use a computer a lot right
there are several things that explain why i think this
this is another reason why i think computers are a good thing
computers have become the glue to friendships
people should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people
some people were standing all around
another great source of entertainment are video games
you can just open a chat window and talk away just like that
for example your computer breaks or has virus you can just figure out the problem by yourself
also i can keep in touch with my friends anytime i want
computers help people with anything they need
she is also describing that they will start over when spring comes
if so you must enjoy it
censorship is effectively unconstitutional
that leaves us with so much to explore we just have to keep on eye on the clock
which brings me to my next point
i really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library
parents on the other hand also help out their children and they also talk to their relatives or these looking for a new home or job
if a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelve at his or her own will
last but not least out of every households have at least one computer
first computers help out with traveling sight seeing and lots more
people can use laptops out doors
how can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books or books with rude language and scandalous themes
a teacher’s profession is a noble profession he is a nation builder
in conclusion computers do have a positive effect on other people
every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to
some experts think people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising playing outside and having family time
he has to remain on duty in the hospital
reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life
though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages
my second reason would be that computers are useful in studies
yeah i said you think a comp
we all get offended but just move on from it and find something different
that would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive
using computers has been very helpful to our society
soon i was fully drenched
they will want to see the world
you want me to write an to my local newspaper about what i think on the effects they give people
the question is is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves
they can help you do a lot of things that others not
they can say for very hour your on the computer you have to do an hour of exercise
i myself as a take offense to some of these magazines promoting being perfect and having the life sucked out of you as you read each passage
this was all in result of using a computer
when you walk into your local library there are thousands of books magazines movies etc
but until her flowers are gone she will not worry about school
you had a computer you could have simply emailed your boss
this brought his hopes down
maybe you have to catch up on your nightly reading for language arts and you want start reading your goal book
i would have friendly relations with the members of my staff
every place uses computers they are a big thing
so this is why i think computers are a good thing
music does not fall into that category
it is this positive happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive
the open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist
if they limit their time on the computer and do some active game it would be better for the child
it dint really matter
did you that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot
i wish i could play with her like i do with my other friends
another example would be the time i went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems
should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down
he ends up drinking all of the water he has and needing to stop for some more
interacting with family and friends
most hear curse words before they can even walk
do you know that square box with a screen on
some people find that offensive and some not
reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject
computer games and help take the edge off after a hard day
get out and get some fresh air
every one and every thing looked fresh
my second reason is people spend less time exercising
my third reason is we can talk to friends
foe example lets say that you doing on paper you
kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child
websites and search engines help you a lot
also i think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting
the mood in the memoir is love family and happiness
that is why i think the author included that paragraph
if someone was planning a trip to they would check the internet often
when this happens it interferes with their lives as well as their bodies because our bodies need sunlight
the setting can affect a cyclist in many ways if it were hot out he would be thirsty and sweaty
for break me and my dad used the internet to learn about we then decided to go there and bought tickets
the tone adds to the theme of the story
first of all people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up and do something about it
computers are helping society become more and more lazy
they know some citizens are against that content
movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is
there is a mood of love too
they might not want their kids to read it but their kids will still hear the same things somewhere else also
life for our children should be about fun knowledge and life experience but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library
the censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries
you guys can chat each other check up on each other and see how everyone is doing
we should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about
ten minutes on computer searching the laws in could have kept her in
says they are both right
he describes how all immigrants left their country just to give their children better lives
second in a couple years everything will be computers
when you can just open up a word document and type it up
a ship may sink if the crack once noted by the crew is not immediately plugged
to remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame
i will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works
some features of the setting affected the cyclist
with having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst
the computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people
the question is then do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people
you can communicate with anyone you know
in conclusion the effects of computers are bad
this illustrates the power of computers allowing people to do things that were once impossible
there was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy
you get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world
my creative gears are forever turning
will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial
everyone has an opinion and watching out for your children is understandable
in i mite not be into what they are into
when the hibiscus is ready to bloom she will be ready to drive
there are some reasons to which i am saying this
been for computers and
kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world
i also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by
if a person has an interest in a book they should be able to read it if they so choose
if you are choosing the computer over other important thing then i think we have a problem
what if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate
is there nation television channels
instead of censoring our youth of from history we need to set age limits
when you are on your walk you find interesting new species
can books music movies and other materials be perfect for everyone
as evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting
this shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is she will be happy
that is why i think the memoir gives off loving and caring mood to the readers
the cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town however he kept hope and traveled to the next town
music is the same way
lastly the authors mood was very thankful
he still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place
hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die
the community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck
i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it
this way of communication prevents children from learning valuable social skills which come with conversing face to face
books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer
practice you the is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country
erasing things from liveshave done no good before
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful
mr david is a wealthy businessman
they narrated the story of their home
a book is a book to be read
it also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it
how can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child is only or years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs
she had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around
however when you think about it if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive there would eventually be no more books
everything must be taken with a grain of salt
she had no problem going off and complaining i can remember her every word she said it sounded like this
dear local newspaper i read the article and i think that you guys are right because in the kids rather stay inside on the computer
to computers are a benefit to our society
this also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about
this is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents
computers can harm relationships finances and your personal life more than you would think
there is another perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away
songs that really mean something or about someone
the cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him
i have to watch that with my sister all the time because if not then they will yell at you
books can be helpful defending on when it was made
she fastened me in and off we went back to the library
the temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry
social network sites are good for
there are websites that can help you find information
the solution is for the child to look at magazines or magazines
a good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy
we need computers to do this
the firemen got down to work immediately
on his computer and haven went outside
everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story
you can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want
it revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming
learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books music and magazines
he takes the help of p t teachers too
the library is all about learning
research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers
fish is her favorite food
people have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in
a tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood
there are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject
of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends
for instance when i was younger i watched the movie
is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story
not only can you talk to grandma or grandpa but you can even see them smile what children can even such as
computers give you all that
the heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy
in addition he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds they still lived together as a family
attached as people are to computers they cannot experience the world to the fullest
also you can communicate with friends and family
the world is maturing even as everyone speaks and people are learning all the time
i think this because you use computers for school projects
like you are writing an article on dolphins you could learn more about them
next the hills and roads over one long crippling hill
not only that you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online
it says working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength
is a tool that of our nations used
at first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had a smile on
so why do some people think computers have a negative effect on people
these indulged in the online world are less interactive and showed more signs of depression in recent studies
i am lucky to have mr david as my next door neighbor
another point to look at is that people need this variety of education so they can work for causes important to them
the features of the setting greatly effected the cyclist
in our home country of the we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens
they also gave educational games
the materials children see and hear is up to parents
after going around the zoo we came out and sat under a tree
birdie is light brown in colour
the computer is very smart and is probably the best technology invented
difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends
which is good because you can use them at your own convince
really bothers me because when i was their age i had no idea what even was or meant
this was from a world wide poll in
there he had almost no water to get him through the day
an instant message which can be used on any of the sites mentioned can also be achieved
last but not least computers people are world in communicate with each other
buses were late and overcrowded
these are only my views on the topic and also these statements are my opinion
its almost as though its taken this plant to show her to get back up and pass the test
they are also a great way to learn
one such feature is the hills that are present in the essay
heat hills and ghost towns all are features of setting that affect the cyclist
according to a survey done by the only of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week
i agree with these experts too
computers could also be used for good things
the project took me days to do while it took him a whole week to complete
it is understandable to have a little tone in the with some knowledge within the eyes in a book
if you speak out against a powerful figure you go to jail
when people go to the they know no matter what information their looking for they will find it
they will also provide information and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea
you can keep in touch you can learn and you can have fun with computers
without the the is just like any other country and has no direction
finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future
scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place
not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer
the computer saves money for a lot of us
the municipality had been caught napping
along with many other search engines are an easy way to find what you are looking for
i not saying that books should be removed off the shelf just maybe put up higher and be watched over more carefully
there nothing to loose
you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant you use a computer so you know how far
if education is not what you seek you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored
health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst
in my life time i have been to many libraries
nobody needs to be reading those kind of books it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people
some experts are concerned about people using computers and not enjoying nature and going outside
the sea is used as a road to transport goods and passengers from country to country
out the memoir you really start to see the authors opinion of the definition of home and family
the cyclist is worried he is not yet depressive and pessimistic
again the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert the high temperatures and the bad water which he could not drink
books are not racist so other people can be made fun of but to learn what they went through
it is always good to be able to contact anyone who is wanted
rated is want they our now letting children watch and buy
they do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part
so he drank from his water bottles frequently
go on a vacation get away with your family
i think it would bring us back a couple of ages
if a book magazine movie etc is found offensive then you should just walk away and ignore it
i believe we could organize our books movies music and magazines in a different way
censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one
for example my grandma and grandpa both live in
for example people die of
would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them
it be offensive to you but to the next person it might be a really good show
overall the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings
one way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages
the author says vowed to express positive connotation in the paragraph
computers benefit the people of society in every possible way
it is found almost everywhere
computers are a great source of entertainment
they provide pictures stories and actual videos of whats happening right now
now they choose to surf the web instead
you can also interact with people far away
students of all classes visit the library as per schedule
the show you how to get to a certain destination
these glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot he was running out of water and there was rough terrain
the author creates the mood of friendliness
when he comes out a man is sitting on the porch
he started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation
or how about a new hat for your friend
the two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring
his task is very difficult
this would create a corrupt society with a lot of fighting
through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense
it causes there to be a lift between family members
history of our country history of our and history of sad and hard times
even if the are across the country you can still chat with them for free
so how are we suppose to know what offends who
in my opinion i think that the author sets a loving mood
would you rather being sitting in a chair staring at the computer or having fun outdoors visiting places you have never seen before
my friends say that computers are a waste time
they could not wait to get on that flaming red bike t go play ball with joey
they let you communicate quicker
i would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and i would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten
now is the time to agree
libraries should just contain what they were made for encyclopedias dictionaries books and other books that can provide useful information to people
i personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to
humanity has the power to get off the computer and go outside or be social
it is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone
i think you should consider less computer time
how would a library handle this situation
online predators lurk as many comers and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen
one you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other knowledge is merely a click away
censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear
another thing i would like to consider spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing
but do all these exercise plans really work
without computers life would be harder and boring
to paraphrase i not agree with what you say but i will fight to the death your right to say it
reason why i think that people are not spending too much time on computers is because can help you in many things that you need help on
he told himself that it was no use
computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world
movies have a rating system for a reason
the internet will provide you with any information you need
also it symbolizes rebirth
the book are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past
and that is why we have fights over a book
it just made me think she has to be really happy with her family her house and her life
dear i have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and i would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions
new is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town
if you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go
furthermore enjoying nature is a must in our world full of immense landscapes wide waters dense forests and lush valleys
having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get
the cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about
it can also destroy companies and our lives can give limits and computers can used to exercise
the second day of this festival is a special day
there is a great rush at the school canteen
the author made the setting seem long and unbearable felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand
if it is found to be offensive to an adult audience then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library
it can tell you about crimes that are happening
then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water
the place was full of people from different countries
do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer
i also think that the materials on that shelf is allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot no matter what
in this essay i will reflect my views of this subject backed by true facts that i have learned from many passed experiences
secondly computers have a positive affect on people because it saves people time by shopping online
one person lend that book to another therefore the offensive book is being spread around
computer usage has its ups and downsbut my point is safety health and education one the main issues we face because of modern technology
now it is seen as one of the most famous works in literature
obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the and it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day
my mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films
one reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information
the author has left her home and moved to another country
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder
there is only the problems it is abandoned
now an you can text people right from your computer
in fact you can get millions of great recipes
dear local newspaper opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers have a good effect
finally you can find pleasure in computers
any time my friends and i have a question about anything anything that happened that day
music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things
that is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library
i myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for
as you can see it would help kids with whatever they are studying
no one should be judged by which sex they like
do you want that for our youth
make the change today
if we do not then usage will increase there will be no chat problems and peoples money will get stolen
maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and every one swarms the stand attacking each other
i know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what i have to say their will be no doubt that you will agree
another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work
i know i do instead of being home on the computer
also after taking a poll
nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read
of the newspaper i hope you and the rest of the community can see that computer help you more that they hurt you
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start
in the end of it all a book is just a book
so in all ways the computer is anything but bad
she plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol
libraries are public for a reason and that is to interest people with different types of entertainment
there are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music
so being on the computer does not make you smarter
this saves the biker progress and most likely scared him
this is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story
it helps people write better and better
if any book is subject to criticism or opposition are not all books worthy of the same
limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world
now imagine if we were able to stop that
three reasons for opinion is
there are no books besides maybe math books that offend at least one person or a group of people
people are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the
many libraries offer music movies and magazines to check out and to take home
with a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips
this conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future
some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier
the way that her parents helped the community out shows their general love and kindness for all
for example say there was a historical fiction book about racism
for example computers are good for motor skills and what about school work computers help a lot when you forget your homework log at school and lastly sociability
a novel by was banned
the internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has new hope and determination
not only is it students but most people get news from the internet
they are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph
thanks for taking the time to read this
your honor i have my proof right here
with the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind
materials like that can offend many people so they should be removed from public shelves
some books have been previously censored but became uncensored and brought back to libraries
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
computers can help you with as well
if the source is something more adult then it should be placed in a section that is labeled or supported by information that says so
if all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off how would someone write a report on those things
i read about the delicious food and rich culture
from the computer we can learn a bought a faraway place if we were doing a report on it or just our of curiosity
he believes in simple before his students
it was difficult to pass the time
i personally do not think that anybody should be punished for what is being put on the library shelves stores like music for instance
if few people disapprove of a particular material the book remains in most shelves uncensored
as it would only make sense to try to keep the peace
it is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them
plus there are many different disorders in the world
for example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card
the second choice should be a loss of internet services
in the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip
parents can usually monitor what their kids check out
huge buildings looked like small huts
if anything happened to him there is no one to help
the cyclist had to go on for miles seeing anyone or anything
movies are good about it though
some reasons why i think this are school work and business stuff
everyone hates when their camera or video camera breaks and will their precious and wonderful memories are gone
whether that means faster internet better researching book or more websites a computer has it all
all of the features in the setting had an affect on him which made him powerless and thirsty
the author also described their friendship with their neighbors
our librarian is also very helpful
set in the drawingroom
a library wont immediately buy new books about it
how do you think that author would feel
oh great another hour day of school
meant that if know about people and places different than use do not have to be afraid of anything
people have a right to do what makes them happy
i would take a wild guess that they are mostly about sex and violence
books are things you read
set up programs at your house or town for turning off the computers
the issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see
do i believe that certain materials such as books music moviesmagazines and so on should be removed
games teach us the team spirit
like i read one time about here doing something that was bad and she should not be doing
thank you for taking the time to read my opinion
there was a little boy at the age of nine or ten it looked liked to me but he had two movies in his hand
such areas are dry sandy and very hot
i think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days
you can do many things on the computer to have fun
while computers are helpful in our lives too much of one thing is never a good thing
dear i think computers have a bad effect on people for three reasons
the mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad
having a or allows you to do a video chat with someone
if we are at home and we forgot our homework we could look it up online
in the essay rough road ahead the setting greatly affects the cyclists
with computer you will be able to talk to your friends cant talk on the phone
also the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story
no one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or
then the story takes an unexpected turn
the cyclists features around him affected him negatively
today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere somehow
they also solve geographic problems
computer have a positive effect on people
education is also a useful thing you can use with computers
dear you think computer have a positive or negative affect on people
the third effect computers have on people are it gives you something to do
after all this sorrow by putting in a hopeful ending the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future
they are also known to have a very good memory
this setting also establishes a happy sort of mood
computers have dramatically changed lives forever
when that happened stopped using the computer and went back to basketball
when shielded as a child they would not know what do to if the chances came to them to do drugs or drink
you can swim in the beach feel the amazing breeze and have a good time
the library is open to any and or everybody
just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college
now a great change has taken place
it should still be some type of book with some kind of censorship to it
also when her mother said you what
computers do benefit are society
though there are so many people yet no cheerful voices are heard
it is a fact that you can survive without a computer
who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries
all teaching them is how to kill people or animals or do dangerous things were they would hurt themselves
people that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record
dear newspaper editor computers have been a great advancement in technology but some people think otherwise
the library holds books of past and current writers
something has to be done to put an end to this madness
so in strong opinion it is a good idea to have a computer
these are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday
women and children can find all of these materials offensive
the ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better
it said yes and then it showed me a of information about
he has a small family
i very resent and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book
when i read the above statistics i came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing
so if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site
his mother is a teacher
library workers should also make sure the adult materials stay in the hands of adults
i think the mood of the is warm caring comforting and very loving
also it depends on what what the ages the kids are or adults
thank you for reading my opinion
censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually
she is very popular among the other members of the staff
most people east sleep and drink computer
i can also remember going with my grandparents
i think that computers do benefit us
the cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth
another reason is it shows how confident this experience has made her
to get a feast of colours we should go to a well kept park
they are here for a reason
books are an important part of the learning system
the answer to that question is easy
also you must have a membership to that department
three out of five homework assignments are on the computer
now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive
the reason why i think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want
so go on a computers and talk to your friend even that person a picture or something
if censorship was practiced everywhere there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out due to a large amount of people complaining
there was no one around that he could ask for help from
one decision is to either buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one in a little bit
there are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things
the of gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind
in the story he said i and the growing
we learn and understand at different rates
secondly i would talk about people who talk online way too much
it is all a big chain with many loops
finally computers take away family but also schoolwork and works
until he got courage and slowly gaining elevation while losing hope
in conclusion i believe that computers make peoples a little bit easier knowing that they have vital information right at the tips of their fingers
you have to watch out for magazines too
i know i like to go on the computer better then carrying really heavy books home
libraries are for people to check out books or other sources and not to remove books or other source off the shelves
this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph
there is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive so why take them down
one reason why people benefit from computers is how they help with education
i know if i was a parent i would not want my young child reading of a violent murder or gangs
there are people that love writing about violence gore and segregation
this child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it
to like or hate what ever is on the shelves
it also explains how crafted his parents were and how intelligent they were
her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying
so you can never trust a computer
however when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar she is determined to adopt as well
only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer
due to this computers are without a doubt beneficial to society
just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer
computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away form them
the world would be upside down without them
he could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion
these must be apprehended and taught some craft and made to work
i know for me the internet has come in handy for school projects or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word
in following essay i will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such
maybe a friend can help with homework
then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people
and then we have no books left for any of us
the would always have junk food when was on the computer
in conclusion computers have a very positive effect on people
there are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch like instant messaging systems mentioned before
computers effect us in a very good way and they change our every day lives children these days cannot type
with all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop
the mood created by the memoir is very explicit
i believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure
i came to a ramshackle shed and several rusty pumps the sight was troubling
made their slave through ignorance
nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding
that is the mood the author gives off in the memoir
when libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books
but i disagree is many good effects computers can have on people
while someone dislike a teen magazine because of how it effects youth another find it inspiring
just as much as putting into the adults section
second it helps us connect with and meet new friend
one setting feature is the rolling of steep hills
but one must not censor libraries
the creates a mood that makes you think about your self and your family
if you want to know more send on
even little things like if your going to your friends house then take a jog there instead of your bike
because this program we are able to stay in touch
once that they decide to meet in person with these strangers many things go wrong because not everyone is nice they seem through the internet
if citizens keep sitting there then we will became unhealthy
it helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play
my outlook on the effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive
if you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature
the people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive the way people take in information is the main factor
i do not think so those words give power to the book
everyone wants to live like there dying or in other words live life to the fullest
it is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do
those would be either getting trouble at school memorizing a phone number and the dialing it or talking to than in person
the internet is a wonder place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics
as you can see these are the reasons i think it has good effect
but at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life
the cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting
my friends say that this is very unhealthy research as proven it and my mom has had experience with the computers
are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some
that is what the computer is for
almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another
truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth
this is a free country which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not
the mood of this memoir is one of love and kindness
people have and always will want need and desire different things
its now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not
it symbolizes togetherness and coming together as a family
most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are
further along he said there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
without the computers people would be lost not knowing what to do
arguing just decreases the social time spent
that shows that the geese were kind of like her they were moving to a different place to start a new
guess what the libraries have some of these compact discs of these artists that are played on this radio station
everyone has a different personality and different perspective there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different
or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young
the only time they let us stay long is when we maybe doing a project for school
this is so because he talks about his parents with a passion of love and respect
an then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
this website lets people upload videos
in the spring the hibiscus will be budding again
the mood in this memoir is happy and joyful
this is why computers have a very good effect on people
taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment
in this period they do not eat at the day time
lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read
i know i would not just for my kids but for other children also
the winter is the current season and spring is on its way
the cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak
that is how the feature affected the setting
dear of is all about computers
send in another person with different tastes and then you have a completely empty library
that quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly which means is adapting
i say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off
also imagine going to work and not having a computer
most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem
finally the reason why computers are so important is because keeps people in touch
he keeps the class registers at the proper place
i know you are and tell the world to not getting told by the computer what you can and cant do be the boss control
the arguing will never end
this is why we need to keep them all up
in conclusion i think computers are a great fun and helpful invention
they feel it should be locked away as if it were some eyesore
i think that censorship in our libraries would be a idea and i think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries
the computer is a wonderful thing
there can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap
in the story the cyclist was affected
when talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun
computers help people with their job
after that she took us for a walk round the garden
throughout the ages we have been evolving from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly
a great example of this is the series
one way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted
in paragraph he describes his home growing up in great that makes it feel almost like you are there
a library is supposed to be a variety of books
i was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online
it amazing because the computer helps lots of people and jobs
all in all i think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him
computers are the thing we use today
kids theses days can be mean with out try
we need to get these types of songs out of our libraries
it can be found offensive at time
it is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose
they think it is too explicit but another not
they should be able to write sing or film what ever they want
books are a key to learning
that someone else happiness is the true gift of life
most of someones life can be saved to the computer
i am not saying that i am totally against censorship of certain things like nudity on television
father was scammed or connect on the
i can say that books and songs have saved lives
you lose a lot of friendships like this
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
so with the computer computer
distractions are everywhere
our body gets ultraviolet and infrared treatment from sunlight
thank you for your time
sit on your back pond and go bird watching
in the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed eventually nothing is left
in this show there is warning label stating only be seen to children and older
he thought he was let down
he had tumbleweed a snake and he was dehydrated
because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers
magazines could be offensive by the words used such as slang words cursing words and violent words
they talked to their boss made copies had meetings drank coffee and most of all they spent half of the day doing work on the computer
taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well
also they say that you can learn more about someone in minutes of playing with them then in minutes of talking with them
instead of being on the computer all day spending home with family and doing activities with them could be more fun
some people make some ornaments and fancy
ignore the adds on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them
i for one think that the computer was come to be one of the greatest inventions ever created
one way to get rid of this problem is censorship or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public
i think that if it goes against something in a bad way is should be removed and gone
music has become a way for people to express them selves
it also a great way to make friends
the features of the setting in the essay rough road ahead
most of the jobs in the world have one part that has to do with computers
to begin with the boy is very so grateful for his parents and adore them so much
in my own opinion i think the setting is the most important part
libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs
after that computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live faraway from you
there is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive
having a wide range to select from would keep the guests always coming back for more
i do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon we might just have to keep living with offensive products
when people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not
it gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive
i know one of my friends love to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time
if the book is based on true events nothing should be censored
the majority of movies and books have relevant information portray events that could take or have taken place and teach valuable lessons
he got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water
now need on so can all up
computers benefit society by using online
second everything will be threw computers in a couple years
first i believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material
there is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another
this way life with computers will be beneficial after all
that is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs
everyone in this world is different and we all like different things
there is no way a child could check out an offensive book take it home and read it without their guardian knowing
when they are sad mad upset confused etc
this mood is because the author is talking about the parents hardships
dear i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
that have been proven
these are grown ups using the tools available to improve their lives
however i believe that from this quote even she agrees we in fear what our children read
should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in
her white gown made her look like an angel
he has to get up early in the morning and begin the day with a lot of exercises
i think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
false statement or inaccurate statements in books can lead to public curiosity and even conspiracy
one feature would be the terrain around him
i know a lot of people who love it though
when they need to order supplies most times they will go to a web site and order online
it even gave websites on the back of the book
people have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country
oliver is my best friend
the mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful
and you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer
the nation owns accounts on socializing websites and the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups according to a poll taken
especially if it is by their favorite artist
if you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on
you can also see each other through a webcam
a computer might save your life one day
that is only one of the reasons i think computers are beneficial to society
this material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth
in twenty miles he saw camp
the materials be controversial but they still are pieces of literature that deserve to be read and studied by the people of the
children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television
money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture
he has great civic sense
a computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager
in the cyclists opinion things began pretty well
we can talk to friends online and we can learn about people from the past
the hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion
magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine
also there is the television
some people see this as a great advancement
the final problem he faces is the
as we were reading the book i honestly thought it was a very interesting story
some jobs you have to apply by computer
hockey is my favorite game
sadly and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones
censorship has been the topic of many debates involving politicians activists and the everyday citizen
not physical strength but mental strength
the short story winter hibiscus end the way it does because the narrator realizes that with simply comes a new chance or opportunity to start over a rebirth
could you live a day without a computer
his family had many rich culinary skills
it broke everything down into details
i will be talking about do think books music or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive
i myself have family in which is a whole continent away
that number shows that over million people use these
it also gives me exercise
which helps in most cases
you can google the book and find an online copy of the book so you make the grade on that paper
with computers we have enough for each kid in the class
computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors
she too can make it through the cold months
and you can see them
sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but informative in many ways
for example some albums that contain offensive language or topics have stickers on them
a reason why i think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person not be offensive to another
if wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well
computers make people happy and that makes for a better society because it is happier
when you can talk to people from around the world
anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion
so you might as well make good use with it
by ending the story with this quote it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home
with all of these exceptionally great things we can all live in a happier better world
you would be like a couch potato
if something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against i believe that the book or books should be removed
you the parents are heading to work while your child goes to and enters into the wonderful learning center computers
aside from being a great source of communication computers are fantastic for searching and research
another good thing about the is it offers mostly reliable information
many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life
if materials are offensive they should not be displayed
to sum it all up i think computers can benefit society a lot
they contain many different styles and genres of books
not me i would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake
they have been dating for months
the computer can also effect you mentally and socially
computers play a large part in the of the world
media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive
when you are on a computer have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan
once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast
the first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride
lastly people tend rely on computers too much
some thing you can to get them to go out side with you is take the computer away for a week and have fun with your child
first of all they are a great way for kids to have fun people can learn very interesting facts
they also allow communication with foreign countries
that is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away friends friends of friends etc
you can learn about history sports you can learn about current events in the world
this would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill
then continues after seeing what that alone has done to her rapes and beats her
that has yet to become the problem
certain materials in libraries should be removed
he also misbehaves in school constantly
in conclusion the mood to wards the article i think happens to be grateful
a poll was taken and out of kids of them said they felt groggy and had headaches after using a computer for two hours
a local teenage boy says
you never have to worry about not knowing whats going on
a guy travels to where he meets old timers and the give him a shortcut to the park
my friend likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts
seeing the beauty of nature and spending less more with their families
the geese and snow she admits are the things that were strange before and had become familiar to her now
for example news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish
dear newspaper editor i have recently heard that some people think that computers have a negative effect on people
who can find enough room
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants
i completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today
she must be determined in order to pass the test
i like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive
another reason computers effect the lives and people the dangerous chat rooms
just keep in mind the dangers of the world and how it wants your money
many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed
so what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a
they also allow people to talk to other people online
the test that she failed tested her memory of her home
after coming back to india he practiced as a lawyer for a few years
going back to my introduction my first reason was you can find stuff online
the cyclist had trouble finding water he needed and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions
they have seen blood gore and other things in these games and movies
you finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen
you stop using computers you deny yourself this magnificent way communicating
so just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves
i think it would be a crime against to censor things in libraries
parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies
there are many views that one can have on a single topic book or idea
the next day i went to take my exam
according to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist
i have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight
i firmly believe that this is correct
they help you find information about many things on the internet
in spring the nights are cold but the days are sunny
would you think that this is a public place and everyone has their own opinions
many people are interested in these movies
the way an author tries to entertain offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone
next reason is computers make life better
people value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is
you spend hours on the computer or even hours
computers help function machines
depression is all over the state even the country
when a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like
this sentence shows me that is slowly getting used to the new place
if they went them they should order them offline mail at their house
then their would nothing left for people to read
movies are located at libraries as well
the author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written not the way you would like to see it
using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all
when the scenery is pretty and cheery he is happy as well
there are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites
secondly purchases can be made
you can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it
we reached there in the afternoon
i think computers have become part of our daily life
the simple answer to this highly disputed question is no
your family and friends have always been there for you
now lets get started with skill
in this country we can
there are running program held at our local beach where you can exercise or even run a small competition
they also keep you from enjoying life to the fullest and can separate you from friends and family when not controlled
i would not like any books removed from libraries
some computers have programs that teach you how to type
then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day
the mood created by the author in the memoir come in different ways
however we still have to be reasonable about it
consequently certain people use computer because the help you with certain things
the computer is a wonderful thing
censorship should not even exist
my mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job
computers have far more positive than negative effects
that is what i think the mood of the memoir is and why
it really showed what he called home and what he called a family
i was working on a long history paper and essay which meant countless hours on the computer typing
thus goes on the season’s cycle
censorship in libraries
sometimes your closest friends are across the country you want to talk to them
why get rid of books that others read
spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer
another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information
i feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library
some of the books that are banned could relate to someone and touch them
the human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology
nothing that is what we could
therefore on one full moon day he abandoned his family
but other movies are not even bad
the land went from straight to hilly
this gives off the mood of hunger for great food
people have many different views when it comes to these things
another example is paragraph ten
the mood the author created in the memoir is grateful
instead of playing sports games on the computer you should get up and play one outside
magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library
a sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat
i think computers need to stop taking over our world and start just being there when we need them
has your son or daughter been on the computer with great has been over
i had no idea that she had cancer
the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist
the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop
since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be amazing thing to another person
even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person
no i do not believe just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does
at home i prayed for his quick recovery and return from the clutches of such noncooperative hospital staff
i have heard of many books
i hope you can see why computers can be good for people
first computers has its benefits to society because it can teach or give you the social skills you need
i strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer
company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the one ever
try and change what the reader might think about that time
the parrot is quick in coping with what others say
but i still think that there are ways to use computers without the bad cause
this is not unexpected considering it is a memoir however there were few statement facts and everything was personal experience
why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there
this creates a full understanding of the test and hibiscus
i would like to thank you for reading this
earlier in the story it explains how the winter hibiscus does not die
this day and age is evil all around the world
everybody is unique different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas
sooner or later everything will be based on computers like jobs school and ever the medical field
this is important because when kids get bullied the feel bad about themselves
almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent free of worry and trouble
some people say that computers are a bad influence on
some materials are offensive to some people but not to others
by removing the problem we would be creating another issue
some of the most interesting books that i have ever read are offensive in some way
i know what is out there and some of the books or movies are not always kid rated
then in no time you will be hanging out with your friend
once most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place
concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home
their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read
cereals are a very important form of food for us
you can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling
we should respect him
the library is a place for peace and quiet so headphones are necessary regardless
i do not believe that certain materials books movies and magazines
our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong
people who stay to close to there technology will be addicted to it and they will start to kill brain cells
“an eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind
these brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people
they find these things to be offensive
from the mans point of view he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for
taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it
the policeman is an important public servant
thank you for listening to what i had to say
libraries should not have those kind of books music movies magazines etc
these people have a shorter lifespan
so else how bad the computer is
as the story progresses the cyclist is no longer so confident
like my mom gives me a limited the computer my laptop has to be off on a school night
it makes her feel more confident
books can be used for many things
one laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze
usually this game requires very tall players
this lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on
mercury is nearest to the sun
otherwise each one will do so differently and cause a mishap
their mother keeps on shouting with them
one the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker
if the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children
they help people in any number of ways
the created by the author in this story is a couple different types of moods
so think about going on the computer all day and night
cousin lives in and the only way i can ever talk to him is through a computer
more than of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers
dear newspaper this year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online
lastly the author created the mood modesty
although that is true typing is very fats and neat
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
that would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library
finally as the earthquake in i was able to donate through the website
show cool thing you have that are new
for example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words
my first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick
also another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people judge almost every little word offensive then
you should always think things out before you take action just to be safe
second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about
many people use computers for research jobs shopping homework and more
he listened to some old guys and he lost his way
go on a walk or a bike ride or walk your dog while riding a bike
people need to stop complaining about everything and just do something
the sun has a great influence on all living and
with all of the details the author creates a loving cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends
people make their own choices in life
when online students can receive help from fellow students teachers and even experts
does that mean i want to totally rid the world of those certain materials
they let us look things up by easier means than a person or book
also computers are used for many things
being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world unable to enjoy the beauty of or send help to the starving people in
many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared
you can research just about anything on everything because the computer will have it
when they be spending all the time on the is because they like to be online
but a public library is for the public
computers are what they say now a days are one of the main reason children spend less time with there family
another reason i think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information
people drink camels’ milk
in conclusion i think that people would be more from using computers this is because it is easier to work with
you ask what it is i am speaking about
we put all of our knowledge into them even hundreds if not thousands of years ago
say if you an your friend has the same computer which includes webcam video messaging and more
they live in a beautiful house that has bedrooms
books are another way of learning as well they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it be
now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with fiends and family
by outside and enjoying nature taking walks runs or even hikes you can get your exercise
also research for school could not be done without the internet
setting in do not exceed posted speed limit really determines how the story turns out
they need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer
you can find things on cars trucks sports and made up stories for fun
certain websites let you access tons of knowledge
this mood is a mix of many things
in games including of etc
you then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard
this can lead you to getting glasses or possibly going blind
to make the growing unity of world possible development of psychological health is essential
ashamed that she failed the test she still showed her mother the flower she found which was not like the one at home
finally the internet fools people into believing they can go on easy diet eat
the main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged
the love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family
the person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for miles
not to mention the process is exceedingly type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need
i am not in any way against reading books rather i am quite on the contrary
we all are given the right to our opinion on such pieces
i rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face
as you can see the computer has an impressive list of entertaining for all ages not to mention sites like or addicting games
its a lot easier for someone to sit on the computer browsing aimlessly on some social networking website than go out and actually meet new people
the realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book
he wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion
when on the internet kids are capable of accessing anything and everything
my finale reason as to why i think computers are good is they can help you on homework too
if all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library would there really be anything left
there are negative and positive effects for each state
yes i know they are about thing that happen in history
computers are a great tool to help us with our lives they help us learn skills for later in life
many if you were deployed to an army write in
i believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves
or overcoming obstacles
people can speak believe and read what they want without the government interfering
there is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples moods
people are using computers more often
when she had a question she would have to ask somebody she know
computers are used for many things like school work planning that trip you always wanted to go to and reading the latest news
of those said use computers daily and not just for work
computers are good for society because people use computers to talk to friends and family on and
when people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas not any younger
that saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees
first off they can be dangerous
these negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society especially teenagers the most frequent users
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
the censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too
cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society
we use computers to purify water
some people say begging is an essay way to live
finally computer allow one to talk online
they should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it
writing is a form of expression writers can express their thoughts use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters
especially because he no water then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster
the cyclist just thought his life got a little easier
everything in this world can be offensive to somebody
i do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf
have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library
another example is this
when i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it
the heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired
if they want to play that game or read that book they should be allowed
my last but not the least reason is kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer
you stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story
it is practically the same with books
i would have to say no
i think that computers are great
the policeman should be honest polite kind and literate to serve the people
it is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer
is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events
computers effect a lot of people
it for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things if at any time
the computer is very useful when it comes to school
they should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games
was being question about his birth certificate
have you ever gone on the computer
it was dry and bumpy not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there
last i want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material
so these ideas hardly leave any other opening for me
if its cold you need a jacket
so then making it harder for him to go one
how can you tell when someone is of a mature age
but our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air
flowers bloom and trees put out new leaves
can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them
children are directly affected by computer use in family settings
is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside
they also have lots of websites for help with a new language
there is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see
of people agree that the invention of computers helped our nations to be closer
if books movies magazines music etc
kid just sit at home play computer games such as sims video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them
there are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning
there are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known
my concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives
this made him hotter than he
when they come back in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
their library card would show their age and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young
the mood of the author in the memoir are grateful and thankful
most people try not to be overweight
that is why there should be censorship of certain materials to a certain degree
that would take to long to do so though
every movie book and magazine have information about something that you want to know
for example i mostly have how time to go on the computer
certain materials such as books music movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves even if they are found offensive
computers can provide people with ways to research things
i have found this important over the last few years
in conclusion many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people
to help us with tasks or for our personal use
what can the general public do about this
this book is one of my top five favorite books and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned
they use it a little too often
their are so many great things out there that could be put at risk
another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone under age rents a movie or there parents rent the movie
for example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water
so therefore he knew he was in trouble
she was neat and clean that she got promoted
dear i believe that computers do have a positive effect on people
they help us research socialize and they help our and economy
than it keeps that mood going when he tells us about all the people that come over regularly for dinner
do you see much difference
that is debatable but by the same token in school we must learn about the despite the fact that it upsets many people
snakes are poisonous
when gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family
for example many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of the book that wrote as a sort of mission statement for
more important things should be done during this time like studying or doing homework
people have always had a right to view what they want and read what they want due to the freedom that this very country provides
also throughout the whole memoir you can feel the happiness when he talks about eating dinner with all his family members and friends
this is happening all around the world and it need to
it makes it difficult for him to bike
music can get too extensive as well
an author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders
out of have said they are their are spending to each time on the computer
if the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business
getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer
games on the internet are also very bad
if you like to play video games
i mean i love romance and scary books and someone else might dislike them both
and also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it
some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family
his father worked in a laboratory and his mother studied chemical engineering
example is it helps students with homework
the building was there but it was abandoned
his father also lives with him
the mood kind of shows his attitude of hope and that his parent hardships created a good life for him
i remember one time when i first started going outside i had so much fun
they are the true protectors of the nation and our lives
heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert desperately trying to make it to the next town
another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting
my brother listened to rap alternative and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir
others like it like you like your favorite candy
books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately
he got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead
for example if something is thought to be offensive then it can be placed with others like it
technology holds you back from the real things in life
computers have little to no effect on people
and that she would come back just like they did
holding free and impartial election ensures democracy in true sense
kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it
leaders of a library have many different sections in their library
ever heard of social networking
the mood is also sad
in my conclusion about this article
not everyone is offended by the same material
one example is the rapper
it is a great thing to bring some light to their dark world
in other words she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through
it will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner
in a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please
as the author describes his life growing up at home as a child he seemed to have a pleasant life
i felt very alone and stupid
music on the other hand could be thought of as different
all you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way
all you need is computer of course a microphone or headset some speakers and a special software
they make it easier to find information and typing skills
the cyclist was losing hope yet he was still determined to find water
computers also can teach you how to speak a language
my mother had completely got cored
but computers are spending to many times on their computers
some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age
in school kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved
the features in the setting such as the ghost town desert and the juice factory give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness
allows people to talk to family that lives far away and it also helps to make new friends
in the end computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society
the factory even made him more thirsty
online shopping having a positive affect on people by making their lives less busy is a great reason but there is one last even greater one
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
i think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it
my last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment
when purchasing items online you never really know what your going to get
the setting affected the cyclist in several ways
people always go on the computer and love that are an save at their
genres were created for a reason
censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems
if the world never reported accidents would be too much crime and terror
and try to find where you like and come
it is that some people get very loud when there looking at magazines or when there music is turned up way to loud
the girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over she will start over too
the youth of is portrayed in mostly a negative light
computers are advanced our world little by little every day
in the essay do not exceed speed limit the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways
it all depends on how you look at it and what type of person you are
technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way
his method of teaching is convincing and inspiring
books music movies and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time
anyway even if we try to go on different sites we get redirected to a blocked website
when the hibiscus will budding she will take the test again
not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books
almost anything like these could be considered offensive
a lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them
the community and comes together to help out those who needs a hand
they were all friends and had a good bond
his family always helped people who were considered family to them
it gives students the to learn different places
this is why it should stop it hurting are environment people are becoming lazy
also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them
it is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live
they attempt to teach their children the basics that drugs alcohol and smoking will corrupt their health
another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people
computers help people stay organized
computers have even made our society
in the memoir gives a loving and caring mood to the readers
instead of sitting at the computer all exercise
my grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad and got so upset he cursed at the and almost threw the remote at it
but you stay home to webcam with your aunt
he had eighteen miles to next town without much water
offensive material will be out in the world
if people were not allowed to take risks what would become of our society
when people bought his records in the they had to be covered or placed in brown papered bags
the cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign but he kept going
and that is my view on this subject
this is the mood created in this excerpt
doing so would could and be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child
computers can be addicting and cause us to play for hours
also the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid
studying is also made easier this way
one example is conversation many people have close relatives that but over seas cross country or even across town
the kids should not see them or know about them at all
for example there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
i thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese
additionally people all around the world have become addicted to the internet
fellow i painfully state this fact
yes computers benefit the society
we need to have these facts available to the general public
it lets you learn new things and research
also the narrator compares her to the geese returning
most young adult books have something to do with teens drugs violence and other things that would come off as offensive
my parent got rid of our books a wile ago because of computers
some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family
they could be talking to one of their family relatives
is supposed to be a free country
there is nothing to worry about
perhaps somebody else has been waiting to find that book
with a phone you can only chat with each other but a computer has a webcam
his still in a good mood when he comes to the first town
now she told my family and i that she was badly offended by what they were called and what they were about
magazines are like books in away
now we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work
there i could get the leftovers to eat
the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist
although there are some positive computers can be dramatic
you could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit the setting affects the cyclist in many ways
this say is said but its not followed
which makes it more entertaining than a book
that but it did say one thing that surprised me
computers are changing the world throughout everywhere
about a hundred students died from playing the deadly game
different types of books explain different types of things
the cyclist in do not exceed posted speed limit by suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert
also you can have the ability to talk to people
dear newspaper i think that computers have a good effect on peoples lives
that is why i think the computer is
it does this by having the author point out how little his house was and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life
we enjoyed every single minute we spent
think about paying somebody to count your taxes year after year when you can save a fortune and do it yourself
there will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group
he was very happy with who he had become and how he had been raised
the cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there
other poets of nature who have impressed me most are keats robinson
throughout my own experience i have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge
others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression
a lot of things are done by computers computers also prevent you from wasting money on books because you could just google it
these sites give people a chance to find with old friends
so why have censorship in libraries
but the big reason is grateful is her family
it all really depends on the reader
dear i would like to notify your business that computers benefit society
another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels degrees
in conclusion computers do not benefit society
however i also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain material
when you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing just sitting around would a computer solve that problem
there are many reasons this paragraph is included
using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening
someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs
it helps education because always use computers to help kids learn important information
the adults use computers for there work ability and in schools
everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy
have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf
when your in school you need to type lots of prompts labs and vocab
he sad when i tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid
then the next week or so i got an email from him and so now we can keep in touch with each other
so if they had the right to remove that book i would have never got the chance to read that book
i strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people
he was saving up his energy and his water
is expressed by the family gathering a the dinner table more times that not
by using electricity for this nonsense device we waste money
id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst
first the geese and hibiscus both have a goal which is to survive the winters
in the memoir the author created the mood that made it had a close relationship
throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster
i can never play with other people with online multiplayer
do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone
the mood that is created by this story is admiration
this upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before
imagine if the library did not have a certain type of novel you enjoyed would you continue to go
she will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do
therefore i strongly advise not to take any books off the selves
if it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard
of kids are overweight and that is unhealthy
it was more depressing
this setting greatly affects the mans journey
you like the sound of this
without the services of a postmen life would be paralyzed to a great extent
this shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way
the mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house
some enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while my prefer the thrill of a horror story
the mood created by the author in the memoir was simply love
i believe that books are too important to throw out just because they contain a few vulgar words or images
because than enjoying the fresh air and open fields has to offer are enjoying or our
in conclusion i believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay
this reminiscing not only reminded her of her past but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home
also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic
there were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water
i believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it
so have i my dislikes are many
computers are very useful
this shows the old man could be wrong and places can change
first by subject down to the author
the desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes as he passed abandoned towns and factories
i got so bad to the point that i was suicidal
lastly some bad things can be shown and can happen while online
but one should know the dangers of censorship
this shows the mood is all about love
if it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it
everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them
why take that magic away from children
our teachers taught us to be nice and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same
even later the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating rough road ahead
but what if i told you that any person could put anything on the internet
studies show that of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time
no matter who you are or what you believe there will be some topics that you find offensive
also in paragraph its a paragraph dedicated to his parents
information can be found instantly
the internet is a easy way to do research
going back to research what about for solving crimes
i would rather have a few offensive books then none at all
also people have the right to go get whatever book or movie they want
kid end up getting bad grade because they spend time on the computer
when you want to read that one special book you heard about but you find out it was considered offensive to some what would you do
dear editor of the i heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and i just thought i would voice my opinion
although on my computer i can actually see her on my screen
a water pump found just in time but the water is no longer any determination they reach rough roads creating once again a more painful journey
chemicals are used in the fields
she had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country
some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills
no longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world
if any of the settings features affected the cyclistwhich they all did this had the biggest impact
no people or cars or any sign of modern civilization
without computers we would have to do it old fashion style
this features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind
my father used my elder brother’s bicycle to teach me how to ride
my first reason why i feel that computers have bad effects is
even if it is offensive to some people
other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching
for example in political cartoon inside of newspapers is sometimes compared with a
things such as horror movies porn and many more
computers can be helpful and distracting at the same time
movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way
finally it gives ability to
every mind that is among the world is extremely different just as every book is
she appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she
protecting your children from things that offend you stop them from growing up badly
with a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth
it is naturally hot in the summer but in the desert it is twice as hot
no book should be removed because someone find it offensive
kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air
all of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it
some for books some for magazines some for movies
if we do not have the knowledge we can take guidance from experienced persons in business
i was excited yet scared
in school you are not offered what you want to read
this represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on
the lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people
also there was nowhere that he could get water around him
censorship in libraries i know as well as everyone else does that you can find almost anything reading related in the library
the problem with the is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people
she has a beautiful white neck two wings a small tail and a tiny beak
my elder sister also attended school and i was admitted to the same school
some of the movies and books people find offensive can be pretty bad and say nasty things and stuff like that
also social networking sites help families keep in touch
being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become
books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by parents
more people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise
it is much easier looking it up on the computer
dear local newspaper i feel that negative effects of computers on people is much greater than the positive effects
the internet was not just created for the heck of it
what be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa
many argue that computers provide quick easy communication help children and adults learn and even teach balancing habits to our generation
people are different like different things
another reason why internet use should be cut down because bullies hacker and terrorists
the last point i will make is that no information is bad information
he is preparing for the matriculation examination
some were enjoying boating
plus websites are filled with viruses and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project
dear local newspaper in my opinion i support the advances in technology
you can chat with almost anyone on the internet
when people excessively use the computer they put their safety and well being at risk
doing that with their life
then what can you do
they need to get off the computer and do push ups sit ups and just exercise
by saying this creates a warm calm mood inviting you figuratively into his home and childhood
libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments or about animals or anything else
this gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since hes traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high
the setting in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit is used as an important for character development
due to this many people have no communication skills
a library should have a variety of books
computers benefit us by easy aces to info
climate location and population all have an effect on the cyclist
i think computers has a positive effect on people
if you have kids you risk your relationship with them
these people although from different worlds and different times and different people were all avid believers in the of humans
but are they are bad for individuals to use as people say they are
computers can ever help people plan a vacation or learn about a country on the other side of the earth
if you need to know something you can just type it in and boom
teach your children whats out there let them know the truth about the world
also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication
books are a form of history each telling a story from the past
he is riding in the desert where there is low to rain
i wonder what it will be like
dear a recent survey said that out of doctors think the advances we have made with technology and computers is helping us rather than hurting us
is a website that allows you to speak to or send pictures to others
dear newspaper has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up
separate desks and chairs for each of us
we can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly
in total computers cannot have a bad impact on people
without all the useful information i found on the computer
libraries have things for people of all ages even though some do not like many of the materials found in them
you can even communication with friends
we saw kangaroos elephants stags deer and ‘neelgai’ etc
another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for
she will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also
in the parents thoughts uncensored content should be kept away from children
just have to control yourself
many people have there own taste in what they like to read write and do
if we censor the material in a library it is denying the public of the real world
i do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a or if there is a need at all
teenagers can play games on the computer
all information is helpful just not all is necessary
also computers let you learn a lot about history
this memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling
if someone got offended by what they read they could put the book down just as fast as they picked it up
however everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone
thank you for taking your time and effort to read this i hope it has persuaded many people
movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times
the man is badly dehydrated but in his determination he moves on
i state this because the web has many things to do
there is no one around to give him a drink of water
the mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better
when you think about it our country would be no where without these spectacular devices
put a and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have just to solve the age problem
we have a right to these books just like the people who write them have a right to do so
however if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out important works would be thrown away
they supply sleepers for the railway line
this could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries
a person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views but they can not just remove them
have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen on a beautiful day outside
this is the reason why i picked those two mood in the memoir
putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places
for example they do taxes paperwork airline tickets and the bank
it shows the mood of how he loves his house
there is hope that spring will come flowers will come birds will come
computers are a great way to talk to someone
we should have the right to read listen and watch what we enjoy but younger children or other age groups should be monitored
the setting of the next land mark was similar to the last
computers allow you to interact with people far away
countless people around the world face these problems everyday and computer usage should be lessened
by doing this a parent knows what their child is reading hearing or seeing
by using censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves
in conclusion the three reasons the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer
another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclists location
so do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn
i think is dangerous for kids
am i the only teenager who thinks this
because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world
what if some one looks up or check out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone
it could be offensive to some people but not all
young adults spend hours on websites like and communicating with their friends
so if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left
it can even help you find a job
the mood in this memoir is very happy and uplifting
those are all the reasons why i think computers are a good use
i say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless
if they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay
i saw the front page talking about computer
all kinds of stuff is fun
the library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of
just imagine watching and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it
there was an abandoned
watch at least one or two episodes of television show
look at a photograph of the earth taken by a satellite from space
the long wooden benches on the platform are always full of
the girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes
however from the examples explained in this paper i have shown that the increases conversation and curiosity of how the world looks and operates
the mood created by the author is welcoming and warm
we get milk mainly from cows and buffaloes
in there neighborhood despite customs elsewhere all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship
they are strong but not too strong to not be put in libraries
that about sums that up
what is this world coming to
sad because is hard to leave something behind
children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also
he then went to south africa
if you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive
as more and more of these books are released the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories
her parents always kept their arms and their door open
the children buy icecream toys sweets and candies
are you going to go to the computer and save a bunch of time
if a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books less children would pick up the wrong book
and in his eyes his whole community was one big family
people can talk to old friends family anybody really
make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read
for the fifth paragraph that i agree that people should not be able to get off of computers
libraries are great for multiple reasons
this not only comforts her it also makes her miss her old home more
i achieved a lot of knowledge by reading various books and newspapers
the cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns
also people go to libraries to find something out
and movies and do business
other books are not some more than others
are removed from shelves then is not practicing it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom
talk them into becoming racist towards others
this helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job
perhaps the multitude of books and songs that we have now would disappear altogether
these are things you can do on the internet
these are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for
i am extremely grateful to computers because i can keep in touch with my friends and relatives
it helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views
computers are used at many
they increase responsibility by giving you many choices
this can lead them into getting obese
and many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about there religion race or anything that involves to there personal life
what would be put in there places
if not for solely learning but for reference
he says that of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing
although can also to one or the bad things about computers which is that people spent to much time on the them
most libraries have children sections
it would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives
ban your children from life in general
in fact since that the computers came out this year lots of people has been spending web to much time of them
many people use websites to check the emails
as you can see for my reasons above the computer has an effect on people
that i could drop from heat stroke
is this really worth losing your friends and even your health
that is the question
these examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist
she was not happy at all i had no clue what she was doing
one day he realized he could do this no longer and got same exercise
books movies and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion and it should remain that way
also if you sit on a chair all day honestly what will happen to you
i feel that yes an or school library should not contain the same content as a school library
with the use of internet people can learn about faraway places without spending money to go there
first of all computers help us a great deal with homework
another factors is the maturity of the reader
the second reason is the computer help you in your house for example you have the big problem with your car or something like that
now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future
ultimately astronomy the science of planets and stars was born
they can also play against people around the world
the cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved
there are other ways to solve this problem
the visit was an unforgettable experience
in the memoir the author creates a sort of grateful appreciative mood
anything put onto paper is legal
you can use the computer to lock up your subject and a different websites will come speed quick to your screen
will that said they use computers anyone to say that computers are bad the that you love do while this
the features of the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affect the cyclist
these issues create the problem of dehydration and when mentally you think your going to die without water
people will find out by themselves what they want to hear or listen too
in conclusion libraries should be extra careful in their media choices
i believe agreeing with you be a very good choice
i think the girl wants to be just like flower
i do not think that is right
in the story winter hibiscus
it is used in factories
for example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained
which i know your parents would like
the passenger was not the one to be easily cowed down
magazines is a big one
with bringing back memories of her old country
lastly for a teenager or older they are more social than little children
well here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves
some people need computers
to not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational the computer is the future plain and simple
the is a place were you can come and whine your day down
it starts off with a beautiful and culturally enriched apartment
a lot of jobs require people to be on the computer
if people are prevented from reading what they want then many will not read period
also pictures on the computer help too
if he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine
in addition i happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks
all he did for almost a week was socialize and beat his personal best score on a game
would you like to set your children up to fail
computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs and other skills you need times in life
dear of the computers are a wonderful tool and they bear many positive impacts on society first computers have created numerous forms of communication
i think it should be
the setting in the essay rough road ahead makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome
so why not have it in the books and movies
in the day described
using the computer is like smoking
computers help people through there trouble
nobody can force you to do anything of that nature
people have the right to choose what books they and what they about
remember though to not stay on too long
the importance of computers in the modern world
that why movies are rated so that a parent could what kind of movie their going to be watching
in most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper
i say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy
well the internet does
it is a whole different word now and it is a lot of old books and songs
but computers can be a bad thing
people need to see how beautiful our world is if we really want to save it
this leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you
many books in the library systems today contain foul language
in the morning we boarded our school bus and left for the rock garden
there are over on computer games online
lastly computer can make people unhealthy
the girl wants to be a whole new person for when the test comes up again
a life lesson of courage
censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it wrong
so i believe that books are more reliable
for example paragraph rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and for which i am eternally grateful
i think every one should have one
books that people say are offensive are usually the interesting ones
some material have sex and violence that is offensive
at this point in time we could even take online college courses
when a disagreement arises no matter what the topic one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do
the features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located
the computer through keep you in touch
as the president he proposed
movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor
libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone
for every people when join a social page get worse grades do to this issue
opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself
take music for example
they should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day
for example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better
these were some of the moods created by the author in the memoir
i made sure my parents were not home when i watched it
a person that come in the library daily want to read that book because that is the type of books that the man likes
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways
in regards to this readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them and avoid conflict by avoiding the material
what if we took you computer away
also they help kids learn if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything then how far are they going to get in life
if children are separated and exclusive to adult material i see no problem in having these items on the shelves
you know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day
let children have a choice in what book they read or the movie they watch
apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely
the libraries for some are the main means for getting books
people think they are private but everything that is uploaded or posted is public
it told us that the main keys were
in the last paragraph she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms
it caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration
first of all i believe if its on the shelf you should be able to get it no matter what your age is
the hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort
is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive
between winter and summer seasons there is a short period called ‘spring’
this allows the student to get full credit for their work
by doing this not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want
there are the reasons to why i think that people should less time on the internet and more outdoors
magazines help people keep up with news
in this day and age flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators
they should not remove the books completely they should just warn people of the language
what will come of our world
first reason why i think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer
for example said i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary
her mother then comes and shares the moment with her
we find certain slurs and lyrics offensive while others not
he grows paddy to give rice to the people
all people have different views about things
another was the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way
the mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy
if the cause is if its offensive then all books should be gone
when you go on the computer the thing people go on is the internet
the area in which the cyclist was in had an enormous effect on him emotionally
there are many different types of books movies magazines and music on the shelves in a library
without computers would not know the important news when needed to or information needed for a specific moment
i do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf to where a kid can grab it
i know that when there is no one around i get scared
children all over the world read books and as time goes on our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels
mood the memoir sets is a warm mood
in this next paragraph i will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries
eight out of ten surveyed by the national nature admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer
this shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives
hills take a bigger toll on a persons body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill
so why would you make that mistake
instead a lot of times when someone down at the computer a snack goes with them
this is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place
do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have
if you believe that it is offensive to you then why are you reading it
also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest
he has a limited water supply and he keeps coming cross ghost towns where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption
take my advice and buy a
censorship in libraries
the computer is defeating that purpose
on our way to the museum he told me stories of the kings and queens of our country
they allow people to contact others who are far away
at peak hours people try to board a bus whether there is any space in it or not
they try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths
many doubts about the computer exist but the computer can surpass all of them
well thus where same opinion i had about the computer
everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship
he came up to places that were worn down and deserted so he knew he was alone if anything happened
they reward him for his good service in festivals
one main effect that see is many people play the computer too long and are becoming overweight
do you have a kid a younger friend or even a younger brother and sister
people sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy nature
it represents the ability to overcome obstacles connection to the past and comfort when needed
also when your bored it will give you something to do
using the computer to go on multiple websites is actually easier
this system helps people find exactly what they are looking for
everyone is different no one is the same
mahatma gandhi is my favorite leader
whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what
first there will be no reason for removing the books from the library unless more new books and etc
there are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library
books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way
they can be religion race or brought up in a different way
they were not cared for and the doctors there had no medicine and instruments
when you read paragraph two and how he describes the home the author makes you feel happy
it gives you a sense of togetherness
the cyclist surrounds did have an affect
technology has been growing and changing rapidly
due to a computer he found the diamond underground beneath the ancient temples
you might need it for typing a paper for school or work and you can use the internet
he plays a very important role
interacting with living people in person
kids around the country are being killed raped and bulled to computers
the sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration
not their choice though
another example is online arguing which can lead up to many problems like fighting when you get back to school
the author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents
i know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things
things such as sports nature riding a bike and many other activities are missed out because of being on a computer all day
on the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid
now you can probably see why i think we need computer and how it can sometime benefit our society
the features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly
it could help someone write a paper to learn about a subject or do some research on a topic
this shows how grateful he is to his parents
if computer are such a helpful source to society why would people consider them as a concern
there are millions of people in the world
this are the reasons why i think that censorship is not right
would you want your children influenced by these findings
these books do contain language that is not appropriate for children
today there are books on almost any topic anybody could dream of
one of which i really need for a homework assignment on the movie
now that you know my personal views about the censorship in libraries understand that not everyone is the same
the mood created by the author in the memoir was very loving thankful and happy
most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie
my friends blew on whistles when i cut the cake
the computers have gone to far now
no need to look and look a hundreds of books just to get one little fact
therefore if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people the cyclist would have found water
libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world
because of site like these
the censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching
computers can also be used for research
without computers students would have it a lot worse
the author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life
i thought everyone was treated by equal rights
with the internet the computer provides the users with websites that enable them to talk to friends watch videos play games and more
i agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents find offensive
if someone comes across information that would be offensive they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is
not read or listen to things that can hurt someones inner feelings
therefore kids will get into trouble for a stupid thing
the cyclist encouraged himself to keep going just to find an open building
now we can go on the computer to find weather the medication is at all dangerous
computers can be very they resourceful at
our library has books almost on all subjects
the kids will see more nature and be bale to learn more about animals
science has changed our domestic life
i had revised my syllabus twice
my first reason why we should keep computers is because it help on school homework or projects
people who spend that much time on the computer miss things
through the computer people are able to send messages to each other
learning how others think too
all you have to do is make a word document and type with the keys
what someone might think is weird somebody else might think is normal
most of the time you not even know who it is your speaking with
by libraries exposing children to derogatory music they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families
she is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower
least death on my team that game
teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book
it was time for school
the common people live in a so called
books magazines music and movies should not be taken off shelves
finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist
so it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it
who trains the air force weighs in on the effects of computers
whenever a teacher need an assignment typed you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day
instant messaging is just like texting on your phone except much faster
owners can now have businesses all over the world
his wife also is a very kind lady
i believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong
although some novels not be appropriate for certain people censorship in libraries is not they way to fix that and it is a big mistake
i think all booksmusicmoviesmagazinesetc
lastly why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker
we can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch movies listen to uncut music
he does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him
it has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people
computers can help us explore far away places that we never go to
like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need
no i know you will notbut think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think
i can always change the radio station if i do not like what i am hearing
books magazines music and movies all relate to peoples likes and dislikes
we would have nothing to read
i believe that computers have a great effect on people because you can keep in touch with family and friends go on school websites and use search engines
nature is beautiful it has green grass rainbows sometimes
that experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well my grandmother
in the memoir the reader expresses the love and gratitude towards his parents
but with the help of my computer i can interact with them all year round
the most apparent is musical instruments
dear the effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society
some kids like listening to music while reading
so we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves
also kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it
the feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph when the author talked about his family
some people are working with stocks and these days the stocks could be good or bad so you need to keep up
our is mainly run on computers without them it would be very difficult to be aware of an on coming attack or threat
and physically she will age which will also teach her new things
the setting affected the cyclist performance
also the feel of his home reflected on the mood
also it helps people do work
the reason why it is so popular paper want to talk to friends that they enjoy talking too
i believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like
in the state of it is proven that of residents are overweight from not exercising and are overweight by not eating properly
people use offensive things all the time but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way
it also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need
they still have good information that someone other than you want to know
the last paragraph said in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
all over the universe people agree or disagree with what i have to say but its your perspective and what you think about it is your choice
he was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback
my second reason is that computers has games kids play
books are here for a reason and they need to stay
i see those books as our history those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up
keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch read or play
why would they take anything off the shelf
and you want to talk to your friends
for example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer parents would they would because your lack of communication with the family
without this technology where would we be
computers are fine in moderation as are most things
but not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination
this gives a loving and caring feeling
i think computers have a positive effect on people
those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist
since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines i think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries
but they took it off the shelves
parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends
also she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table
when he finally arrives at the fish camp he is relieved to be alive is uplifted
most young adults read about books that are about adventure mystery or love
the features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony
it gave me a great deal of information that to this day i use
to whom it concern i think computers have a great effect on people
people all over the world do that just about everyday
they sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches
then in paragraph the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal
you can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from
the setting of the story are very dry and humid and flat and hilly
i learned in class that in the job were much more difficult than they are today because of technology
but there is also the choice of books for research
the heat terrain and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story
local research show that of planning their vocation use the internet
a fresh start with the drivers test
while you like a book i find it offensive
first being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the
the government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you
it is only because the farmer works so hard that we get our food so easily
the setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist
after the sun sets he returns home
people used to read news out of a newspaper on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper
imagine how tough it would be without a computer to rely on when you have no idea how to answer something
in my own personal experiences i have come across magazines books and music that are offensive
no matter how crude a topic be it still be needed by certain individuals
so libraries need more than one copy
let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler
therefore starting a fight
for example the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight
while removing books for reading be going to far things such as movies could go the other direction
most people that use computers use them to talk to friends and other people around the world
being on the computer can even effect your social life
the heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated
as you can see there are more cons than pros when it comes to computers
he ran into snakes and very deserted country
librarians and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not
that is the last reason why computers have positive effects on people
no matter what are you doing you are usually doing more on the than on the
going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things
there are many reasons why i think that those books movies music and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries
imagine a library without any materials that are considered offensive
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways
so honestly it cant be that bad
some censorship is good and a fact of life
you go on the computer
someone who wants to can so do not take that away from the people that want to read
bead all the about computers and you will think but like me
if you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle
the author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment
people need them for communication telephone numbers or facts about anything
additionally people are able to shop online
first reason is that computers help people educate others
in this passage the mood is set to be grateful happy and loving right from the start
the last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it
i love your hair today
i think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries
but then they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read
i feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer
there are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy
a matter of fact computers have a bad effect
some do not believe that is an opinion
the sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she says then i will take that test again she believes in the flowers
we as have the right to freely state our opinions and what we believe
i use it to do homework
many people love computers
i said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things
if all books were rated like movies we would know just what were buying or checking out
they have games that range from the word to beauty barn
soon after that he did not see anything
also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it
they form a healthy part of our diet
the library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day to day basis
dear town paper i would have to pick being for computers
however you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years
that is also why movies have ratings
people need to enjoy their life
there are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society
you can write a visual letter to one of your friends
so yeah you many not be able to get a book at the library but you can almost always find it online
in my opinion everybody should be a part of some physical activity
i think that it benefits us all
once she plans it things start to look up
magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for
getting information has never been so easy
these things are why the mood of the memoir is loving and grateful
actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children
there is noise everywhere
a child or young adult learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials
then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road
those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him
the same should go for a library
not everyone agrees with one another because everyone is unique in his own way
you never what might find out
have you ever read something that you have found offensive upsetting or has made you mad
the mood created by the author is a happy mood
would you censor the
a good suggestion for this is what i just brought up a personal censorship
they can learn from a new point of view
plus sex makes books better
a might be tried of hearing about all of time and might find offensive when a girl compare him to or
like if it has to deal with sex or violence they should be taken off shelves
from learning to chatting computers are a great way to chat with friends and even do homework
but the parents did make it to the united states
the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech
he was an italian inventor
you need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills at the same time
if we do that then all the books would be off the shelf
a soldier is well trained in the use of weapons
if a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child not the shelves
i felt so bad for my cousin he had to watch his mother die all because she used a computer everyday cause that has her job
you can always find a library around there are no
each person has a really good ability that stands out
also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town
computers make our lives easier
what would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read listen to or to watch
computer are all the time
another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be
horse or the mule is yet another animal who helps mankind in more than one way
the features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk
there are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else
magazines and movies are the same way
computers can help everyone connect with anyone you can see computers have so many positive effects on people
because it means so much to us
computers are quite helpful in school research work and other important stuff but there are many bad effects too
this means some people prefer to write than type
censorship on libraries
sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about
the second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it
next reason why computers are bad
some novels more than others have a lot more graphic content such as
the solar system is very big and jupiter is the largest of all planets
here at we have over computers in use throughout the school day
if i had it my way the would not exist
books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything
this aggression cause others to get aggressive in response which lead to a verbal or physical fight which hopefully nobody wants
finally with much strength and determination he reaches a fish a fish camp
if getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well
then it showed me a picture of and the history of the country
if there is a book that you find offensive in a public library i do not think it should be removed
but some tell you what age it is suitable for
the author of that book and other people who enjoyed it do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves
the mood created by the author in the memoir was love
many people believe that computers are positive towards our society
next computers also allow people to learn about other faraway places and people
i believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye
it was her decision to keep reading it
this is shown when she says a blossom of two would have blown into the well it reminds her of her homeland

he wanted to reach there soon
i also went and tried to help her
on festivals like christmas mr david arranges for a gettogether for all the neighbors in the common park
does that make them wrong
it also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves
i think books that have nudity curse words or gang related violence should be put in either a adult shelf or taken off for good
it is just like text messaging only through computers
it is a lovely thing to be perfectly loyal to a friend
i urge people to dump and
for example most teenage girls love to read young romance stories and about young peoples lives people like informational books
being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes
music could also be a bad influence on kids
the powerful words he uses in the last two paragraphs puts the memoir into a mood of love and perhaps even sadness
i make my own choice to not watch or those kinds of materials
two the heat is making him thirsty and is running out of his water

although these are things that our country has overcome there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems
a mother of a student in
whose to judge right and wrong for anyone
online where anyone can go on there are millions of people that are not connected or related
the author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this
if books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now
but to others its does nothing to them
i got really mad when i read it so i threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them
i wish gold gives me golden wings one day which can appear and disappear when i wish

sure it is still okay to surf the web
being social is an important quality in life
it not even be your friend
wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb and the growing realization that i could drop from
this could be a very bad influence
anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion
my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us
for example one person like to read philosophical books and the other like to read romance comedy books
the third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people
the world exposes certain literature to children and then is shocked when they see children in jails gangs and other horrible situations
so many communicating things make computers even better
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
the book has been written so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person that being the author
that is why i think computers have a positive effect on people
my second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature
that is just one example of how the humans mind can change
how this benefits you is because you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them then video chat
however computers benefit society because they life easier now a days
some are single coloured
to make matters worse my favorite uncle dropped in
that would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they cant
do you notice a lot of kids these days want to
computers have been the technological item to have over the past or so years
so as you can see technology benefits our society in a big way
i hope you agree with me
these children act in ways that reflect what they have seen
i conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing using it repeatedly and not exercising is
there you go there are endless possibilities with computers
also to play games on
it really puts a bad influence on everyone
for example was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of
even now there be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one individual editor
people were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the
like spending less time with your family getting addicted and unhealthy
is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting
there are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff and people who want your personal info
i really do not get why you should complain about these things
he is thanking his parents for being brave and coming to with little and creating a foundation for their future life
there are ways mentally and physically
the mood set by the author is very solemn
he is the captain of our cricket team
my reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want
this is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars slavery and politics
i think that music just like movies should not be able to be censored because they are already rated accordingly
first of all we have a right to say read write and watch what we want as long as it is not slandering someone
the in this memoir is joy and happiness
he thinks that some miracle will happen and he will become rich and prosperous
what if you had to do a report and you could only use the internet how would you be able to tell if the information is trustworthy
no it does not because it actually helps us
we will need to redesign buildings to have doors big enough for our bodies to fit through
computers have games for kids that help them learn and also people learn new things too
computer helps the world in many ways
except for one thing that she quickly recognized
instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music
as you can see those are just a few reasons
some good effects some harsh effects
you see alcohol everywhere and kids are doing it at a young age because movies music books etc
the books could be a school assignment
the creator of each song movie song magazine or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer
to help this i type almost all of my papers
i believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back
if they are found offensive and proved offensive they should be moved
without computers our society would not be so far advanced
until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair
that is the mood in the home blueprints of our lives
well with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button
people can do their work in the computer
he does it with love another mood in the article
you can tell a lot about his parents by those two sentences
a parent supposed to help their child grow and learn right from wrong
the last reason i think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures videos document and contacts on your hard time
would we take the classics away
some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything
maybe that person has personal issues
i remember making a with my best friend back when we were in grade
she even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends
do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom
this he had lost hope and hung his head
in the setting the young man is faced by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person
people that act their age should be able to read watch the movie or anything just because they can handle the situation better
many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet
computers allow people video chat and talk online
hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil
finally the computer is great for playing about every game there is that you would feel like playing
i bet you that if you keep reading it would be understandable why i agree
the author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from home the blueprints of our lives
they have dictionary sites history sites encyclopedia sites etc
the feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in do not exceed posted speed limit
millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves
for example computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily
the whole memoir is about love family which sets a positive mood for the reader
other than things that people find offensive
secondly you act enough generation child i go outside basically it all kids
interact with a human being not some graphic designed computer picture
in fact a study that took place from to to see the long lasting terms computer overuse had some shocking results
they are the then now and later of the technical world
another reason i think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet
the romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing
social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past
at the beginning of the ride the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey is just beginning
they are our best friends
everyone has their own meaning of offensive
the cyclist is lost has only found dirty water and is moving on rough ground
the main character said friendship and home is the basis in his life he understand without letting his parents teach him
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story
you can see nature is some thing children need
well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer
at times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies
others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away
they want to do the same thing you do so they copy you
lastly humidity because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is
and get a college education without leaving your home
first of all if a person is eighteen they should have a right to read whatever books they chose because they are grown adults
thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living
crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind
if you find a movie magazine or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it
even when i was young we were taught no cussing aloud and yet you see this all the time in books
the features of the setting affect the cyclist
those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive
these computers can even improve your mood
music is a different story
should not be moved because anybody can be interested in them
some people might say that computers are useless but that is not true
the setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically but mentally as well
so what are you doing readers
books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them
people just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others
i really enjoy learning about foreign places and culture
the computer provides websites giving information on every time you could think of
he works till evening
thirdly they allow people to communicate so go ahead take it away but see what happens when you do
the mood created by the author was grateful and happy
the computer is an easy alternative for communication
is what i thought the author in the memoir mood was
if someone lives to far away and their is something important then the is great
being honest and hardworking are two qualities to have
when the geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning
“the best day to accomplish something is the day before tomorrow”
i think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it
seven years later he was able to send radio signal halfway around the world
my first reason is freedom of speech
the man was very crazy
therefore it is better to have good health
do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content
you can even earn a college degree on the computer
need directions to a restaurant
in paragraph this is where the first introduces the custom of his house
finally computers allow people to learn about different places around the world
that has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults
then why should that person be punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something
everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it
although you are supposed to be at least to have a most kids lie about their age
instead of mailing a letter you are electronically sending it
she looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in
the author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking
he really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill
his parent did the very best they could for their family
but he is not the only person who has become unhealthy because of computers
for me personally and i know many others interaction would be impossible without these modern manuals
to answer the question i agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves
the internet has a much broader range of articles so it is much easier to find information for any topic
therefore to allow books to be read music listened to and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances
intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you
i think it should be up to the reader if they can handle a book or not
we all have seen a rainbow one day or the other
it will help us out so much for everybody future
that is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids
the author concludes the story with the last paragraph
i think most people would agree i say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same
but no matter how you look at it
when have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf
also the whole race the cyclist biggest problem was water
these were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist
next is that you could be outside enjoying nature
computers can be fun and interesting but people are spending to much time on the computer
also do you know it was offensive to them are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book
which will be bring yo my next topic
other people think that the computer is very helpful
i know that some say that there is less time spent humanly interacting but on the computer it is still interacting
with no computers how would you download music to an
people might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something
and well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits
if this is the case i think that its not the right thing to do
i have had personal experience with these kinds of problems
a lot of jobs today require you to use a computer for example working at a bank you use computers all day
also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what hes doing in weather that he could drop from heatstroke
these are three huge advantages than using computers give people
reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like
i believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family
on the other hand the computer can come with much use
some peoples views on that is totally different but hey
people rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people
authors editors photographers and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves
a little while back a magazine took pictures of a girl and tried to expose her this is just wrong
there is no such thing as a perfect world i believe if there was people would go crazy
most people get addicted for the certain things they do online
it is a bright object in the sky
as said above libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds
in conclusion you should buy a computer
who knows maybe you will get a book that makes you think twice about what information is held in between the bindings
the setting in do not posted speed limits affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes
they find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them
what if did not invent the telephone
also it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water
like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor
children are our future because when i am old they will be the ones who are caring for me so for me censorship is big deal for me
with censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book
dear local newspaper it has came to attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad affect on those who use them
they were going to take to a party
i believe that this is definitely true because i remember that the same happened to my sister
how this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them then video chat
life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades
not many people including me would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these
if you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped
i am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries
we should not throw wastes everywhere
secondly there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books music and movies
learning about things you have never dreamed about learning
he finally found hope
the mood of this memoir is nothing but good
in books music movies and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better then something fun
i will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects
what path would you take
not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing
we need computers for so many things and they benefit society
this agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions computers and phones
when the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless
there should not be any style of censorship in the
i take that very offensive because back during the time when black were not able to do certain thing the whites would refer to blacks as monkeys
even though these things are pleasurable you should limit your time on the computer
there have been so many movements over time many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people
computers give you a chance to get your bills paid and do some shopping for a cheaper price
they provide us with entertainment an easy way to interact with people and a huge source of information
there are many places on the internet where you can meet new people
that goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like
and so local newspaper that is why i am writing you this letter today
to eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace
they provide us with a wealth of entertainment enable us to communicate with one another and even help us learn
you can regain a true life back with them
also his family gave up their friends and family good jobs and all said goodbye
he is s stockbroker and operates his whole job from the computer in his house
engineers use programs on the computers to help design what they are going to build
so instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking on the daily news or searching like that
no matter how offensive the topic is
the passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone
that material is the life blood of our society
also lets say your doing a project and you need information instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it
if we start getting rid of all the offensive material many people will be offended that in itself
praying to god is part of all religious practice
it would turn out to be a disaster
they are all happy because they can be together and have a grate time
such as pictures of nature celebrities
he thinks the heat will kill him
this is things like staying in town with someone far away or editing photos
this is because everyone has different views on everything
but guess what they are in the computer wasting time instead of spending time with your family
some people can be happy with things while others disagree
where would we be without those books and authors
you can have conversations with all your friends and family
i remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason
the quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children
lastly working people use the computer for work and reports
some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that
well if there is i would be looking at what they are reading or doing
dear local newspaper back a couple decades ago before computers existed
having to pay to travel
the author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language racial remarks slurs etc
personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun but where does the fun stop
finally computers help use get information
just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back
with that being said children of all ages come into the library all the time and pick all kinds of material
they just keep people away from going outside enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends
were not thinking about what power teens have with the internet
when she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test
most of those people are of age
there are no loud or emphasized parts
in the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area
the mood of this memoir is grateful and content
orange fruits are also imported from other countries
the computer solves this
is often a week where people read all of the books that have been from school libraries
this was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite raise
this in turn helps to keep our minds healthy
life in itself can be an opinion
first of all we have the right to have these kinds of books
offensive materials contain many teaching tools in life that could help out the lives of many people
not everyone believes that certain books are bad and i am one of those thousands of people
this of the should only be entered by an adult or with an adults permission
websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful
those advances have shaped our lives and made everything much easier
so are you going to do about it
many people like different books music movies and magazines
what he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too
afterwards said they felt an improvement in their mood
twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone
i disagree with that
many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students
when people are deciding when to get vacation they go in the internet
people tell me what they believe to be right and i do not agree with them
and sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older
both parties in case are still able to say and express their own opinions
this obsession with online games or is not what internet was made for
every human mind desires the freedom to choose
parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are they should just take the computer away
censorship to most people means much more than the average syllable word
simply because adults do have the right to view these materials
he has two little ears
not only it supply info it also prepare our for the world
with the maps on the computer you can print it out and actually keep it
whenever i have spare time i go to my small garden
we choose that life style for our children so we cant really blame the music and the movies
then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
so what if some expert think people are spending to much time on the computer and not exercising enjoying natures and interacting with family and friends
children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time
it help a little but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily
first it be a book movie or magazine that someone plans on reading and removing an item will let down the customer
it can be and very offensive
for instance when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out
if something is offensive to one person it be because they have a different background
second the computer gives the ability to talk with friends and family
also online games are for and enjoying also
would be much more difficult
if our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone there would simply be no library
for example of the of people who have computers with online access of them spend hours a day on them
last reason is that it tells us that she is and will be doing her best
computers help us with many things but the most important is jobs
this is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research
generally to keep my attention i like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot
his parents were thanked repeatedly by him for their strength and perseverance and taught him that friends and family are very important
have you ever been assigned a report and wait till the last minute to get it started
not many pay attention to nature and instead of talking to friends in the internet why not meet them at the park
in conclusion if there are books music movies or magazines that offend you simply do not check them out
not only that but the life of kids have been threatened and taken by it
the more time we spend using these items the more we oppose the idea of being active
the mood also makes me think of what my mom does for her job
that is completely understandable
if i had found something that i disagreed with i would not read it or just think nothing of it
one person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book
there be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives
the mood created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community careful and courage
this lets people explore the world and do anything
after passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people
another way of preventing water pollution is to build cleaning treatment plants in factories
interpretation of great scriptures classics and literature autobiographies of great men history etc
a lot of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people
you could be improving your coordination and not even know it
the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows you can over come something if you have the will power
you can go on and watch funny videos or go on and on you friends new photo album
computers are big deal in our community
basically the computer and the bad wide web things to do
kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad
music is an outlet for many people
did you lash out or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding
this way there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager
they give up everything they had just so he could have more than his parents did
dear newspaper your life without computers
it was great to have the hot soup as it made me feel warm
you can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about
knowing this how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons
another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer
if you think about all jobs that are happening today also of the computer
this affected him because he got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning
he talks about faith love courage and just the overall niceness of his home and community
is a very happy and grateful mood
computers offer of games for to play
secondly the cyclist started running out of water
a number of children in the are unable to read at their appropriate grade level
one of the informative ways is that you learn new information every time you log on
yes but we need these machines to survive
overall was happy about how his whole childhood when and it seemed like he loved every last minute of it
i think computers definitely have a positive affect on people in many ways
a perfect example is my brother
the author of this memoir put a mood to it
because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side
there they can read about past and current events
this the mood of family
these cards allow the person to have access to adults materials depending on the kind of card the person has
the mother was also able to overcome some obstacles
many people can say they have
information communication and life skills are all important to our human nature
not even books that will influence bad things
this quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty it can do what it takes to survive
one has to work hard and practice for some time to become a good meson
the materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest
technology can teach people things that they do not even know they could do
many business rely on the work of computers entirely
whether we like it or not computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future
she could look to the plant for inspiration
it should be clear that computers are a danger to society
all computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a
well i can children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days
also the benefits of or personal computers are too large and helpful to pass up
but here comes the computer to the rescue
these hills made it hard to go up on a bike considering his lack of water and the heat
slavery is an offensive thing to colored people cause the colored people get called names that i will not say in this essay
you can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework
if i feel i should read books that others find offensive then why does that concern you
you can change anything you want with just a click on your mouse
so in conclusion i think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this
there are books music movies magazines etc
he keeps a small stick in his hand
they assist us in everyday life life and make difficult tasks simple
it also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate
the computer is all about fun you have millions of websites you can go on
you might think they have positive effect yes but they damage your body
numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today
i do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves
let us allow our words to flow freely
home and family is the one thing all of us love
does it just end here and now
one in five children are obese
so i think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or who ever do
first of all the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism
they he is to build skill of typing help and it easy and also help keep and family connected
it be offensive to you but to another person it not be
elephants eat fruits shrubs and grass
thanks for reading bye
everyday more and more people use computers
there are many people who go to my school and their grades have declined because of online usage
even though the right of removing things sounds like a good idea we should consider the thoughts and ideas of others
so you see computers are not that bad
of course her and exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that and she moved on with her life
first i will state why i think the books or movies or whatever should be taken off the shelf
for all you know the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer
and other people should not get offended by what other like
in conclusion computers are wonderful machines
for example a computer helps you study for a test with information websites like
i do not believe that books music movies or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive
teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family
lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic
what if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it
second we need computers to do research for school and work
in they had to start their lives over entirely taking whatever work they could find
just want to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town
the librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library and have the kids book in the younger section of the library
i remember when my friend would go home change eat and log right inside the computer
he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table
of all the places taking things off of the library shelves is not going to do justice of what really needs to be done
maybe its politics it could be a sports team
that is the mood the memoir set of me to understand it
in a recent poll out of people say that computers had made them more social
all throughout the memoir he talked about how his parents love of him had them leave their countries and come to the us
for example their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers

electricity helps to light up the streets at night
everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right
now singers are starting to make music videos which not along sings these lyrics but shows them as well
for our generation and for the many generations to follow
society was different then
why bore yourself to death with computers that will probably give you the wrong advise when you could always ask a friend for advise
when games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue
the inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible
but the big question is can people find everything they desire at their local library
basically the author did a full circle by ending the story in this way
it turns out to be not only his last hope for water but an abandoned grape juice factory
and even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present
experts are awed that over the years computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before
whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents
the one thing parents especially that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability
ultimately consumes all free time
most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not
not everyone can go to big so it is easier for them to use an online college
more over it will bring more danger to you and your family
censorship just be a big word to most people but it carries a big problem
dear newspaper people should play with their family and friends instead of staying on the computer all the time
being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important
the rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them
one way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out

his mother was a chemical

everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others
lets find out what i have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people
she started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage
man must know his foundation and where he comes from
finally in paragraph the author explains how he learned the true definition of family
the reason i say this is because if you are on the computer your life is passing by you
first off computers help technology so much
the cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey
in the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture
also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are
censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to
libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things
a recent study showed that of kids would rather be bullied in face then over the internet
i would have to say to chat with friends
also computers can make things easier like typing
it is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving
however to even be eligible for the third card you have to be eighteen or older
it is not right to hide the truth
she feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her
no need to worry you can just type that paper up on the computer
i told them i have as much rights too have those books on the shelve as they have to have their books on the shelves
you cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes
if we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library there would be nothing left
even though i feel this way about inappropriate books i understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship
i believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines
when all their time is devoted to to computers if they took out the computers in their lives they would have of time to do such
i would rather the world be an educated place with minor dangers then a place where everything is kept secret and safe
those are my reasons now let me explain them
the person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material
the audience is different therefore the types of literature music movies etc
when people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got
dear people owner either computers or laptops
computers really help the elderly out a lot
these two opinions can cause an intriguing argument
in fact the real life situation would seem to be more offensive
we also learn how music evolves from one thing to another kind of creating off of itself
this is a great thing for everyone
fresh air is very important for plants and animals too
the author in the memoir tried to create a specific mood
kids today need to be able to read what they want to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life
i think that the author concludes the story like that because be shes saying that by that time shell be ready to take the test again
the fact that there was nothing around him made the author lose hope and trust
if we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive we would not have religion or modern science
that one should never give up
if people were to read books very often there would not be enough to do anything else
some mystery books have parts in them that be offensive
did you know that a computer teacher in life say if you need to use a computer in your will one already
and being fat also has a negative effect
when i was young i would always want to be read to and when i continued to age i would always read
you can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores
you can talk to people without the expensive phone bill
they want to look perfect
in addition if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library then another man or woman would believe they had the same power
if you believe so then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics
in other words the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
teenagers as well as adults need to communicate through computers
the features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist
if a book is removed from the library for its contents people will look into as to why it was removed
another big target for censorship in some countries is the
if they did have one then you have you did it in minutes but how else could you contact them
children can also read or listen about gun violence
one other way to speak to others more for business reason is
i can tell u who wants to do that
the organisers have given their love to those homeless children
the temperature was so hot the cyclist said he felt dehydrated
you also learn more thing about place any thing
over the last thousands and thousands of years media has grown at an incredible rate through books music movies and magazines
his parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person
using computers is good for the body as well as the mind
our body is a wonderful creation of god
staring at a computer screen for a long amount of time will not keep you fit or in shape
offensive books should be there to only distract the teenager from school
how do computers though help us with work
this quote says it all if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive
so you mostly spend about or as fix it
here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems
censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today
the mood created by the author in this memoir is happy and loving
or what if someone else had the choice to
with the advent of social media we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard and people are listening
i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
i will also explain how the past has an effect on present day
everyone can be offended by something so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left
everyone was in a hurry
we should be permitted to say anything we want even though in our hearts we should know what is right and wrong
i thought that computers are very helpful
after two hours we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant peanut shade
we can chat with our friends which is very useful
there are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends
computers effect people in so positive ways
the heat made it hard to keep riding
little kids books about kittens
taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers
people spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change
if were to refrain from listening when being spoken to it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker
his parents wanted to help their children and give them better lives
computers then come in handy
not being violent or cursing after everything you say is not going to hurt anyone
starting at a young age
they want to hear the bad language and see graphic gory scenes
in conclusion there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed caring mood
thank you for your time in reading this letter
it lead him through more barren lands
you use computers to write play games look at pictures and print work out
because of the computer hard task can be done with a simple click of the mouse
my second reason would be education
many children get their acts from books movies and magazines but most get their acts from something different
movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time
it could only get worse
this can cause great tension or sorrow in families
so when she goes to take the test it will be a year
he then shows up at a ghost town
you can be able to type well and very fast after a while and improve your eye sight by reading your writing or notes for a paper
now i regret not getting together with her to hang out
parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library
they could try suicide
first of all without computers many people would struggle
with computers you can create documents pictures and even movies that will stay on your computer forever
and they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on
the worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water
people should really think about having computers
computers can the history of place not us
often i look to other artists works for inspiration and the one place to get that music is you guessed it the library
although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you
another feature has it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it
to me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended
well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why i think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf
the author has many moods in the memoir
he had people at his house for dinners
which are good for young children of age five through six
to block any part of this experience to block our full potential
i think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them
the geese symbolize her new life they have become almost familiar to her now the obstacle she faces is passing the driving test
last you can shop on the computer
in my life there have been numerous obstacles which i have had to persevere through
video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest
he works very hard but his pay is less
at electronic stores computer games are sold
i say happy because the author was happy to enjoy having so many friends and family to come over everyday and have fun
i met many of my friends and relatives with whom i exchanged pleasantries and information about the families
another thing that affected him would be the road condition where there were tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake
i feel that the people at the library are lazy personally
i think that would be unfair to do that
or even just for fun or to learn something new that you never knew before
whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library
it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
the fun messages are what makes everything so great
would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think
when he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time
it says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home
one reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people
their are many mood set by the author of this memoir
thank you for your time
computers help us communicate in many ways
censorship of books is not fine but censorship of movies and magazines are acceptable
a library is a family place not a fun zone for adults
a computer has made the life of a school student so much easier
he created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate
they build fantastic hand eye coordination and help with many things including sports
this are three reason a think that
the three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling the towns he passes and the availability of water
that we do not believe should be on the market it is likely that we would have no media anymore
they are harmless and can be seen everywhere
if one removes these from society in any form then at a raw standpoint they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society
there is one count that one situation where i feel censorship is necessary
they can go on the internet and get information on with just a couple clicks of the mouse
books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them
this shows instead of buying games online your buying seeds to help the environment
they both came to the and had to work in whatever job they could find although they deserved much better ones
there is another reason why people go to the library
school sites are available for students of some studying or help
i suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it
there are some good ones out there if u look
sets a mood of gratefulness as well when describes how much is parents sacrificed for him to grow up well
even doctors are computers your medical needs and give time
the area that i would be most concerned with would be the young adult section
does make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone
children need books to provide an escape to expand their imaginations and to help them in school and life
computers also help with instructions on how to make things
but if you open it up what to do you find
dear computers do have positive effects but the negative effects are much worse than the positive effects
so then you play more and get addicted
because or she does not agree with the views expressed
but i have and i also use to read them
get off your computer and go for a walk
despite the racism going on in the places around them his parents were able to bring people together by being welcoming helpful and friendly
he was wet and i gave him a towel to wipe himself
when it comes to things like this there is a huge range of topics
people might not get what certain materials want you to do but they get offended and tell someone about it
the last reason why i think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use it for entertainment
in letter i will explain
since then he was also called the enlightened one
so turn off your computer get off your couch and enjoy your life
they can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong
lastly would be how his parents cared for him
an elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had
he states in the story the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
if another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same
dear newspaper i am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people
not only do the alternatives that i stated before keep people safe they also practice a healthier way of living
she thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again and when the hibiscus begins to bud
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion
music is a whole story its self
a heat stroke can be fatal to anyone especially those with heart problems
the book did not have any benefit to but because of that book i received an a on the research paper
knew that he would get punished but he decided that grounding would be better than injury or even death
another reason why is that you get to meet people
you have to mete fun
it is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong
he held the boy tight and swam to safety
books are cultural objects and our minds are molded by the books we read
dear some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time
everyone is cheering you on
it was on a and my mother was just about to have a baby
movies can be offensive because of the language violence the way people are treated
second when he ran out of water
computers are needed in this day and age or else some people would not be able to survive without them
i am writing this article about using the computer more than an hour
the computer to most people i know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones
educational benefits will only increase as technology so cutting children from it now is a big mistake
clearly the computer provides ample ways to research and learn on a daily basis
the specialist advised him complete rest
please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment
with very little water
this could effect peoples education and reading skills
this continues lots of kids will be fit and
they say they are keeping children inside doing nothing but really they are helping us so much
he preached his doctrine to the people all over india
your sight is very important to living
not to fear super duper computer is here
we wrapped ourselves in warm clothes and set in front of the fire
certain books magazines music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library
i believe that these materials should not be found in libraries
a survey done by the showed that of between ages are overweight because of their computer use
there are so many things that effect our opinions
i always feel nervous before the examinations
as i believe any human would be
the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist
next the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to because the geese sound familiar
the people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away
so if everything is changing around you why do you want to be stick in the past
google is not the only search engine on the internet there is also etc
mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive
the rest of the would be for people to study and read
when we have any problem books give us the correct advice
that effected me because when i heard it i went around people who were positive in my life saying it to them
i also think students rely on computers to do work too
do you have out of state family you wish to talk to
family activities is a nice fun and enjoyable way to spend your time
either way it would help them be a success in their life
i do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that
plus you can find a safe home with it
the terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition
the setting affected the cyclist greatly
a common side effect of dehydration is hallucination which the cyclist knew
computers are common by now but people argue rather they are really needed on our society
and they can teach us new things
finally we are able to talk online with people that just be across town or across the ocean
the setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp
besides who is to say what is right for everyone
these features of the setting had to affect the cyclist
this is why i think having a computer is a good things what do you think
the mood is described as joyous giddy excited and elated
i think every should be like this it would help make the world a better place
i remember going to the library when i was a kid and i wanted to check out a movie
everyone should have a choice and a right to see or to see certain material they might find offensive
the fact that i can read about other peoples life and their everyday struggle is astounding to me
and what we read in the magazines have a big affect

this question could be answered in two very different opinions

for example she said that in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she would take the test over
some people not find this offensive
these websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily
after i wake up i wish my parents
while i was in middle school every day i would have a book with me to read
in the computers have help man kinds
the army men play a very important role in our lives as they protect our country
every person black white yellow brown or even green has the right to freedom of space
it only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs
music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around
from hard cold text one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit
they can take massive amounts of energy to climb
so now you know that a computer can teach you things
do they have a good effect or bad effect
her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home
when your on the computer you can even meet new friends and have conversations with them
especially growing kids and teens
she still feels the same way still to this day
and these setting could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay
have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers
we can not escape the diversity in which we live in
the cyclist also had a really bad time because he had to taste stones in order to make his thirst go away one example of that is when
the features of no buildings no people and no cars affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water
the authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents
the other things you can figure it out on your own
should i be allowed to remove it from shelves leaving teenagers without their music denying artists freedom of speech and ultimately leaving them unemployed
if people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints
for example the text states when they come back in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding
it tells us what the opinions were of people at that time
everything is normal again and we go to check out
and learn about new things everyday
the student might get frustrated and would not know what to do and would have to get most to all of their research off the
these computers are crazy expensive
they learn from us and our generation
for me i like to learn a bout crocodiles in
the plants she grew up with exist in the as well

about the same time the bus reached my stop

and maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here comfortable enough to try her driving test again
take to a for instance back in that time it was common for black people to talk slang and common for men to curse when mad

i also play the game with my friends in the neighborhood
statistics show that of all children who are permitted to talk with friends out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades
the features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons
materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive
the moment of breakdown was as she got the flower
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something
on the other hand it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent
between the and doctors saw nearly a increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery glasses or contacts
dear local newspaper i feel that computers are very useful to society
i would do it on the computers if i miss it
i can understand why some people want to remove some movies or books from the libraries
that way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive
children should be protected from such material and book banning provides this service
the computer to me is very beneficial
if you needed to know some thing for a big report and none of your friends are up you can look up your computer
they also need adult combinations to preview the movie
people would not stand for it
your computer will come up with hundreds of different ways to make a chicken for dinner
the terrain was tough just like the authors terrain
i once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology
soon you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life
that is why i am no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves
families sometimes move far away from their families and friends so they want to keep in contact
also they wanted a better education for their children so they left family friends everything behind so they could restart their life
books are part of history no book should be censored
people think that magazines are very important to the society
think of a climber trying to grab a on a mountain
in conclusion computers are a necessity to our living
i love to spend time with my friends and family
even a child interactions chatting with friends on or anything could be said
this is not of all good especially since person needs at least hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being
what would our forefathers think of what censorship has become
there is a chance to move on there is hope
the sun is shining the birds are chirping and a lazy breeze is flowing through the trees
do we have the right to take books
no i strongly disagree
but how is this possible with some people going to work everyday and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day
have you ever wanted to know what the capital of is or what the weather is in
in the last paragraph the author explains that home is were he learned the real definition of family and love
because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt anger and determination later on during the day
there were many shops in a row
people’s hobbies differ very much according to the character of the person himself
now you ask what about the little kids
another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them of ten
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
this is called censorship
this can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right as well let them be aware of what life is about
computers are not only great for academic purposes but also for leisure purposes
he can jump high across a fence and run very fast
think about how someone really likes that
each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child
the author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story
the second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions
to that i said well can i still use the computers there to get information
same way with the media
if a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it
some middle school through college the rest of you life need to use computers
schools are using computers more and more now
think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the in the first place
in no way shape or form is this morally correct
the mood in the story was very nice
her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy
i believe there should not be any censorship in libraries
so my answer is no about taking things away that are not censored
some say that you should just use a phone but you could use video chat on the internet
it gives audience to our thoughts and we are linked with the super intellect
the computers we use in society do not harm us in any way
people sue messaging to connect with their friends family other people they not know
it makes the reader think of their family and their culture and what and who they grow up with
my mom keeps the books and managers many things for a company
some of the towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated
i could go on and on the list is a mile long
there is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country
i am different and kind of an outcast
it all just depends on the family
you might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends
some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves
kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library
but are all the libraries meeting their requirements
we need to leave every book on the shelves
i do believe that certain media should be displayed in confidential locations
also the things we read everyday are what make us who we are so there in fact should not be less books but more
statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the
usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age and up
he had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up
all the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly
the author was affected in many ways be the conclusion
i think that computers are good
this shows that there were always people around
in conclusion computers have an effect on people
you can learn about any subject on a computer at anytime
i think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship
trees give us fruits for food and flowers for pleasure
the sun was shining and a cool breeze was blowing
the dry bland and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey
he sells fruits in the market
in conclusion computers help in all different ways
dear newspaper people
my hold opinion on computers is
they think that children are the gifts of god
there are more than six billion people in the world
computers have a large effect on people
do you ever forget what your homework was or what time does something start and end

learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday
its also because there is very little water left for him
just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read
the mood created by the author in the memoir was in a very thankful mood
they use this to try and see more magazines
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story
sometimes you need the computer to do your homework
computers are a good way to talk to friends that you not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time
he checks it out and goes home to watch the movie
into a computer to add beats and different vocals
you can find information fast
the mood that is created by the author is joy
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes
the first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful
children can find out the password and net around
said who destroys a good book kills reason itself
movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content
in fact the percentage of people that have computer is much greeter than the percentage of people that do not only you exercising for yourself
if you have ever been to a movie theater you know they have certain ratings
i hope i made you all realize what a computer is really for
my mother blessed me
we also saw monkeys chimpanzees and apes
that is way nothing should be censored
when you get out of college people let go of some good friends because they could live in different state
everyone has the right to have their own opinion
this is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader
my last reason is that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people but they have books for that too
it is also not another persons right to decide what other people can and cannot observe
dear editor computers have a good effect on humans
certain literature provides a cornucopia of topics and subjects to be helpful to a processing brain
many say that ignorance is bliss but is it really when people impose their ideas on others
public libraries are a far different story
i support computers because they help with writing locking up information and provide communication
its imperative that the community takes action to stop this from happening
when someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people
children are very curious
the other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it
how many schools have books that have racism in it
there have been a couple of times where i have walked in a library where i found a couple of books that was offensive towards me

books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up
there are thousands of libraries throughout the world
more over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds
since people are so dependent on computers sometimes working form one can hurt your vision
the answer for me is no since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness
by making it attractive a bookfair creates an awareness in those who don’t read habitually
everywhere in the no matter where you are there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you
where it starts to add up
you could take any famous work and someone could be offended it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs
i feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives
the mood created by the author in the memoir is love
computers have without a doubt had a positive effect on people
that leads us to the next big topic health
how do they learn from computers
but it seemed that she realized how the plant was able to bud to the odds and survive
people have a right to read listen to and watch what they feel is good for them
do you really want to write it all
this young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes
and think about how much computers have done for you
when you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around
like i said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer i mean how would we communicate or do our work
this place was completely deserted and there was no water for him
social skills are the difference between success and failure
please let them keep teaching
it is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book
then there is the distance of his ride
two computers are good for you in many ways
should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not
yes having a computer is helpful
computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper
it was a lovely experience
as long as no laws are being broken there should be no problem
that is a question that i have yet to find the solution to
it also showed the importance of your loved ones and how you need them in your life
i believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing
get off that computer it is
the parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away
this is why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test
plus they can talk to other people
did you know is a program were you can look at your grades and missing assignments
local middle school teacher uses computers to teach her students about the culture and geography
students are smarter than many people give them credit for
parent blockers can only do so much
the author thanks his parents for their kind and loving actions
the internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane train boat ticket
so please the local newspaper please try to make this believable
no it should not be removed
just stay away from it and you will not get offended
many of the books i choose are relatable to reality which often involves content that be considered explicit
i hope you read this with my regards
would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication
i assure them that i understand those feelings
computers and almost everyday
the internet you can watch videos an almost any website you go on
i would like to say computers are not interacting with family friends nature or anything of that sort
also if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer
it makes things that would other wise take lots of time very quick giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside
that my give you a virus
people need to enjoy the wonders of nature instead of sitting on a computer
well its not banning books music etc
there are many ways you can exercise
please read on about how we will go computer dead
dear editor computers are becoming more and more prevalent in the
things do need a little censorship
online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework
with a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question
exploring the internet is what a computer can do
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
dear local newspaper i think people using a computer has a effect
you could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever
as well as for research school use computers to type papers
slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse
i feel that censorship in libraries is not needed
mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do
while being offended by a book is bad we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that
there are somethings kids just should not see
when a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it
why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun
picture if you will a hard working business man who lives in the
without computers this disease would be stopped
in take home and watch
do i believe that certain materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive
but then are people who disagree with them
the culprits had taken to their heels when the lady raised the alarm
if anything it will take away happiness in the world
if individuals find the material offensive they should turn their back and not read or watch the programs
some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco such as its good for you to try
young children need books to help their imagination grow
the man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle he began to get very thirsty
some pieces of work are just too offensive and they need to be taken off the shelves
my first reason i think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs
when you go to the various sections of your local library what section do you start sprinting towards
someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them
with all of the new devices we have people can just get their books online
the computer is also helpful for research papers
they sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind
if there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things
it can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe be wrong
he works hard as a student
there are always going to be offensive books and movies out there
of course every parent wants to protect their child but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices
another example is if there was a shooting nearby
this made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him
it can come from the parents their friends teachers anybody
these games start off fun but they become habits
you just stare at the screen which is not good for your eyes
he hit a bump and swallowed the stone
many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright
this final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea
such as our right to freedom of expression
you can search any topic and learn more about it
most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information
things like that should not be in a public library
however not all individuals support censorship because of their children
the only place you can find a giraffe is if you go on the computer and search a giraffe
the flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring
most importantly if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate
games make us disciplined in thinking and in actions
censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions
that is what i think the mood created by the author was
this quote shows that the narrator has realized that even though aspects of how life has changed some things remain same
not because was gay but because had never told me
having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers readers listeners etc
also the snake affected the cyclist
for these following reasons people stop exercising and being fit
readers please try avoiding you computers for just one week and you can forget those jet plane
it could help gain knowledge meet new people or make you gain weight and have a lack of social skills
i think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test
the cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does
staying in touch with family and friends having a good education and finding answers within a click is the easiest way to go
at this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation
if we decided to allow this would there even be books movies music or even magazines for us
the author is giving a message not to give up
having great coordination would mean that person would exceed past anybody who do not use computers
not one person has the same morals or values as another
then monkeys and elephants showed different feats of skill
would we get as much knowledge as we have
sometimes it is just not enough children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age
that sounds pretty simple to me
for example in the story it says over one long crippling hill a building came into view
what if article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas
what things are found in libraries
a world without books
not only does it make things awkward but it sends out the wrong message
imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another
why should they take them off the shelves
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
people are different in many ways
computers internet access our business would crumble then the economy would follow
these conditions directly affect the cyclist
everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book
it is very hard to become addicted to the
couple that with him biking and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert
instead of finding the birth date of she found a book making fun of and calling them inappropriate names
sports prides its self on that
i think that movies and magazines should be censured to kids at the library
third i believe its a good way to just relax
computers help us with daily things and make many tasks like writing an essay much easier
what is offensive in libraries
also all my friends are on the computer and some them are more active then me
if you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary
with computers everything is easier
people believe in different things
thirdly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places
you can contact the people there with computers
all over the world young kids young adults and adults are reading books magazines listening to music and watching movies
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
also if you have family in a faraway place you will be able to look online and see what is happening there
this is when you have a webcam and you can see and talk to other people
so we decided to go to the zoo
there are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful
we should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too
should this movie be taken of the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs
she plans on passing her driving test come spring no matter what
people all judge things differently
trees occupy an important place in the life of man
some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it
they are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer
to them death is not a big deal
for example in seventh grade i moved from to
no i do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive
i read that book when i was
that can easily offend a person but those are brilliant pieces of work
and do nothing except the computer
libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste
this was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry plus the author was riding his bike making himself more thirsty and hot
this can bring you closer to the people you love and help them get to know you a little better
there is no need to over react to words on paper
computer are also helpful for applying for like you can look for you like
all the electronics these days are making people forget about nature and that needs to change
for example if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write on email
a world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions but hundreds of years of war love and hate
and that goes for about in
dear you think computers are bad for society
these are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as and even email
and also have you ever needed to get information fast
the things kids see they soon try out
in conclusion if you find a movie song book article or magazine that is offensive to you get over it
well i can i have and know they need and it benefits them
the level increased dramatically and so have the high pressure level
thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility
how could they allow this kind of thing on display like this
it would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools
if the ball crosses the boundary line the game is started again
i believe that computers have good effects on people
it could be typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure either way they both require a computer
the scene was frightening and i had no courage to get inside the train at all
he works hard to earn his bread
in every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste
people find entertainment to movies with sexual or violent activity in them
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
all of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his
books magazines music and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive
being in shape talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go
do you think they are good for us or do we need less computers
this is a fabulous point on why computers are so important
a policeman also controls crowds
with this you can play many fun while learning about interesting facts about science
some people have one because they like to look at pictures
one of them jumped into the pool
our country say that everyone has the right to free speech
if you say something to the parrot it listens to it carefully and learns it well soon
authors write or type every word for a reason whether happy or sad or vulgar
it helps people to learn about others and information about them
just think about what our world our knowledge our society would be like if we did not have these precious things
he returned to india and took part in the indian freedom movementtruth and nonviolence were his great weapons
there was one time when i went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research
are we not a for the people by the people
really is this what our lives should be focused on
final reason is because the interact influences violence
dear local newspaper i think computers are great sources
at the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information
no opinion or view is right or wrong
for example my teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters
first the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more which makes ones body use more energy
one life skill you can learn is how to type
lastly in paragraph he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills
in conclusion the setting played a major role in the story
for other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers
i feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable
music does not kill people
when are finished telling you why these three reason are good the peoples computer will win this war
also the little kids has to small of ear to hear and also to small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that
next he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him
if you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories
it was there choice to pick it up and read it
everywhere one goes something is being kept from them
if a person want to read something they should be allowed
computers are able to help them with this
this denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple our own expression
this goes from kids to adults
they would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers
my attentions for letting him read it are for all the right reasons
as we all know obesity is a factor in the and around the world
many things can affect the cyclist
that candy could have been the guest favorite
what if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up
there are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below
a post office is a very important place
i believe that computers benefit society
some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages
and if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed
like almost everything out there the internet could be used for good or for harm
if the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to removed asap
i decided to call my friends cell phone but instead i got her voicemail
people read material to entertain themselves and there is nothing wrong with entertainment
the author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty marvels of nature
there are just to many people in this world and i have read articles about libraries
to begin computers help you learn new things
that is what the narrator choose to end the story that way
i spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project
he looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch
the eldest son is a spoilt child
these people are not alone
regardless of the language this book used it shows a part of history
you can also learn ahead far away places with a computer
fire” i got up and saw our neighbor’s house on fire
in everyone eats spicy food
for example chat rooms can reach up to hundreds of people
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and fortunate
computers help people learn about foreign places
i think computers definitely have a positive effect on people
that is why you should agree with me that we
people can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language
should you take control and get rid of it
he can feel angry happy sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death
the unemployed are required to register with these
while the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland
next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs
another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness
how are we suppose to teach history without telling the whole story
this is one of my reasons why computers effect people in a bad way
dear local newspaper are several reason how computers have effect on people
last offensive materials have impacted society for ages
when we go to for a vacation i help my grandmother to water the plants
some people do not have a computer home
as i mentioned earlier so many fights happen through computer communications
without them we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate
also in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey he saw a poisonous snake
others find the book movie or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting
all of those computer related things would not there for there were no computer
libraries can contain very offensive things that can make a person sick to their stomachs
computers have a very strong effect on people
there are positive things about the computer and as well as negative things
one day it was raining hard and i had nothing to do so i went on my computer and played minesweeper
library is also filled to capacity during lunch hour
bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the because people are not interested in nature anymore
they do whatever time they have left they chat with friends
the issue to with is do you think that people are spending to much time on the computer or not
finally there would be nothing left in the libraries
the setting in which is cyclist is riding can help or hurt the cyclist
obviously nothing is overwhelming
our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides
they had to find new jobs and give their child a happy life
the two friends go to the sea and get on to a ship
things like teaching them how to cook how to treat others and the real meaning of family
when it comes down to it most books movies and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways
honestly it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book
when you are on a team and exercising you will learn life skills
we had comfortable seats near the windows
computers are a very good thing for kids to have
not allowing anyone under to check out explicit materials would also help
would you really try to prevent your child friends and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day
well i think after reading this those extra will be persuaded
these are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone
his destination fills him with relief and pride knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey
this saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade
being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas such as family friends and school
the problem i think is people not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it mean
so why would we allow this book to be in the library
they love and protect their young ones
i love going on the computer time to time doing many things i have talked about
with the help of the internet i can do
the meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader
what would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you
so get off those computers and call a friend
another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
i think this conflict represents the way of life in itself
in the ramzan season they go to the mosque to pray
never being able to thank your parents enough for giving you that chance to live a happy life is also part of the mood
we forget if ‘hopes are dups fears may be biars’ moreover defeat should not disappoint us
computers are useful but we cannot over use it
yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings
i modeled after her likes and dislikes
dear local newspaper i hear you are whether or not computers have a positive effect on people
adding to his weakness and the extreme heat he also ran out of water causing him to become dehydrated
whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is you game a computer will suit you
if i had a story to tell and i spent a long time working on it
lastly computers help the communicate with one another
the cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip
everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read
i believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need
you would not be able to do it by memory you would need facts
communication every where is fast and easy with the computer
everyone the same rights and if the first offended person uses them to bring down then the right to do the exact same thing
they are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time
censoring that book would basically tell the population that they are wrong
hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers
those people wrote the books movies magazines and music so it should be expressed the way they wanted it to be
as citizens we have the right to free speech
also books should be more readily available
i agree that people should not spend so much time on computer
dear of you know that eight out of ten homes in have at least one computer if not more
this is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world
this would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing
we have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not
also you will become cranky and want do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so into your computer screen
instead they could be going outside or even study
this is the mood expressed in the memoir
also he is grateful for how they always made him safe
the books that i think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language violence and bullying
i have read many books that have inappropriate words in them
the features of the setting of do not exceed posted speed limit greatly impact the cyclist in a negative way
instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food
computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car
as you can see computers can help students with projects etc
recently i was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for a process that would take a human weeks
if a book has a few curse words oh well tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad
books music movies magazines etc
books are good for people
also sometimes computers can take over peoples lives
on any of those sites you interact with people
people seem to always look for a shortcut including myself
for people who find books movies music or magazines at the library offensive simply do not use them
she made me sit in the second row
in the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private
this is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist
they can keep in touch by using webcam and etc
there have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past
i believe if they put the books movies and other stuff on the shelf than it should be able to be read by children and others
it can also allow people to communicate online with others
if a parent does this to their child it just sheltering them from the world around them
you can communicate with them through or both
throughout the excerpt it shows his gratefulness towards his life living with his family his life in his home and his overall life living in
again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear
in every book of every library their is something that people most likely think should be censored
if you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things well welcome to life
kids spend to much time on online games
it is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news they report the whole truth
as simple as it is you do it or do not
computers are not worth your children at
i also think that there are some cons
the cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more
we can learn many things about the countries and also the sportsmen and women we meet
out of people have gotten in big trouble through the
my second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying
my third and final reason why advance in tech
the setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally
books are pieces of art
they are extremely dangerous for our health
finally the ghost towns
offensive material could also be learning material
can i ever forget this incident
sure they might be on hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school meals and activities
secondly they give us the ability to learn and communicate with the far away places
the author of the memoir creates a very loving peaceful and happy mood in the story
i have reason it build skills fast information and fun
here he begins to lose hope and is disappointed when he seem the town he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory
then it started to get hot and he was out of water
in pursuance of a hobby one can enjoy one’s leisure and learn at the same time
i think you should put all you support in the problem
so that shows that the computer can be fun but also dangerous
overall my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished
sitting in front of a computer does nothing for your body
if you ask me i think that is a positive effect computers have
it should be remembered that it is the responsibility to censor materials for their children
so he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside
as a student at i have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments
computers have a positive effect on people
so get out there and change now
most of the time a child will read what looks interesting and fun
the reason why i think computers are good is because people like to do their work or children likes the games on the computers
in many schools students ask their friend a question about homework
outside of school there is so much more to learn
the parent was no where to be seen nor heard who leaves their child in a book section like that
with computers we can online research save trees and communicate with people far away
she is talking about the hibiscus and the geese
computers are very fun
the have different website that play video of things that are funny
but if people had the right to remove books or anything that is offensive towards them then there would literally be no books left in the libraries
the cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all
another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are
also it is important for children to get fresh air
i believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned form their childrenbut not from the public
these subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst
it gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home in her new home
the computer supplies pictures sounds and interactive activities that really help kids out
entire companies revolve around computers and if computers just ended people would lose their jobs
lastly computers have had negative effect on society because of money
computers are for people
throughout this memoir the author creates moods whether good or bad of the memories of his childhood
the main way of online communication is or
i think that after a certain age people should be aloud to read whatever they want
like afternoons or during lunch time
computers do have an effect on people
my second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because
but you just can not for get about those books you have to watch what they are reading
more people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone
having a computer could make you have draw perspective of everything
birdie and i have become real good friends
a different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story
they can even make there own side of the libraries with just censored things for adults only
people needs computers to look for a job
computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things
in all of these websites you can keep up with whats going on with your friends and whats new around the world
also questions that have been asked can now be answered
remove no books from a shelf and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they be interested in
therefore the ending of the story displays the themes
when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding
in everyday life there are things that are said in movies music and magazines that kids should never watch hear or read
for them to see or hear
well those are my suggestions to you
the uses computers to locate where they will attack or defend
now music and movies etc
the author concludes the story with this because she really cared the hibiscus
i think that if you look deep down into what it to say how you will understand why we need to do healthier
he also has a lot of respect for his parents
by concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test
one way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life
when the geese get back
well that problem can be solved very simply get on a computer
has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book
another thing is you can research countries towns and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books
another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason
we can only learn from their mistakes
the cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him
from reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person
the ostrich defends itself from enemies by kicking
animals have been here way be for us
you have any interaction websites
i you to consider my ideas
people should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are
should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries
firstly it allows them to type
i feel so sorry for having sometimes made faces at her
i learned to get my voice heard i needed to do it in an appropriate manner
a piece of music movie or magazine
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
libraries should only have history math and educational books
i get on the internet but not for video games
sometimes the cat spends hours and hours at the ratholes in searching of tats
should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive
many students are in the habit of reaching school late
there are lots of books about freedom fighters warriors kings etc
firstly they help people find information
i have observations experience and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions
they can be seen selling their eatables and tempting the hungry disgruntled people
and they will always try to fight and say that artist like and are not suited for their
you ca share photos videos games just about anything
children need to be protected from materials that hurt them in some way
the mood is created by a description of the kindness of his neighbors
friends family start to know who you are less because you can see emotion through a computer
does this mean anything to you
there is really no comparison
my friend was having so much fun on the computer he forget to do his homework
you would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape
i see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music
i believe this is a great thing
in my experience i know that when i was to young to understand the happenings of my parents intercepted the stories from me
there are really three main reasons
computer games distract from kids learning
most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports
the cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke
i agree that computers have a positive effect
music also helps you look into your creativity which means you want to do more things such as dance sing or some even start to paint
you have to be yourself at the end of the day
these things offend people every day
it is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same
moderate censorship is acceptable for the young but there is a line even though it is hard to find sometimes
our state does put in each year for our parks just so we can ignore them
more people make a website that allows us to easily keep up with our distant family
some books music movies magazines etc
this is difficult because he states the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips
computers can help in many ways
the final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world
the author has spent so long cycling through heat his brains starting to shut down

taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read
the same thing applies in a store
and computers can make our live s a little easier
there were a number of airplanes at the airport
that still does not make it right to remove what i or others like because it offends another person
we know this was the case for the cyclist because he says but not before i gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth
i sure would and i think most other people would as well
i use the computer to talk to them basically have
hate sites that encourage terrorism racial violence and drug use are all over the web
to add one final thing would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word
especially when i had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in
north courier i would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers
it is the best thing to research with
this was making him dehydrated
but should those materials be removed from the library
i was little i rarely ever went on the computer
my father bought me few picture postcards and my mother also shopped a bit
we should not give anything to those beggars who are healthy but they don’t want to
it also set the mood of the era and the place where the story is being held
magazines are also used for different things such as comics housework as for ladies makeup perfume etc
a poem novel or even a short story these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf
the sea helps all forms of life on earth
does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because one is offended
if you want to talk to your friends why not call them or more modernly text them
muddy water flowed along the drains into our garden
love is all around this house
the possibility of heatstroke came to mind
there is books that teach you a lot
yes due to the fact that some books are a little above others age of reading
thank you for reading my ideas editor
this could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they become violent or depressed
books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people
but mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still
friends always find something fresh to admire and appreciate each other
people know their limits and if they know the contents then they should stay away
i went to my friends houses and listed to explicit music and watched rated movies
we need and because of the realize ever a screen
the reader feels a sense of comfort
the plant signifies her memories
it was a very good story
finally the temperature whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist
there are over i information sites on the computer
we should have a say to what is in our public library
in fact in just began using these games as part of their training this
to many people other than myself would agree with that
he started of determined then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated
for instance you spend less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
the feeling in this article when it talks about family is love peace happiness and gratefulness
even though there is racism one is friends
but without this device what would they be able to do
that is how the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist
doing when was easy you will also get a better grade
now for my third reason
what i considered their aloofness was just discipline
who are we to fault the people of the and for how that articulate words
a young boy jumped into the house and took out the crying child
people would rather sit at a computer for hours doing wonders of our world
censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression
she let herself by the flower and remember her home
he even at one point felt that he might die
first the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like
in a different area of the library
the setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay
also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more
have you ever read a book you thought was offense
reason ties in perfectly with the first
hey some people even work from home
have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living
both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers
but also you can play a lot of different games and also type on an notepad
he is a hardworking man
geese fly south for the winter to stay warm
in my opinion we do not need computers
we look different and see things different
now everyone knows his name and listens to his music
one reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of
lead to civil war between the northern states and the southern states
and they older what then what they say
i think certain things that people find offensive are only offensive to those kind of people
even though you are ill you will still be getting paid because you are still working
if offensive material was banned from libraries our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world
some kids have their education online or to teach others
what if the library is closed if you do go then you wasted some time
she was alone living with her husband who was not well and confined to bed
i think they should overlook it
however there is no better website with all your friends on it
one of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it
he is a useful servant
i disagree with this act and i would like to tell you why i do
many features of the setting affected the cyclist in rough road ahead
this would mainly be because you would only have one point of view the point of view that is perfect for everybody
the choice of what material you read should be left up to you not restricted by what someone else finds offensive
they only become offensive when people think they are
when you listen to music it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from
she is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful
this is a big part of teenager life
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding
if someone dose not agree to what another person is reading they don have to be there
this is good for those who are busy and travel a lot
also having this access to friends can help when one moves away
in conclusion i think everyone that likes to look up places play games and chat should have a computer
throughout the story he mentions the lack of water
i believe that agrees
try to memorize the schedule
but materials be removed if it is sexual racist or life threatening offense
try to prevent all these negative effects by limiting the use of your computer
this is why computers have a positive effect on people and everyone should have a computer
one of the many times i went to the library i was looking for a book i had read before but i could not find it
one is the bad weather
there is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed
on another note a survey shows that of children that spend time with there family and less than minutes on the computer have grades higher than in all classes
i believe that materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children if they are found offensive
there was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel
also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain
in the end it all boils down to freedom
i can tell that he is inspired by them
some are about subjects we love and could read about for days
dear newspaper company more and more people use computers each day
finally stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers
with more advanced computers and technology there can be more special effects and move violence added to movies easier
in conclusion computers have outstanding effects on people
what we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so
dear people use computer all over the world for one reason or another but they are very necessary in our world
next it is easy way to make friends from other towns
recently i read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they online
i think these should be a limit on a computer so people spend less time on the computer and more exercising
sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age
if that book like that was censored it would be like saying some people are better than others
thanks for reading them and have a nice day
for example my cousin used to be an outgoing friend person
please listen or your child could stay back
another reason i do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is not everyone is offended by the same thing
people who stay on computers day waste precious time could be spent with family exercising or finding a true love
the features of the setting including vast emptiness hills heat and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in do not exceed posted speed limit
a person who shows a foolish and carefree attitude towards life is often nicknamed “a butterfly”
with computers that number goes down into the thousands
they were able to endure their hard times with the faith that this struggle would help lead themselves and their children into better times
the features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist
dear i believe computers are a huge benefit to society
this is because of all the friends family and celebration
so these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book
in my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors and anybody else who was involved in writing those books
the mood of the memoir by is love and compassion for his parents
computers give easy to the internet which has so much information it is
budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework and go on the computer is also very important
the people who find it offensive have the right to not look at it
i remember when i was about our phone broke in our house
any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage
i left her a voicemail and called her house phone instead the same thing bad happened
if books were censored literature would have an immediate downfall
first there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library
saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance
the mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented
imagine the impact if the had locked away every copy of the because it brought about change and controversy
the can take videos and pictures as well as play music videos and games
books videos art does not harm people
she has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought
i say those people are
they should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point
another advantage is that when your on the computer you can chat with people through webcams
learning and studying new and important things
each person is different and people have all sorts of opinions on books movies magazines music etc
many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language
so this brings to my final that computers are a bad influence on human and we should use less of them and for ourselves by doing not seeing
one of those freedoms is the freedom of speech
obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common and its because young people are glued to their computer screens
if you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me your wrong
he finally got to the next town to live
you might be able to see how an household runs
the cyclist makes this statement
what is a government for
in a computer you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources
it would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive because almost everyone is offended by something
one have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives
many people a days work at home they have their own office
computers have caused problems where kids do not do any types of physical activity which deprives them of their daily needed exercise
a computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination
at the sight of all these flowers memories flood back to her memories that bring her joy and sadness
the plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad
is the computer getting in your way
as a i doubt you say that research is a negative affect on school kids
whose to say what is appropriate for whom
what do i have first block
while working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer
way to meet and interact with new and interesting people
the holidays are fun
the hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and and it is a thing of beauty
to whom it i have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern day computers have on society
computers make it simple to learn new information about many things such as people and places across the globe
why try to block out negative things when there all around you
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found a flower that reminds her of homeland
the average person goes on the ten times a just to get information
this had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right
with this being said should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive
without it our family would not be able to function
products in a library are for anyone to view not to judge
everyone has a different view on something that is what started this issue in the first place
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive
magazines are not really a problem
when the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself
have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching
many people in use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things
this proves that he is grateful
it really does work on your hand and eye coordination
another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information
i believe that computers are beneficial
and where does eating that music need to go
as a high school student i would research the topic about offensive material
another time that i would say to use your computer is when doing some work projects or homework
reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them
now i realize how bad that was towards colored people so i behave nicely to them
it could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey
students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed so they feel the need to do things to become noticed
did you ever need to know something about another place or maybe want to see your baby cousin who is not a baby anymore
the computer takes time away from nature
he bears a good character
he laughs at the irony
she tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end she will be prepared
some teachers take some food or tea
the books were created to provide people kids especially with facts that no one else could share and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge
he wears the school uniform when he is on duty
and use the computer only when you need to
some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers
computers help you learn and research which is faster than going to the library and getting a book
i think that there could be some things adults can read and some things kids can read
my house has three bedrooms and a drawingcumdining room
i say get read of it all and do everyone a favor
another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper just a click away
i think that people are spending a lot of time on there computers and not enjoying nature and things
the teachers sit in the staff room
in one leg and he hobbles when he walks
it was a great experience for me
of course i can be talking about anything but what about computers verses family friends nature your own health etc
no one can blame the authors
now we have computers we should use it
but if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from
to censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities destroy our profitable media and be unconstitutional
there are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness
best friend is and all of his cousins live in
with computers you store all and files neatly
although they were sad i also felt that they were happy
our founding fathers creating amendments for the people
i think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person
we should not result to that
in people over the age of nine have an email
if you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent
no one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust
they read them at school and get them somehow from their friends
there are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people
books music movies and magazines are sold for this purpose
there should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at
they enjoy simple dress and adorn their houses with necessary furniture
when he finally found the fish camp he was relieved
we were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport
if everybody at took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away we would be left with no books to read
if you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they need those kinds of books for
they help education make everything and traveling is
dear i am a child of the tech generation or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning
however is not the only person who agrees
try and see if you can find the first ancestor of your family
read the title before you pick up the book
many people ponder if computers are really beneficial
so the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map
also because they had to leave their lives back at home and start all over again
one example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing
also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing
in south africa he worked to improve the condition of indians living there
and weight problems are not the only thing computer to worry about
to conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves
we are all unique in our own ways
the only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back
the world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place
the computer is beneficial and has a positive affect on society
censorship is either loved or hated its all one big opinion
childhood is really the golden period of one’s life
every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain
she spends a lot time on the computer whether she likes it or not
they called her she because she took the blame for her father walking out of her life
just as i would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book
overall the negative outcomes of censorship outweigh the positive outcomes
should books music movies magazines etc
to me that sounds crazy
everyone sees things differently
is now a size fourteen in waist
the carpenter’s job is not easy
children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did
also some things could be offensive to some people that could be critical to research for others
if people think some kind of music is offensive then they should not listen to it
in conclusion these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist
for someone who is quickly running out of water this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue
you can talk with friends listen to music play games or do all three at the same time
milk is used for making tea and coffee
when a person has an opinion they have the right to voice it anyway they want
so get right up and decide
censorship has changed a lot
i am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world because computers help everyone in their education
those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers
this is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health safety and education
because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated
from the authors tone it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist
it is still making them learn some thing
or at least your children have
many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer but is that really such a good thing
there is a certain extant for movies and magazines
these are my three reasons why computers are important to society
by being able to search anything help children with homework and pass the time if you have nothing to do
unable to bear the smoke i moved away fast
so say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display
whenever i saw his face i knew that everything was okay
my friends the answer is nothing
i will never forget how my parents turned this house into a home
a good half an hour later dad comes through the door with close behind
dear local newspaper you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people
his mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change
and physically by becoming dehydrated
if people think they are getting rid of the offensive books magazines etc
everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries
it would lower its popularity
in conclusion you need to get a computer
i was still a nobody
last they even have the ability to locate missing people
in school now many projects are assigned meaning we need the computer and internet
this was a really good way to end the story because it sets a positive vibe
hes also running low on waterthe water bottles only contained few tantalizing sips
also you can use the computers for a research project or you can use the for some facts on people like and
most people with books figure out early what genre of books which authors and how long of books they like
lets say that you need to look something up the thing you always go to for information is a computer
we should keep music out so people like me who have been inspired can inspire others
computers a very much talked about subject
whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that
a horror film is not suitable for a of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on
i know from personal experiences that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people
when you have sex you have to make sure you are safe
well i believe that having computers around are good because
you can get research about the earth and what happens to it
the kids can just grow up the way that they should
they sprayed water on the house
computers could also hep us find more efficient way
everything can be saved to a laptop
hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people
in conclusion the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
i soon became depressed
maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored
my school has a big and spacious building
it gives people a good education
so now because of our computers i could catch up on the work that i missed that day of school
she looks and researches it
they be offensive but they teach us many things
the extreme heat just makes everything worse
computers help people communicate with other people
who spends the most on unhealthy food
it builds the tone and mood of the story or character
the narrator is explaining what courage it took for his parents to make such an adjustment for the sake of his own happiness
i acknowledge that i should get outside and meet up with my friends but sometimes when its raining or snowing i just want to talk to them online
if we allow this right then these libraries which allow individuality would not be able to exist
my misery came to an end
there is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store
to just take a book off the shelf just because one person or a small amount of people think that one book is offensive to them
secondly it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends
when i use a computer i am not addicted
many things that involve settings can affect other things
as you can even see computers are a necessity
so putting materials off of shelves is not the answer
hard works are of great quality
only adults could watch
temperature terrain directions all gave the cyclist doubt
one out of every teens spends more time telling people on the computer then face to face
in my opinion computers are a thing for our everyday lives
dear computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people
this is much like how our libraries are becoming
the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed
when you go to a new country you also get the opportunity to meet new people
books should not be taken off the shelves in a at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner
all these movies and books though are great because they are different and free
growing up as a kid i loved being able to go to the library it helped to enhance my vocabulary spelling and which i learned plenty new words
lastly there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers
in my opinion i think the computer does benefit society in many ways
i believe that books movies and magazines should not be removed from the shelf and that they are there for a genuine purpose
people always doubted him and never gave his music a chance
offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images videos or bad words that should not be use for everybody to hear or see
you missed out on a lot
while your at it plant some flowers in your garden
of people nowadays have at least one maybe two computers in their household
my brother’s name is oliver
many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school
get up get active and go outside
i always keep sending words wrong
if you find something to be offensive all that you have to do is not check the book or other material out
a lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today
censoring can have good and bad qualities
i think that a library should be a nice quiet welcoming
there is no way of making everyone completely satisfied but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved
they might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up
if anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people
this does not exempt writers or artist who occasionally or more than occasionally include explicit content in their works
computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people
many people do not realize this but at many libraries there are sections specified for teenagers
i also read every single one of books
the books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well
most do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active
it can smell any danger
so the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting
he thinks it sounds amazing to drink
do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves
that way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass because it will remind her of being home
they also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently
also music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion
people should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner
we all need to enjoy nature more
people should learn how to deal with different struggles in life
another great application is note taking that can easily be typed
media is all about someones free expression and trying to share it with the world
computers today are much different from computers back then
computers can help with countless things
so i think it depends on the situation
whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project we all use computers
it will not give you a job or school education
we can avoid road accidents if we obey traffic rules
this need for the computer can be bad
critics think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family
she does this to show that she still has hope and wont just give up
the offensive things should be taken off the shelves
even nature suffered from the advent of computers
i do realize the library has age limits on rentals but what about all these posters everywhere
computers can also help people learn in many ways
there are many of them books also
everybody should have they own section for their age group
first computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy
the mood created is happiness pride
the last feature would be the distance
they have fried their brain from using the computer to much
if you go on in you could find hundreds of on one topic
in my opinion censorship in libraries whether by government or other civilians should be allowed
for example a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her it could be a predator
even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer
we cannot deprive children of that
censorship in libraries should not be mandated
letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly
in a normal society learning leads to questioning
now if books stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent there can be charges pressed
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
if we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries
the computer also allows you to talk with people far away
someone might need a certain book for a project
one reason is that people can chat with one another
if every thing went by one mans rule of what to and not to read we would down grade as a country and
the mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring and it shows appreciation to the authors parents
next computer can help set up activities
since he ran out of water because of the heat his energy is also dropped
the basis of the authors life has been the lessons that his parents have shown him with their lives
and there is nothing that can stop people from talking
god has created men and women
i feel the exact same way and someone should put a stop to this
finally they spend less and less time with their family and being active
a third reason is that they end up offending some people by removing a book
the more you chat on chat room to strangers the less you will talk to your family
books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we have never thought about before
also its beneficial that everyone has thing to do but computers are the best thing to do
but their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff
should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive choice is no
being who i am there should never be any offensive books movies and magazine in a local library
some be fond of other genres and some dislike the other genres
his neighborhood was united and hardworking
it was a play boy bunny magazine
dear play a big role in our world today
if i found something that was offensive to me i would just ignore it
there were times of racism and violence
for instance in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations
i remember this one time i entered a contest and the i needed was lost then i remembered i put it in my computer
i guess it all depends on your view of the situation
although technology namely computers can be a wonderful thing we need to look at the downside
well if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public there nothing would be left
i reason that computers are more unhealthy for us
if we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist
even a scientist can not know everything
the author is a woman
the government pays for the books that are purchased into the library
he also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were
the situations in this novel are ones that could be real
in conclusion i believe that is we are bad for society
so yes take them away
in this memoir the mood created by the author is mostly happiness and celebration
next you can find information about everyday life
they let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes
this was must end now
he is saying all the things he is thankful for
i think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn
after the first chapter i had wondered who who call this a children book
you can also keep in touch with friends
computers also allow students to email teachers in case missed classes and assignments
second it helps us connect with and meet new friends
will be the ones and all that important stuff
people should be outside jogging or working out and enjoying nature
honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight
anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement
computers have helped us write essays more efficiently complete research assignments
it is the same idea with a book or magazine
i think many parents would agree with my opinion and stand by it
there are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it
every person is different with varying ideas
that is why you should have computers all the time
once the store has lost customers they lose money then they might even lose their store
but again goes back to the will power or the want to to go back and do the test a second time
these game can past time and the player some fun
the spring is a season where everything is fresh and new
in my opinion people should use the computers but not a lot
traveling is such a without a computer with out it you have to go to to buy tickets
websites like and are most commonly used
in the there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say
it shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy
on page he says i could drop from heatstroke meaning hes starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen
you can learn so much about him like where he was born how family relatives did he have and more
this genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes
computers were made to get your tasks done quicker and easier
one section for kids one section for teenagers one section for adults and one section for middle aged people
however teachers say that ever since was invented the students grades were skyrocketing
they practice it freely which is sadly not the case for others in different countries
you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test
this is my third reason why children should not we spending more time on computers
do research or maybe just for fun play games
then he cycled along the desert which was very hot
authors have the right to write whatever they want
teachers say the same thing too
as my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses
i think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things
it brings a happy mood
they can cause an addiction and create numerous distractions
books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning
please continue on to learn about how we should use the computer
even if your just happens in you can keep in touch through email
whether its listening to music playing games or talking with friends you will always have fun on the computer
in conclusion i think that computers have a positive effect on people
secondly many kids and teens are attached to their laptop and bring it everywhere with them
but you find that you are starting to click when you meet this person they be of a different rare
other material could be a fiction story filled with action horror or love
you also have friends page to see how you are doing
we must ask what are we missing
that is one reason computers are bad
on a computer you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states
it brings to the surface the evil side of human nature
books that are bad should be taken off the shelf
a lot of the parents do not want there kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive
in the story road ahead exceed posted speed limit the rider runs into a large highway sign jumped out at me it read rough road
was reminding his dad about it all
i understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages but i do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves
my concern is for the children who get a hold of these books
leaving options open for students is the best idea because more kids actually read
a library is a place for people of all ages it should not be limited to just one age group
the mood in this memoir is very strong
this is my first reason why i think computers have a positive effect on people
information put them in order and give them to us when we need them
also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move
it is hot dry and deserted this out effects the main character and journey
at night the teacher reads his books and prepares new lessons
computers can help people with schoolwork communication and entertain you in a safe way
this is just ridiculous
it gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad
kids always follow what they hear or what they see
online people can communicate with others
dad said the reason she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago
when it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about
we want to keep your children away from the bad things
in conclusion i answer this question by saying no
in conclusion i had agree on the statement and my reasons why was because you wont have fun
the neighbours say that this boy had killed a large number
we come in contact with other people traveling
i think that the great outdoors is the way to go because needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer
anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free rather than paying for it themselves
entertainment is everywhere on the internet
many of these books have images of how do this and that
the cyclist took his advice he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast
they would teach you how to type and take some lesson on typing without looking on the keyboard
magazines these days are even worse
click on these and information that is needed is displayed
your computer can also a lot more things
the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons
i much rather see kids outside playing
there are even movies that are like those books
when a book is inappropriate for the reader then it should not be on the shelves of the library
the public is open for anybody to read a book
i strongly believe that they have bad effects on people
for people who have relatives or even good friends who live quite a distance a computer is what you
instructors report that skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past
well you can be done with the hours of looking if you just use a computer then you can get outside and play games
these advances in the technology are making us very selfish
through ideas such as this you are not only taking knowledge but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation
where do we draw the line
your culture is a part of the mood of the story
if people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies
sometime you can feel a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and the way thing are going
as you can tell without computers out hand eye coordination
i think that computers are good thing to have around
they wear dirty and shabby clothes
in in my opinion i think computers have helped our society over the years but other people think differently
the when they came back quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself
we all wore nice party dresses
we have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do
censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such
can you picture person in your town blind and having glasses or even going to the
do you like learning about faraway exotic land and animals
it will show that a large part of the earth is covered with seas
however censorship can go to far
seen during the day time only
they treated me as an outsider
that right in the quote that is feeling grateful
they can relate to all different kinds of people
did you know that of all teenage suicides are from being bullied online
thirdly people are using all there money on those computers
this is showing that the terrain is opposing him
for example is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life were they fight in a war
movies are a whole other issue in itself
the way computers make you feel is not enjoyable
sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with
so when he tries to memorize a part of the he cannot retain what he has been reading
i believe that people should enjoy nature more than computes
read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic
if we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they include a few controversial things we are violating there natural right
so give them time limits
also in this memoir the mood is shown by gratefulness by the line i will always be grateful to my parents
now is the time to stop using computers
online we can research almost everything in the world
and search information in just a couple of clicks
an achievement technology and science that improve all our lives
there is over a million websites to go to
they can go find a different one
located in paragraph
many libraries possess on their shelves books and magazines and even music containing explicit material and how could you avoid it
we could not do anything without our dear mother
but what if there was computer
computers can help you get a better education no matter what your age
if more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue
books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like
think about this maybe you should just have your kid under control and watch what they read
this would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event
if you want to start dating again you can always start online
i have people who stay up for our their paper
this tells how the narrator is thankful
like have sections for young kids then teens and then adults
also money will always be less when computers come along
the mood creates is that where you find the good in a life where there might not be too much good
plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids
there are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages
also we can not forget about freedom of the press
this is because most teens sit inside watching or going on the internet instead of being active
censorship is healthy for children but restricting in adults
soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt and she will return to take her test and will be determined to pass
he wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless
the books and movies are also split into genres into which each movie and book belongs in
also you cant understand what there saying half the time
second you can spend a lot more time with your family
at my public library citizens of my city can request certain books movies music or magazines to be put on the shelves
the author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph
i mean you can do new exercise train for dance competition or learn new magic tricks for you magic show
i believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book a real book
there are various reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people
the water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips
after the breakfast i go to the bus stop to catch my school bus
dear local newspaper i would like to speak upon the topic of the effects that computers have on people
the author states gaining elevation while loosing hope
everyone has a right to read it at some point in time
therefore with such positive affects should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done
it was six in the evening and cold winds were blowing strongly outside
this is a huge problem
your friends are going to start pulling away from you
they should have a section just for those movies
he creates this by telling the about how his family took everybody in
the mood of this story is happy in the author really shows how much of the love their parents and what they did for them
he also says some of the people who became depressed start thinking of suicide
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
she shows determination because she declares she will take that test again and seems to have more confidence in herself
the home lived in had many happy memories and instilled that family and friends were important no matter what
not only are they helpful but they are necessary and i hope your agree with me
for me computer games expanded drawing
in truth by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left
most girls are in the stage where they are maturing still immature but working their way up the scale
i hope it all makes sense about how i feel and how i think about things
would be in the dark
i believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by oneit is not deemed offensive by all
in the sixth grade i learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system
although some people will not agree
it not be the best choice because movies rated let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of
the author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across
since my schedule is so busy after school
the information i want is the facts that really happened or took place
my final reason i think computers are bad is because instead of computer time it should be reading time
so next time you have to research something try reaching for the keyboard of the bookshelf
the books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday
computers have of folders and programs to store information you need
why the librarians put restrictions on the sites
it helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano
you would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again
they become friendly with the seamen and go on fishing
i think this because yes people do play the computer to much but they can also learn a lot of things
we have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries
if there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library
cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter
if there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future
in the end of the story they say that she will take the test over again in the spring when the geese come back from the winter fly
but using electricity is the start
you could be out there getting to were your relatives live to see them
i hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier allow students to do better in and are a great learning tool
we never thought something like that would happen it did
come to find out the water tastes like battery acid
if not why was it made
kidnappings are caused because to much information on the internet do you want that for your child
setting standards on computers can improve this problems and help exercising
take in order of what i have said goodnight
this is one of the many perks of owning a computer
although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring
people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time
it is more effective just to go to a local or to work out
people stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons
dear the people use the internet
he is the only son of our family
books have gotten out of hand as well
the people who do not find it offensive might actually want to read them
he gets early in the morning
this lowers your ability to do on the test
they give people the ability to learn information faraway places and people
then i was able to check a book out
that book would be taken away from all schools in the brings us to this problem
they help students do there school work
download a free language learning app
with the heat lack of water ghost towns and tough terrains made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome
he ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip
losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed harming the future outcome of our society
if there were rules or guidelines that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future
some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life
at that age children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article
i have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference
dear local newspaper you know how long you go on the computer for
libraries should not censor them
firstly computers are mandatory to have for work and
as a teenager i let those words pass by me
books have pictures or they even be poem books
its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer
weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
although they is struggling but they are have happiness
the features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally
even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people
the author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted show how the flower gave the little girl strength
i think that both these opinions are correct
when the kids are grown they decide for themselves food to eat
since the time children are in grade school they learn typing on a keyboard
then the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student
those are the only bad things about computers
did you know that libraries contain books movies music magazines etc
we enjoyed the fair and returned home
people depend on computers too much it can backfire and cause a problem for you
three examples show that family is the most important thing
another reason why i love computer are because when i have to write a project i can just type it
for example your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water
people should get to choice what they want to read or watch without others taking it away from them
all this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud
whether those reasons be personal or professional it rather important
i remind you that computers benefit many jobs in and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know
with reluctance she agreed and stayed at home
someone can be good looking smart or confident
one of the things that affect him during the story is that it was a very hot sun scorching day
my brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made
i mean every time you hit that on switch you and the computer become attached
so removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea
also explains how grateful was to his parents for their love and sacrifice
people grow up fast when you think about it and people start to eat drink sometimes sleep at the computer
many people depend on computers
they shared food shared their homes and shared happiness between them
lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online
my third reason is finding out things
in conclusion these are only a few ways that computers effects people
not only are there websites
censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea
you also read about new subjects and learn new things on computers possibly helping you in your classes or
rap is all about who am i going to sleep with next and how many times i can have sex
dear it has come to my attention that more and more people use computer but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society
their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer
so take a part contact your local newspaper today
face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do
censorship is a two sided question
you could send emails to your cousin half way across the world
computers can be very helpful when comes to student school work
computers have videos that show you how to play sports and enjoy them as much as you do in real life
your going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day
one example was in paragraph
eventually there would be no books left
if kids are more careful online and spend more time outside than on the computer there would be less controversy
there will be nothing left in the store
light instrumental music was being played
yet look at all of the advantages to a computer
the mood the author created in the memoir is united caring loving and more
which effects him because hes beginning to loose hope and thinks hes not going to make it
millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day
magazines are also a small portion of this conflict
computers are good and everyone should have one
if something causes someone else harm we should not do it
dear i believe computers have a positive effect on people
i believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic but great impact
not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate which does happen to the cyclist in the essay
but if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job
everyday people are being digitally sucked in
by keeping the harsh language i feel as if people realize how much harder times were
the benefits of our computers are they connect us the spread news and they make every day objects work
these hot conditions made the cyclist very hot tired and very thirsty
now for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job
we sure need computer to look up information these days
one time my mom had just bought a new computer and i stayed up all night on the internet
i once has to drive hours to see my grandma in
depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read listen to or watch
i believe this because computers provide us with communication skills
in love he shows that his parents immigrated mostly to give his children a better future
no registration to get a library card
but distracting games that waste time also cause stress which could be fatal
also most younger kids that go there are always with an adult
if they can be at home on the computer for hours then they probably can hang out in real life
over in the book section there are and
in cities like tokyo it is only at this time that the roads are not crowded
when inappropriate material is inside a child might innocently read into or see something they are not supposed to
it has golden fur on
do you want your child to have fun
i think will help her do better on the test
the books that they would get rid of would be because of the children
libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre but a young child not be aware
i think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read
they are just not old enough or mature to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines
the cyclist states i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state rough road ahead
they can work on their homework read a book or do some studying for school
it makes bones so stronger and gives us energy
these are all things people enjoy doing on a computer
the computer gives us all the things we need
and it is more and quicker
in addition the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist
everyone cannot be the same it just would not work
how could a railway be worked without order
you can learn also things on the computer
generally most libraries are quite large and organized into various sections throughout the building
he carries a stick and whistle in his hand
people live in all parts of the world and those that are lucky get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country
million of information is found on the internet
the lorries buses cars and other vehicles passed on the way
therefore i believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone we would not have a media
if libraries censored information then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased
the world is revolving around electronics
who knows what you can learn
from the flower shop to the house she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it
for example people that have businesses they are going to need computers
since he was in the desert there was no escape from the sun
some people think that offensive books should be off the selves but some other people think that this should not be allowed
so it can stay without water and food for many days
i shall never forget it
well rap music is based on their past and how their life is
computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature
in conclusion libraries have been around for ever
its all in perspective
event though they are almost adults
when my aunt bought a computer for the first time she complained about massive headaches that kept returning
there are so many books in the world about any topic you can imagine
this however does not mean that it should be removed from shelves
my hobby has helped me to take great interest in history and geography
the town he first saw could give him water but it was all run down and weakened
he sends me pictures of his college friends and any fun places that he goes
libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material
censorship of music and movies is not right either
with just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home
if interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked
it is the same with the health and functions at our bodies
the features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist
the other day my friends and i wanted to go see a new movie that just came out
i hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers
we also eat cereals in the form of popcorn
nature can be spared
the setting had a huge affect on the cyclist
computers are a great way to use in communication
this should also include books music movies magazines and any other form of entertainment
the author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful
in my opinion people would be better off without them
the things authors talk about in their books and what they include no should read
second of all the mood of the author is appreciation
this website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on
it is nothing against public libraries it is just the material inside of them
my mother would not let me read the books when i was younger
so these are just some of the reasons i think computers could be bad
they turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go
from my point of view time is a big thing
note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz
in my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays
one day her time will come for her to bloom
but he always helps the needy persons
he believed that family is everyone that you love and are close to not just blood relatives
some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things
taking away things does not mean your just taking away from one it means your taking away from everyone
there are thousands of books in libraries now a days some are from years ago
they say you are involved with what you read
if someone finds it offensive they should simply not read it
there is no way to see this but one thing you enjoy maybe be offensive to others
adults need them for their jobs like sending emails or typing a proposal
there are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun
dear have you been sent a photo of a year old child with no clothes on
and it was not just those who were related to you but also those who cared for you
they need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books
in conclusion i think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive
disagree with me that is alright but have you ever stopped to think about issues like this
dear newspaper the world that we live in today is full of technology
my teacher said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by on computer and internet research projects
over of people today have a computer
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
i have named her birdie
they allow you to see places
the author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic
she feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable
now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today
books give us the inspiration to do great things
computers for example are in the eyes of most people fast easy and fun but they also pose as a problem
however some experts believe that people spend to much time on computers and that people are not as active or healthy because of it and
you can also learn about people and their cultures
perfect day to go out and get active right
what is going to happen to all of the sports in the world
computers though not only cause safety issues but health issues also
so the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude
i mean if i ever thought i could not be mature enough to read a certain book
for example i am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying
here are statements on why i believe this
efficiency is another powerful time –saver
after being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat sleep and go to work or school
computers are very needed all around the world
computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say
if it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf
a hobby removes the dullness of man
so far in the news there have been reports of suicide of the teenager life reports like girls killing themselves because lack of
some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive
the past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past
these things can influence children very intensely
computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work
so can we come to an agreement life
this is what i think should happen to books in a library
this includes all forms of media excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people
you need to think this way
removing this items would just be a total chaos
on a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration
first of all the people worshipped the goddess in the kali temple
well all of these websites are free
he carries the letters in his bag
she also disliked her new home
i was eleven years old
if to some people some information is offensive to others it might not
the internet a marvelous created years ago
computers are great tools and a great piece of modern technology
your friend that moved away you can send her a message and get back in touch
library censorship everyone has their favorite book
when i tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery acid
now says this about his house because his parents were always so up beat and caring that they showed him what love is
the time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not
some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self
this is one reason the computer is a good source
of kids said that when they are doing a project the best thing to use would be the internet
when you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one
if people begin to censor libraries surely they will begin to censor the internet and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window
when students need information on a school project they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library
computers are also great for communication if you have relatives far away in another state or even country you can easily talk to them through
parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast and yet they allow sexual crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries
a little later he comes across fish camp he is very relieved and thankful to the owners
in the story the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting
the breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down
you can learn about all this and more if read on
also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person
there were times when tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake
if a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction
people can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like
in the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist
my second reason is if you have a computer you can look up questions that you would have
but not the land has changed and the directions were wrong
the libraries that are offering these magazines for rental should restrict children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals found in these magazines
some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings
it is a very simple concept
we use search engines for everything everyday
he hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned rundown factory
lastly you can see pictures of your family
all projects require research
also deserts are hot
would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries
in fact i believe that doing so would create more problems for people
the electricity that runs computers of this radiation
she gets up to go start the car but hey eye catches on the computer
it would not be fair or right to remove books from the library
for example this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus representing her new home and the old together in harmony
after all i am the parent right
so parents please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer
the reason that i think computers people to learn about new
do you want to relax and do something fun after
he is cooperative and considerate
he said that this was hard for them but he found a positive way to look at the situation
giving strangers you information they can trace you down and find the street you live on
at home school or even at work and yes it is offensive and no there is nothing you can do to stop it
dear everywhere you look technology is being exercised and it is beneficial to many aspects in our lives
what i think kids should watch or read are movies and books
it makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who i am
personally i have never found a book song or movie to be offensive to me
when they need to be working on their they get distracted and start to go and their own thing
most of that time can be used to exercise
this activity what they monitor lets you at everyday since he comes home and plays on the computer and more time exercising
the flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test
plants and replant them in the field
it shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands
dear local newspaper i agree with the experts in people staying on the computer to much
now imagine if computers faded away
the game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done
kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to
you are the mother or father of a young child and you take them to the library
if your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways
all of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide
new styles they make more money they make
newspaper i feel that the use of computers is no big deal
i believe if a child comes home with a book movies etc
many people before us went through everyday life without them
also his mood is from the music
secondly anyone can post information on a website therefore it can be inaccurate
none the less there is more entertainment open to everyone
would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends
so that throw that concern out or the window you work have to worry about that
however as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things
the terrain during the cyclists journey greatly affects him
he regained hope and moved ahead
for example or twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school
it’s popularity gives it immense power in molding public opinion
the weather becomes pleasant and cool on a rainy day
this also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail which costs money unlike email
many things in the setting affect the cyclist
the hills also put a damper on his spirits which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going
in addition another reason is computers occasionally get viruses
this gives off a very happy and cheerful mood
a way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf
contact with people from another street town state country can be established by the use of social networking sites such as
the brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision
the most widely used machine is the computer
in some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed
by spending all day on the computer you will get fat lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life
in order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself
maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is
dear opinion about computers is good
in the memoir the author creates many moods with in it
the owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not
some people can and some people cant
so if they get in trouble outta class then why do would you teach it or even say it
an effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the ridiculously large snake he had seen
first of all computers are a big source of knowledge
i am sure most of the things you have to type for are written using a computer
incredibly unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone
when you go on the computer you learn that skill
but i would also like to comment something about the computer
parents should be happy that their teenager is reading and not playing video games or out with friends
computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places people etc
what might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another
a great way to learn about other states
he went in drank cool water and then on used his own map rather than old guys
censorship for books
f was in sixth grade i needed glasses because i was addicted to computer for so long and my eyes got damaged
another reason that the internet is helpful is for jobs
they give a look of cheapness
to prove the point let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place
everyone knows the basic learning you get in school which is extremely
the author creates many different moods throughout the memoir
stories from grandparents only take a person back about years we need sources that can take us back thousands of years
i have the morals and the mind to choose for myself is good or bad
so they check online and find about it there
most schools have computers
some parents might not know what their child is looking at in the library and wants them to be safer
for example rap music all that is is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are
removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing
the internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method
it just put your mind at ease
that sweat was all over him
there are many things you can do on the internet
you can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book
she gives off a calm relaxed feeling
although if the book is voted to stay in the library i believe the book should be labeled in the correct area
everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries
there are some cases that a victim of an accident recovers with the help of computers
what is so daunting about
the author concludes the story with the paragraph
staying on the computer does not help the situation
another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses other hills tumbleweeds crossed in path
she had good relations in her house
another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph
but his parents stood strong in those hard times
like when he rood through that ghost town
a car was coming at a very high speed
i want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides
later i found that the book was incredibly offensive
the author did not have any good water to drink because it was so hot outside which affected him in that he was dehydrated
libraries as a whole need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books experiences thoughts and hard work
finally computer is a great way to keep busy
the ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased
she had failed the driving test
without a computer people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong
i have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects
there will be more teen mothers than there are needed
now not only did we talk to them but we also get to see them too
when a song artist comes up with a song there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs
first we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back
since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water
you have the right to be able to readwatch or listen to whatever you want
computers also help us stay in touch with our family members and friends
in that part i can tell that she is already starting to change
they want to because they are inappropriate but the thing is they are not inappropriate to everyone
he runs out of water
the computer can help others communicate help educate you and even prepare you for the future
we are a family of five members my grandfather my father my mother and my sister
wait i also agree but spending time on your computer can actually be a good thing
i say that computers have a more positive effect on people
so you should go to the library but no one can take you
cadets and the scouts gave a salute to the chief guest
processing recording storing and retrieving information
has no one ever heard of freedom of speech
when he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water his hope droop a little
i think libraries should only have family oriented movies
almost every family has access to a computer
beggars are a great nuisance
not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too
i feel censorship is a waste of time for the government
i am not one to deny anyone their rights
this was why the setting was affecting the cyclist
in the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers
that is how computers have bad effects on people
the possibility are endless on the web
they hear things from older siblings see uncensored programs on television hear words in music and even learn things from books
one very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert
they can come do there research and rent books
not only does it entertain but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books
a place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book
my brother envied me
families now a days are being broken up due to computers
its amazing how easy it is to talk with other people with the computer
and that is why i support advances in technology and behave computers have a positive effect on people
you want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does
on the other hand are some books offensive to readers
if everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves there would be nothing left
people meet over the internet can be sometimes dangerous because some people lye about there age or put fake pictures of them
just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life the geese will remind her of springtime
thank you and have a good day
well if you are i believe that should not be in front of that computer all day
street beggars are seen everywhere in our country
one kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends
where are the parents out there
about how his parents was so selfless and would always lend a hand to anybody needed help matter who they were
computers are essential to our culture
the library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone
i never get tired of all the pictures all the gossip and all the jokes at the end
from personal experience observations and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries
helped the world to change in better way
in addition computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family
then i study for some time
dear local newspaper i see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society i on the other hand strongly disagree with them
in conclusion this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope good memories and fresh start
reduced stress trading to confidence effect on society
i think some people just get offended too easily
these materials should be taken off the shelves because children reading or looking at these kinds of books and magazines in libraries should not be happening
also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life
the features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist
even though the setting got worse through the story stuck it out made it to the end
so then were left with nothing
i many anymore because they spend all of there are so many things to do in life that will bring you enjoyment than playing on the a computers
i got up and got all the materials and sit back down
you can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone
the if you missed it
some of these features include the heat dangerous animals not a lot of civilization and the terrain
feelings of which we are expected to feel on
if a book is too explicit for children simply place the book in another section
using computers helps society
some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise or even spending time with family
blatantly they are bad for people
that shows how much cares about her mother and father and how respectful is towards them
going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual they are
for example is an author who has been challenged throughout her entire career
dear local you know long of time spent on technology could result in cancer
would that not embarrass you
statistic say the to of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids
we are faced with choices everyday
computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world
have friends from all different race and culture
it just depends on the subject is about and how inappropriate it is
when you are using technology usually it is work related
a holiday can bring great joy if it is spent as a holiday
everyone should have the right to watch read or listen to whatever they want
television news drama life and controversy
computers are so much fun and make life easier
i also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too
therefore why censor
having trouble in school
it is amazing technology because even someone is in a different country you can communicate with them in the click of a button
i would give more importance to cocurricular activities
you will never see the world for what it is
if there was movie that was made that was racist against people the government would probably censor it
it also gets harder as you go getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on
i think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood
it also allows you meet new and different people
my view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles
my cousin is in college right now and i always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing
another horrifying conclusion that the computer does to us is rip apart us from our loved ones
guess what you can blame it on the though the library
we have to stop this devastating pandemic
people should have the right to read what they want to
wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then sees it the abandoned factory
we must always cooperate with him in maintaining law and order
we as a planet need to turn to the only good thing
people interact a thousand times a day on the computers
in factual righting it is something that remains in peoples heads and is saved into the brain like a word document
thin i you for taking so are time reading this
furthermore on the computer you and all you clients can hold a conference call
the opposite situation for books we have them now but when they are taken we will want them even more
libraries hold a lot of important books movies music and magazines
even if the child does not check the book or magazine out who is to stop that young impressionable mind from flipping through the pages
i most people would feel bad
this quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them
without a computer to look up for content things you have to go to the library and check out a bank
just think computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard
computers are a giant step into new technology
computers give kids so much knowledge about things they would not be able to do or go in real life
the computer can only show you nature but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand
he might have died from dehydration
because the more they just sit around
form what i have seen someone want for example a book about taken off the shelf because they are and might not support their religious ways
kids would read anything now because of those kind of things
they are entertaining keeps in contact and helpful with homework
if we should not forget why should the youth learn
dear newspaper have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight
spring has a healthy effect on the body
there was eventually nothing
she says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant
bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child
all this from spending time on the computer
you can argue if something is mediocre is offensive i will argue back just because i have the right to voice my opinion as you do
instead she was with her every step on webcam emailing and
out come the sun shades umbrellas and cotton clothes
the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope
the reason why is family and friends are distant mood swings can occur and also being overweight finally computers can do a lot of things far
he runs a small shop
if freedom of speech is limited what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come
as you can see computers have a positive effect
as soon as i put my ear to her head phones i turned it off immediately
why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway
i believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder
in the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf
as he moved away from his beginning point the cyclist was drinking lots of water
parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world
if you just even look out your window to see this beautiful god created for us you would want to go out there and enjoy
censorship be good for some and bad for others
the books are there for entertainment
besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future
those people could be on there for hours talking to people
a very close family friend was very obese
they could go on the computer and tell their friend
i can mess up your social life with family and friends
so why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people
i took a tally and out of every kids use the internet at least once a day
the mood is of kindness too because he thinks his parents are kind for letting anyone into their door
religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects
is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet
in conclusion people spend to much time on their computers
inappropriate magazines in the reach of children
i have known who have been censored all there life and when they learn about all they cant even handle
computers allow this
there should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from
we rather feel pain at the disorder
we as citizens have the right to make our own choices and our choices should be limited by the views of certain individuals
i think computers do have a positive effect on people
this way i am my friends and relax
the book looked used for its spine was badly split and several of the pages were nearly detached
if movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly
you can search someone or something across the whole world
the more time people use their computers the less time they are enjoying the outdoors
the desert setting also affects the cyclist mind
i strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves
lastly computers help people make money and support their family
i disagree what people say about computers
imagine what it would be like if we expanded this right to the foods that we buy
he reaches school before us to clean and arrange our classrooms
with the games like a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old
she would spend all day and all night on it
i remember the time my cousin came over and we went to the park
finally we can make friends from all over the world
you can also have extra practice with the many resources that come with the online textbook
when you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen
should certain materials be removed from shelves
i know your probably thinking huh
speaking of hurtful the internet is very unsafe
they turned a house into a home
no book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries
have you ever sat there on the computer for a long time
the computers make researching easier just imagine not having to drag home those gigantic books home or having to constantly find information in them
the libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from
will she pass the test
when the cyclist is in the serenity of an early sunset evening the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half
imagine there was no computer for them to use
my bicycle has a carrier too
dear the your resources your entertainment even your communication with people might be fading
these locators allowed you to write down your name disaster should over happen
different people find different things offensive this can be because of race gender ethnicity etc
tools is a better word for these things
there is many benefits to owning a computer
the censorship in libraries needs to be more strict
i think it would be fair to put a restriction on books about age limits
i believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems
from my experience i have seen people complain about these things
there are several problems and risks that come with a computer
now is the time to get up from your computer
i agree with that statement
i think computers are great
computers are very helpful for communication along with
the mood makes me think of the color yellow and of the sun happiness and warmth
first off no one is the same what might be bad to someone else can be good to another person
it also has a homey feeling
i say stay at name and love your internet
but my brother said that they would get scared and run away
that is why i think the author wrote that as the last paragraph
well when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf
some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice
so i use computer parents and i now communicate more than we used to
this winter hibiscus
we live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read watch and listen to
he keeps on however and at last sees a shop where he can get water
most importantly people should become aware of themselves or people they might know or might know knowing this putting into negative situations at them in harm
the snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly
on the other hand though computers open up new worlds to people
this shows how the author is very proud
he had no where to get water or food
not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more
people today rely on being able to speak their minds to be apart of their government
if we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost
taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them
just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor
more and more people use computers everyday
i believe that computers have a baseline effect on people
magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading
we lead pessimistic lifestyles
this also helps people who are shy get married and start a family
another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions
another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain
however to make things even easier libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it
other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness
in the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike
it get harder and harder to continue his ride
realizes that they came to this country to give their children better lives
it also provides us with entertainment if we are interested in playing video games
there hurting your vision limiting your outdoor activity time and making it harder to talk to people in person
think about how life would be in the without computers
being obese is terrible for your health
then you never know what there parents wanted them to know at a young age like that
tennis also increase your heart rate burn fat cells to help you lose weight
to censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens
censorship in libraries has gone on too long it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them
it is required at almost every job application and at school and every thing in between
because of computers people are not exercising as much as they should which is of crucial importance
the hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again
because in the memoir say that he felt graceful and happy about his culture
also you can interact with your friends and family and there are many applications used for business
i strongly urge you to change your opinion from negative to positive about the effects of computers
losing one can be very sad
but if you can get out of the house you could do something a little different from computers video games
computers allow you to communicate conduct business and learn
then my grandmother came out
the first girl answered sends the wrong message
during the spring season we can work for more time
the last thing i would want my children seeing in a is offensive material
the mood in the memoir is grateful
they still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies
for instance if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water
this was because all information was found in books
i looked out through the window
that means that they want to be something when they grow up
she described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes
well the children will learn from those video games and movies
sure they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff
if they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to
but if you had the right to remove the book would you
this memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with culture of who they are
why should your opinion speak for everyone else
dear advances in technology and computers is a bad thing
now a days we do a lot of online shopping
any item you read or listen to will have a word sentence or meaning that will offend a person in some way
it would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection
computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face
i really think that books in age groups will stop the commotion
the setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way
this is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way this is how we think and how we act
he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home
the internet has a lot of web sites about how to get your online
at times she have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone
this is another big concern for people in
censorship in a library should not be allowed
have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked
i really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like
if offensive books are taken down where else will they go they are still going to be offensive somewhere else
i think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times had in his house
hostel life has its own charm
i would just research online or go to another library where i know they will meet my needs
i have tons of experiences of movies books music and magazines that have offended me
what does the parent do when that child brings that book home
is an old family friend of mine
it gives them great pleasure to see them happy and satisfied
the first reason i think that computers have a positive affect on society is because its gives you lots of information
yes i know that there can be some disadvantages
some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
helping the user get the most satisfaction
all my apprehensions came to fore
the easy access to the library is part of the problem
when it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back
the paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year
i found all i needed to know about him getting me that rocking at on my project
my mom said that most of her friends chat online with her
to prevent these issues i say we put a limit on our use of technology
he was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water
that what make kids think its alright when their parents do what ever it maybe
so to rap up my thoughts and feelings
i think that computers teach you more than they disable you
you can find information on anything in a library from any point of view
getting rid of material is not the answer
their is international and much more in the palm of your hand
starting with what they listen to or what they watch
if you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have
what book will be removed from the shelves next
magazines are good for a couple of different nice things
for instance is a way to see your friends like that
he made some very sexually themed music
magazines have certain articles that are racist and certain articles that are very offensive to certain religions
an ideal student should help the parents in household matters he should go to bed at a fixed time
allows someone to talk to another person using the computer
he returned to india
i say we should spend less time on the computer because children spend to much time on online games
well for an example you had to do a project on
aim and are all different ways to interact with each other
the education is just for adults kids can go online and research history of different places they live and want to go
this would not be good for the cyclist because he would be able to get water for his trip
is there enough censorship in our libraries
if i had the right to keep the books and etc on the shelf i would
in this case the authors message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things
third parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways
therefore the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons
i love truth and nonfalsehood
there is little water and it is boiling hot
they need to be in the right state of mind and get back to reality
i think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes she will have many more reasons to take the driving test
i think censorship should somewhat be in libraries but not to the extreme
having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends
then what if they want to keep listening to it
what about how hours of research are two clicks away
the first thing is that the mood is love
the features cause him to consider he die soon as well as present a variety of challenges to him
i found that book to be very offensive just because i was looking at it from a modern perspective
i do realize that it gets out of control with the music movies magazines and books but we know when to settle down and grow up
because some of the things are very mean in books and movies
you can learn about where and how the person lives
although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries
throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents
along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory
deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task
there are a lot of advantages to computers
how she ended it to me was good
violence is very harmful for children
he and his whole family have respected each other and others
children not understand right now what is wrong with the economy but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much
any place you want is at your
and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers
there fun to have because you could play many games on your free time with them too
some believe that this would be a concern because it affects peoples health
for instance making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard
if the reader is mature enough to understand the then the book corresponds with the age of that child
these books should not be aloud to be checked out by kids under the age of unless their parent or guardian allows them to
to me i think every thing should stay
some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are
is it really that big of a deal for kids to see some bad things in books
those people use the computer everyday but they use it correctly only for and they are just well are very smart and get good grades in school
not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history
therefore materials such as books music movies and magazines should never be removed from public places
moreover computers are chock full of information
would have gotten a for the project
days you can talk through the with a person in without needing to go to
if you are sad and need to talk to somebody you are a few clicks away from being cheered up
recent research from says that of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computer every day are over pounds
he drank all his water and now he felt desperate
street beggars are a common sight in big cities
just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book movie or music that is not there age group
everyone can choose their own opinions
one is on a rainy day
next the fact that there were no buildings houses or anything in sight affected him
no matter what we do some one will be offended
a computer has endless information on any topic unlike books
they help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words
if you have a friend or relative that lives very far away you can easily go at talk and have a video conference
you can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work
as a teenage reader my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country
if a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them
it is their job to just offer information
he starts off describing his life so far and family
first of all he was in the desert on a bike
later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply
movies and television
for instance i have a grandma that lives in
dear newspaper computers have a huge effect on society can you even imagine where we would be without them
if computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age
windows and programs will really benefit you in your need for school help
taking away these books will limit education
when it comes down to the choice you will know just what to do
there are cursing smut and in books that for children should not read
first the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated
if you are riding and begin to run low on water your in trouble
no one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song
so should these types of things be taken out of libraries
if a reader knows that this kind of reading offends them then they should know better than to pick up the book in the first place
it makes you stronger
and which is for all age groups
finally computer cost a lot of money
a misleading challenge but a challenge
libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children
therefore i would not be able to read as much
it was important to express this again
did you know that anybody can view your profile which contains personal info
they could also not be spending time with family
for example turbo tax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and it remembers every tax you have paid
libraries are a communal institution open to all views and writings
in the story it said
for example exercise
they overburden themselves with work
i think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing books do not normally have an inappropriate cover while bad movies often do
most people instead of taking action will be on the computer
but with strong determination he rods on
when you have a computer you can get influenced by other musicians to create music
simply follow the rating rules
he said that what they did was a more courageous thing than he could have ever done
it could even locate a wounded soldier
materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people
no and why might that be
if you have a close friend who moved across the country then these ways to communicate would be very helpful to you
they are good because you can learn things educational
my father got up and started calling me
then the cyclist could carry on
there is a reason why there is so many different genres
the says that they opened the door to any one who came in and they always shared dinner with family
hobbles thirst and fear were all behind me
computer games online can be fun but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill and purposed of you child
my first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use
libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind
you can also tell that he is implying that he loves his parents
to look at and use would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive
there was no one in sight not a building car or structure of any kind
when you are on the computer the internet allows you to search anything and everything
by online in chat rooms bank etc
i think this because people use it to research stay in touch with friends and family and music
also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time
i agree with the experts who think that we should spend more time outdoors with friends and family
however when he realizes its old juice factory he grows bitter
the final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library
first of all after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen he enters an area that is greatly isolated
just because some one finds them offensive
this past i was in and i had to stay with this family
literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored
that person then could end up using the information for the worst
children and adults are spending too much time on the computer which causes to lose eye sight
and other magazines like it needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible
the cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did
you will never know because everyone has there own and who knows whose opinion is right
but there will always be someone who is unhappy
i can remember my friend telling me that she always types her essays because its for her teacher and from typing
there are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life
yes and no some materials such as books music movies magazines etc should be voted upon the citizens to be removed from shelves
if someone did want to see or check out these materials they should need proof that they are eighteen or older
until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone
that is why is bad to use a computer a lot i hope u understand
did you know that of people on dating sites set
clearly it is better to spend less time on the computer and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends
now that their in their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland and how there life used to be
why i think we should have computers
instead of making a habit of going online everyday why not make a habit like try to get all your homework done each night
with all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures
just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff

with computers communication is a
censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public
then there was a ladder show

the answer to all those questions is the
the reason i think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life
if some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die
another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads

the libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age
but we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone
if you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet
then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else
this author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work be recognized
this would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is
there are many things in a library that if not careful could corrupt your children
the rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder
our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a little higher
therefore i do not think that certain books or music should be kept away from the shelves due to a few self opinions

that is why computers are good and we need them
keep in mind that it can help with homework talking with friends or just having some fun
it saves gas money and time
you are addicted both your family you suffer
but what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books

although kids should start going outside computers teaches kids new things and is useful
a lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come
but come on do you really think a book could cause a problem

finally i just want to say that if you have a problem keep it to yourself
another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type

as the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts
kids them even teens and adults love

dear local newspaper i believe the computer does have positive perks but it also has negative perks
second they help people communicate with people from other areas

for generations we have grown up in a world of diversity
when i am on the computer to long i know
thus all his works of literature were partial to the humble common man
this implies that it is very hot outside
i believe that the book or magazine or should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it
it also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away
visit a local park or play a sport for fun
i wanted to so why cant you
nature provides us with fresh air through plants and trees
even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you
they are used as medicine
true people do protest laws and with good reason
lots of kids and teens go online to make new friends
these are how the features affect the cyclist journey
there are various kinds of dogs such as german shepherd alsatian and pomeranians etc
he is not at all considerate
when she sees the plant labeled jasmine she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair
also if i got kicked out of the library i would just go to another one
computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material
depends on the parent
the classrooms are large
but the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak
in paragraph the author writes about the closeness and kindness of his neighborhood
it can be used for so many things you can also purchase items over the computer
the media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad
the second girl was right
this is really bad because you were on the computer
his water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason
they can talk send pictures or play games
also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant
should offensive material be removed from the library
we learn information about the world and about what is going on
people could get sick probably forget a lot of stuff and never have the future that they have always wanted
she was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes
let us educate our children for the future of humanity
you might not like you might even hate
so young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age
they can provide us with emotional release from the everyday world
the thoughts of the youth is completely swayed after they watch read or listen to this
secondly computers interfere with family and friends
such as slavery the taking over the and a lot of our world history
the computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in you can talk to somebody else in
it teaches us about everything everything
for example my neighbor comes home after school by herself
the cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak
whether it was from a parent or even their best friend they have heard it
is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture
it also helps you do many stuff for your own future not just to play around with some new friends
they are living in an apartment that has one room but years later they moved to a apartment
this is a movement that should change the opinion of many do people spend to much time on computers
i think that their should be rooms were certain adult books are at
how you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library
i talked to the people who have just started to use computers and out of people said that they had liked what they had seen
fake and dangerous info when we have book
some restrict their child from such material but i would call that depriving a child of there freedom
my first reason why i think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community
you can make what that person stand for meaning nothing at all
if i was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language
he was pulled into our boat
the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one
here is my second reason
like i said everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it
how about your newspaper company
people do not care much about their health until they fall ill
now she can be prepared
in my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things
certain rated material should be put in certain spots for certain people
then the biker listened and he went on down the road
the whole range of knowledge is based on orderliness around us
every day in the morning before school checks on the weather on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school
the mood of the author is happy
we as humans enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make
first kids might have problems online and to keep the problem to get worst
the reason i would describe the mood as soft and compassionate is
a third reason is companies are able to use them to gain business
whether teens kids or adults are gaming on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers
you can still interact with your family and friends either in chat or
if based on a true story and offensive it should be heard anywise because part of history
you would be putting someone out their job
if you have a computer you will have video games
when we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more
then there are the sappy movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a session of steamy sexual actions
this is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up
i think that its cool that you are playing the exact game with another
sure there are some books that children should not be allowed to see due to offensive material but why remove them completely
i do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school
children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility where fun and interesting facts should be found not racial slurs
it would be very helpful to so many people
it has grown extremely popular in chatting
dear local newspaper do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer
the man would curse his lungs out
in hos winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph
they also teach you new things
have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book
there are many people on the computer and if must be stopped
that is to help you spell the words out correctly
computers are a big waste in time and a bigger waste in money
so why get rid of something that they will see anyways
lastly computers allow us to internet with friends from our chairs
they all brought gifts for me
censorship is much needed everywhere it would help out a lot
the internet keeps us updated and informed on whats going on all around the world without even going there
later in life when i have kids i would like them to dream about what they want to do in there life
i think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration
also some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime
these days so many things offend so many people in so many different ways
first the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off
i believe that computers do not benefit society of all
henceforth i believe that computers serve a positive advancement in technology and its effect on people are rather great
it approaches the prey stealthily
good bye to that book
if people were to go and start doing things besides the computer they will live a happier healthier and better life
it was to the point of dying
my grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was
everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive
it was a big red vehicle
dear i think that having a computer is a very positive
i conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on
we can drink water from rivers and freshwater lakes
we shouted at the top of our voices
bookfairs bring the authors and readers close to each other
it would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials because one person had got offended
so i would go with both sides
lastly the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe
kids believe most of what they watch in movies
even then things get worse
if you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want the odds they might not do good in school
so why do they keep releasing and publishing books if it offends certain groups
before you know it will have to know how to work a computer
is very grateful throughout the memoir
that affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling
children of the age to should be able to read books with any profanity
most people barely see their family when their at home because their consumed in the computer
he is a useful member of the society
also books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about
maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriateespecially in the world we live in today
first being that there will always be something offensive to someone no matter what it or not be
laptops have made it easier to block people out
i reached jaipur one hour late
boat ride into the night and it was gone
they have friends on but no friends in real life
its easy type in what city you want to work in and there you go
they believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library
sometimes we wait for him impatiently
therefore a book that not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it
next using computers saves trees
people want to move forward but can we not make a compromise
there is a number of impacts these skills can make
i believe that people should be able to choose what content they decide to read and let their children read
that is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world
another reason is to express the theme
another thing computers are great for is talking
computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world
and computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people
children get so caught up in a computer game everything around them just disappears
there are fifty varieties of roses in my garden
if they think it is offensive then they should put it back on the shelf and go find something else
if you need to learn your multiplication table you type it in and it will show up in the matter of seconds
it helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through
we can also get it from activities
to prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it
i would be lost and confused without these emails what i depend on
many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future
not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone
who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature
are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story
there are many ways you can do this on twitter yahoo
sometimes kids forget their text books at school
the world in full of offensive material and there almost nothing we can do for it
this would play a roll on children that use this library also
for example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park
this is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers
you can also communicate with people who has an email address
his tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture
books are the key point to education and most peoples daily lives
the cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out no one could help him
but what are wasting money on
sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into
would you give them the right to keep it from you
in my opinion computers have a positive effect on people
i believe computers have a positive effect on people because they can be used to learn communicate and entertain
as time goes on our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology such as the television
but i think as much i did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall
if computers were no more it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country
so people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer
the author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied
it is a very negative effect
when hot the heat dehydrates you
having a computer is a huge benefit to society
such as stuff from anther culture or maybe something from a different religion
the last i have is spending more time with family than on the computer
so instead buying newspapers or magazines most people go online to research current events
the mood that the author was happiness
now no one has to get in a car and go visit any one else
computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other
not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing
he also gifted me a new bicycle
thank you for listening
the is a book of understanding and knowledge
it is a season of birth and growing
well it makes life a lot easier and faster for people
not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book magazine movies music etc
also it is used to make reports up for people
we learn about our history for a reason does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through
secondly the computer is like a tutor
he starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men
this memoir is all about heritage and the home
computers are used in many schools to help teach students about new things
there is things like sex songs
this article deeply offended me but i am glad i read it and saw a different point of view
you can playing games with people from ground the world
the plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again
while typing your report on the computer you might spell a word wrong well every computers has spell check
last but not least i am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising
also kids get into dangerous for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to
last reason would be children should not allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older
i even have an application for it on my cellphone
some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that will past the test
no one has glued their fingers to it
the freedom we have is a freedom of choice
having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable
they change the medical field too
people become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it
we walked out the front doors and we were on our way home
they wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life
this is unacceptable on a person why we should be prohibited in computers
books should not be removed for many reasons
i will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason
this can also bad for future generations
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways
they cause addiction which end up taking over peoples lives
paid over nineteen dollars for the plant
sure you can video chat but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a persons words
exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person
your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers
you can check information about something you ever forget
the next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode
smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill
at this point she has an epiphany and realizes that life is like seasons
censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books
this is how the computer can help you research any topic
all help make our lives a lot easier at times
education is very important especially in our economy today
i think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves
this might be fine at first but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want
the offensive material can be history that the world need to know such as racism
colours in a person’s attire reflect his personality
computers are a great way to get in touch with people
par this gives the memoir a friendly mood it shows that the author loved his whole neighborhood
you never know who might need the information
another thing they might do go to a website that could help them find affordable
or you can just have simple talk and are great websites to keep in touch with old friends of you even make new friends
information in libraries should not be censored even if the information is considered offensive
ancient indian medicines prescribe cosmic colours to bring equilibrium in human cells
the place was full of small and pretty houses
so people do have a choice on what should be banned or not but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too
they were just writing a book
i think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing jobs and schoolwork
unless it is a closely grounded secret
my leaves for thatching their houses
ask yourself this how would computers have a positive effect in your life
these examples show the change of setting on the cyclists trip and how it affected her
without computers people could not learn new things
authors have the right to put profane language in their books and even dirty ideas
all you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you
finally computers also create many distractions to students
i believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication but people today over use that power
in do not exceed posted speed limit a cyclist follows some bad advice which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water
dear newspaper i strongly believe that computers do not benefit society
trust them they know what they are doing
he has to use to check on the stock chart
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the setting affects the story very much for many reasons
for example the rough road
i have also been in this position where i came cross an article that upset me
computers have a positive effect in so many ways for example school work talk to other and just get information
the essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction
on the occasion of the fair and big meeting he maintains peace by applying for law and order
besides education computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire
the cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
during this time computers are becoming more and more popular
instead of being on the computer learning hand eye
after that extent the kids would be learning too much at such a young age
if keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons let it be organized chaos
just remember whenever you can go out and play or hang out with friends and family
dear post computers have been here for a while now and taking them away would be like forgetting all the progress we made in technology
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated troubled and relieved
they put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini
computers are also great for talking online to family and friends
i have aunts that i cannot live without who are strong base who i cant live without talking to for a day
then he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like battery acid
i remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used based language
this piece makes me think about and appreciate my family and my home
another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction
and if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape how will it ever stop
the amount of people that lack a sufficient quantity of exercise has risen in the past decade
personally books are made for a reason whether some people like it or not
so instead those people could just quickly and easily send a email no instant message to who ever they need to talk to
it could most likely cost you or even family members your lives
many features of the setting affected the cyclist
there is also morals behind them
my mother has to yell at me to have my lunch
well the only reason is uncensored books at the library
in the story about dehydration it says the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips
soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon
sometimes just to help them get back on their feet
getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence
libraries contain thousands and thousands of books and other materials
books magazines movies and all types of media are placed there for the same specific purpose to learn and explore
also to be able to learn about faraway places will help in school
so therefore it should not be any reason that the materials should be removed from the shelves
we returned home tired but very happy
surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes
if a person cannot think for themselves they cannot draw their own conclusions on things
we need to turn the computers bring out the board games and keep families together
for example flat roads was replaced by short riding hills as the terrain was changing so was his attitude
in the end computers can teach you many things
when we get hurt he takes us to the school doctor
one way is to keep in contact
without those books in that library i would have never been able to research those topics
i don know why these books are even needed in a library
so if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight
but much like the geese returning in the spring she says she will retake the test
rooms are the main why
also i remember when my computer broke and i wanted to go on the computer so badly
it is as simple as that
an example of the vastness of the park was when he quote about forty miles into the pedal i arrived at the first town
instant message them and video chat with them instead on having to face out money to make long distance calls
the author gave the happiness to the cultures they have settled with the author giving them friendship and happiness
everyone has their own views which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material be to them
it sits there and looks at me with its shiny eyes
my last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running
censoring hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus
for example the libraries have information on the history
in addition computers can help people get neat and clean
the cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down giving up on hope
it also make the person feel violated and offended
everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs
that leaves people the choice to watch listen or read the things they want and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them
so after that we pretty much argued the whole time
if some people want to fill their mind with filth let them
the setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat
it really close make things go faster
well the had to choose a side and the side that they have chosen that computer have a positive affect on people
this also shows that the mood is happy because the author is grateful
if it is educational it be useful to some people
as you can see from these examples the memoir had a very thankful and gracious mood to it
i believe that if you have a or you have a chance to meet people from all over the world
computers are a waste of money
even though computers are great for fun working and learning are much easier online
now tell me who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested
computers help us with our education
it also helps in sports
there are also websites where you can talk and connect with other people who share the same interests as you
a snake charmer is a common sight to indian villages
people do have a reason to read books that are offensive
face it everybody needs it
have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next
they also have the right to not read the book at all
my love for my subject has inculcated in me the habit of reading
everyone has their own favorite book or genre
they would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves
your an old fashion woman who believes in old fashion ideals such as no cursing or violence
in addition when people become addicted to computers they become less social with friends and other people like parents teachers and more
society is a whole lot different then when parents were kids
such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand he does not know how to learn
a second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him
if a person does not want to be exposed to things in libraries that could be considered offensive then they can altogether avoid these materials
firstly its very educational
lastly i would like to express how i feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries
so being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make worse
he has to work under scorching sun and pouring rains
all big and small companies depend upon these agencies to catch the market for their products
whether it be in writing singing or pictures you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate
everyone knows it and everyone loves it
if they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice
maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism
another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting
all of can happen from staying off of computers
my last and strongest reason that technology can help you find anything in everyday life
this caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty
i think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
these books movies magazines could show what is going to happen to you
sometimes they have to choose between and it depends on how graphic things are
they can still be fit but if they go on the computer instead of working off all the
if you do you will learn so many things
they can and most likely will come to your house for you
she bought it for more then her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden
i should probably start rapping things up
for example not all kids like to eat corn
that way the material will no longer be public but rather your own and you can do with it whatever you choose
if you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward
dear i believe that computers have a negative affect on people
as you can see this is why the mood of the memoir is warm happy and inviting
some people find things more offensive than others
they do have a profile which you be able to relate to but they could be lying
the author said that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative
this means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season
this one band got banned in the united states of for there music
if the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in
this tired him out faster since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain
my family being immigrants from another country my family
your bank account number
i will teach the poor children without only charge
not to mention it has fun games for people to play when there bored or have nothing to do
for movies there are many different types
you know reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to
censoring we all know that language is the foundation of human legacy
there was a night in called when radical and supporters burned houses stores and even books
events seemed pretty bad until the speaker became elated when they saw a factory
therefore the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution
third say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork
dear local newspaper home computers is a good thing for many reasons
the people who loved the series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them
i believe the computer is critical for success and happiness in life
people have had serious injuries and scams placed on them because the internet
third is its taking away authors money and point of view
everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair
the games are also fun and non violent
baseball is why i can bench press pounds
finally and most importantly computers help improve communication between people
well you you could simple a computer helps people different things
well i am saying you should go on it and search were you want to go
computers are a lot of fun
i without slight hesitation stand against censorship in every way
not only are you getting good benefits on the outdoors but so is your partner
it is a carnivorous animal and its long mane gives it a handsome and proud look
lastly it can even increase you chances of finding a job or helping out your job
this can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes
dear experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers which is harmful to their health
that is why i think the author ended the story that way
although the invention of chat online was meant as quick easy communication it became a horror crime in most cases
and then we have no book left on the self for any of us
they also augment the information i use
you can chat with people from across the world
to my name is i am from
why i stated that is its unhealthy for many people
if a person is offended by something someone wrote they should just avoid reading it
computers are ruining lives
as you can see this is why i believe it is positive
the computer positively contributes to our education economy and entertainment
my last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family
people that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much
i that if people want to use computer they can
had a warm and loving childhood which he depicts greatly in his memoir
i understand that some people not agree with me however i propose that my side is the best
i know that when my library had a series of books that i found interesting that i was back in there after i finished each one
i will tell you you would lose customers
if an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not
this can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like
these waves are linked to diseases and cancers
the author concludes the story with that like to leave the reader guessing
this quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time
eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good
i though it was ridiculous because it was only a movie and it was harmless
there a books music movies magazines and etc
the pitcher pitches the ball and wham
to sensor a book from a teenager or child is just like more of an invitation to see whats inside of it
the affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office
they would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats
for example in the story it says but its strong enough to make it through the cold months
you should not teach you children off of things like that it will make them want to do things without thinking or considering what is really going on
the heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired
many jobs these days typically banks rely on using the internet most of the time and some actually are based in the internet
secondly computers make it very easy to communicate with others
not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human
the author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to
a library should not be biased
this shows that things do change but they are also the same
children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways
i just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though
if i were a bird i would have really enjoyed flying around our wonderful nature
snakes usually creep
these computers are bad for people
itself has influenced computer use
libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge
their job is to supply the community with books movies magazines etc
also it ends on a good note if was like i stayed up in my crying that would not be good ending
call me and we will talk this through
computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time
with my mother’s help i have made a big collection of different models of planes
how would you explain why it was offensive
you could build a lot
do you like your computer
some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of and
this is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books
i believe that the effects on people negative
here are some reasons why you should get a computer for your family
we went to a garden near our school
the person should just not read the book
in ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days
despite what people believe though computers are very good for our daily lives
the people who want to see the latest movies that just came out are usually going to see some type of violence
but everything was in a real mess
you cant have these accounts without a computer therefore we need computers
not only that but don you think typing is faster than writing
this stampcollecting hobby refreshes my mind
then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information
why not learn from them and reflect
we are on the brink of violence and total chaos
on top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable
people spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted
though out this story there is a certain of
it could end up in a huge problem not only for the children and their parents but also for the school
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly
she decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation and was ready to bloom she would be ready to accept her new country and move on
i am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good
but let someone express who they are through their likes and dislikes
finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world
adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper
to the main character friendships and home is very important to him
we are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine
computers could be people far away friends but how about instead call that friend on
for it would not be something that went well in our history
my initial reason why i agree is because most kids never spend time with their families
initially when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease
you can do researching say in touch with friends and family and do a lot with music
it would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books
everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials
as i read this i could feel a warm welcoming from home
they show the results or how the situation was handled
when the gone was about to start the looked into the crowd for his dad
this has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain
dear computers have a very positive effect on people
in my opinion we should get rid of computers in every house
every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to
but is there really anything they can do
once i found this out i asked mother to please take it back
second the allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world
so leader of the paper do you really along with everyone else think that computers are a waste of time in life
the rainy days that follow are a blessing
these types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life
does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because will not read it
another thing is children taken books off shelves
the government has given people freedoms
i am very fond of my dog
there is several book in the library that young children should read
that is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer
for all of these reasons censorship in libraries should not be allowed
after along to more hows of playing
this is ten times easier that going on the and waiting for the news stone you want details on
also when he passed the grape juice factory it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty
i mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area
with him running out of water he is in real trouble
maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book
so for the censorship towards different groups of people there will have to be some tolerance
as soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go he set off through tall cool pines
this gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive
i have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict
this meant was that you had to be in shape
they said yes mostly because they were so thrilled that i even wanted to read a book so challenging
it is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination
computers ruined my life
the people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes
but robin is my best friend
even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some
almost everything on the computer has to be read so gives a lot of practices
next reason is being on the computer too much can effect most peoples grades
this can work to people away from screens and the course
one instance of this media censorship
like it might be a comic book that my say something that someone my take offense to
i believe that people are entitled to their own opinion about what they choose to listen to read or watch everybody has their own level of maturity
the effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to
censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the come from many different places making the very diverse
people deserve to read watch or listen to anything that they want
it is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way
we had shifted to singapore recently and so i had to change to this school
next computers can help you learn new things online
they are getting obese
the kid section is a section that all kids can use because we know that that section of books would be harmless to kids
all you did was get worked up and you wasted money
as you can see education is the most important reason why we use computers
these things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology
people always say that the world is going to end
dear i believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society
with more and more people using computers
it is east to communicate using a computer
you can use it to find info
there are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph
the main idea here is preferences
what should be done about the books movies magazines and movies that are offensive to some of the people
i hope you think about this
my views on censorship are strong
as you can see a computer is so helpful and is a great resource
i hope you listened to my opinion on computers and i also hope you continue to tell people how great and important computers are
however you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read
com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time
i do not think they should just be removed and out of the way
that shows how grateful the author is because he thanked his parents more than once
he is a true friend and a sincere guide to the students
and how important family and friends are
staying up to late like on a school day and your tired
first computers can help find out how to do things
the author creates a comforting mood because he talks about his home his family and what he grew up with
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story
another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our we are given the right to express ourselves freely
overall computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices
it might just start a revolution
the author explained how her parents were very courageous and brave for leaving their home land
i hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible
the text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies
it would be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge
in our country today we have many different ethnic groups and many people think differently about things
with this new technology you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time
as you can see i need my computer for many things
no one should take something off the shelf if it is offensive because it was their choose to look at it in the first place
dear walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen i earning new and exciting information they can everyday
when the goal is to protect people especially children from harmful material it can be used sparingly
also living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family
but they can go online and take classes on their free time
if there was not anymore books in the library children would not be able to learn or grow
i believe that some materials we have in our shelf belongs to basically anybody in the world
they are going to miss out of nature or hanging out with friends
so you see the internet is a great use for kids
people are different and they will thank different things
on the other hand i can see why adults would want the books censored
she uses her cell phone to set an alarm
your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall
you can even see pictures
they have gone to the college fund for money
it would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if store or people would have been around exact is the animals
about of kids and adults go on these online pages every day its time they stayed going on their computer more time on outside or hangout with their friends
our bodies need to stay healthy and fit
on the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address
with a computer typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition
if he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer
the emotions test of both of the situations she is is will allow her to be stronger
you never know what topic pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature
loves and appreciates what her family did for her
in paragraph nothing really happens so there is no real feeling
there are special places for porn such as the internet
working from home makes another day at the office another day at home
movies can bring things to life
these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves
this transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story
he was confident he could conquer anything
this is what the statement is saying she failed her tasks so in the spring once the hibiscus blooms again she will attempt to complete her task
although it might offend some people they have a choice whether they should see watch listen and read it
only fun and energized people get out and get active
it puts them and their whole family in danger
even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer
books are another good resource if used correctly
it has been bought to mind that people fight about computers to a doubt i think that computers have a positive on people
i know that a lot more kids too because i was reading in a magazine that of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer
having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes
i have a little library of my own at home
they will do anything to understand it
also if it was or to me i would the use of computers
i was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me
come on did this change your mind yet now
that is what keeps us interested in what we are doing
this is needed especially in school
without the computer people would not be where they are in life right now
the setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice
the computer is one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events
in the end a system that caters to the most sheltering of parents is the best one
to watch the geese return
now some parents have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book but parents should have control over their kids
who wants to do that
computers are also beneficial because of what huge resource they are
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy
writing a paragraph essay takes to long so use your computer to help you out
for one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and
in this day in age numerous advances in technology are being made everyday
this is what the mood was in the memoir of was portrayed as
computers are a good source to have now that is just my opinion
this application allows you to take notes by typing which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper
his mother also often eats dinner alone
allowing a child not to read a book such as is unpractical and harmful to the child
she feels the snows meet the geese return she says that she will take that test again
people know what they want
to whom it concern i think computers are a good thing
another good example is movies
with computers kids are rarely going outside
his description of this home is very soothing to me because it just has a happy background and his talk so highly of
a good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the books just because they use the n word and some people find this offensive
hes frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it
this is how i grew up
another survey done by the magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one
they would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed
in my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities
in the blazing sun i cannot go out
while some people complain others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report
the flower outside in the cold must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive
the author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time
this also shows that the library or so far as the country is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed
do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
information is open to those that search for it and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results
this book has many issues when it comes to political correctness
if your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on that was do in a week what would you do
people get a pleasant surprise when the clown starts dancing on the rope or wire
computers are not having a negative affect on society
on the computer we have popular websites like and
these are all the reasons why she used the last paragraph
children are the future and they need to be taught the right way
some material be inappropriate for younger readers
the internet is also a good way to stay in contact with close friend or relative
the author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible something will be the to lift your spirits
his parents were selfless
and only occasionally would he get an or two from his asking how his days was
also its a desert like setting adding to his thirst
furthermore a book contain images not suitable for children
when the person no matter who it isgoes out into the world
should them type of things but in the with children
movies bring out imagination and stories where people can watch and follow along
the mood of this memoir is happiness
all i can really say to that is it is their decision
what they are told on the television is thought of to be factual and that is what they do all day
now people can think that computers are good for you too
everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like
and you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive
the last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with
it takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected
they have it all if you ever need something for research or a project just go there
censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own
people should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life
this biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summers day
has as much the same right as i did
the new trend in schools all around the globe is the addition of computers or a computer lab
when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again
i lived with them very happily
well i think not how would that make you feel
friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them
people are not getting exercise so the gain more weight
i think being on the computer is unhealthy
you could even keep in touch with them from
not everyone has to listen to rap nor do they have to listen to opera
about the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world
make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids
when people come in looking for some good information about something they look forward to finding good tips and not being let down
his gratitude is being showed towards his parents
offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age
alsoi recently learned and am getting pretty good
so i hope you enjoyed reading essay
next you spend less time playing nature
in my family i am not allowed to listen to offensive music
the features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather
it deals with the techniques of
many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society but the problem is once you start censoring where do you stop
this will be good for every race too
this document has amendments
a recent of a computer
this causes the kids to act in different ways
i can see how some of those books could be banned
please take this letter into consideration
lastly if you are getting ready to go on a trip you can check flight information with the click of a button
some of the family members they would have were grandparents aunts and cousins
it changed from flat road to short rolling roads
this made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people
sometimes she spends nights and nights without sleeping
i think these websites are great and can only improve society
many people even work from home thanks to their computers
if we took all of these books off the shelves there would be nothing left to read
but you as parents should control what your kids are reading
she bought a hibiscus and went home
people should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect
one get frustrated doing all work that is done by her
they help us communicate do important thing have fun
i want to read something that is going to grab my attention and make me want to keep reading
i believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online
after his survival of his surroundings for as long as he could go gets help at a real camp
just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills makes your legs hurt
the driver of the red car seemed to have not lost faith either
it mostly educates it
these magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation
computers are growing daily
in conclusion offensive materials should remain in libraries
now in a library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs
now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world
this issue is debatable but really i think that computers are not helping the big picture
for example be there very own website
the hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland
they brought love to all people
the problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable
imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off
recently though some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society
many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things such as drugs
plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books then they can monitor that themselves
also that she is going to start making the best out of life
dear or the purpose of this letter is about how computers have changed our lives for the better
books are big powerful and a vast amount of information
do you want a more economically advanced state
the internet and overall help in future situations
he expresses his gratitude several times
computers have good or bad effects
some people have long distance relationships right
those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer
as you can see jobs use the computer
as for music it can go both ways
so if we keep all our book then more students and people would go and read
it shows he learned the most important lesson it this house
in the essay do not posted speed limit the setting effects the cyclist in many ways
i love family but i interact with them
these allow you to send someone a message faster and easier
this is why i support the computers
in conclusion this is the mood the author is giving
he also saw the grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions
secondly there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it
they will be able to do sample everyday asks much better
to begin people are spending too much time on computers
which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places
lastly computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends
secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places
it would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder
so he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men
the natural world is ever changing and you will miss out on a lot of amazing opportunities if you hardly ever step foot outside your front door
dear newspaper i disagree with you about computers
because of the internet people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors
to conclusion i believe computers have a huge negative effect on people
we see these colours in a rainbow
computers are the future and its a good one
this could be a huge problem in the future
in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit the settings of the story affect the cyclist
you can learn how to type really fast
however i do not think that the books magazines etc
so should we keep using computers for the good of our society or not use computers to exercise more
in the story the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride
i think this for a few different reasons
be active and stay healthy
some people find ways to get those censored as well
they could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside
computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other more important matters
i strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public
he hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place
getting rid of the material is not what should be done
you know as well as anyone most video games are not good for you
all you gotta do is talk to them online
the time has come to take a stance
the setting in rough road ahead do not posted speed limit definitely affected the author
she had the determination to succeed so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion
this makes the cyclist thirsty and tired
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips water is a big importance
the effects that i have on computers are good
the man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own
these taught the main character how to love and how to care about someone
you could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor
he took the help of another bus driver
i think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what
complex simple to use technological a world of pictures simple art and history right at your fingertips
if you can read you can do anything you could be the one to run to whole world one day if you read things right
we need books for many things from learning to simply use up time
i know as a young child when things were not going so well i could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things
i think that should have the freedom to choose what to read watch or listen to
so you have to look at it in not only your point of view but other people point of view
i remember the time i was having trouble in math so my teacher gave me this website called a
let me throw out an example to you
imagine birds chirping up in the trees deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond
my eyes stink when i am on the computer for half an hour
i like to become an artist when i grow up
those books movies and magazines that are offensive are enjoyable to me
dear i think computers have a positive effect on people because it will help you with interacting learning and coordination
have you ever researched anything using a computer
the world a better place to live when everyone has a level playing field
so she becomes determined to pass the test
after reading do not exceed posted limit i have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things
in conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more
i spend most of the day on my computer doing homework than off it
many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time
computers have nothing but positive effects on people on society as a whole
all in all the moods in the story fit together nicely
he also mentions music as being passionate and that he still adores it even to this day
the author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer
another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water
now jaipur was in sight
but english as it is not literary
some people do go to the library an not find what there looking for
furthermore instant messenger is the most addicting
just give the book a chance and see how everybody likes it
this is there because going to the library means you have to round up the kids get in the cor and go
and nobody should ever try to take that away
i know in my experiences i have found some things that were offensive so i am sure that they are out there
society computers to get information
if we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs things will get out of control
he dusts the principal’s office and the staff room
to whom it concern computers can be a great asset to our society but they are an even bigger hindrance
in a recent report the states that in the past five years the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled
the magazines should never be checked out
i know that i would try to contact them on the computer
in opinion they make our town worse
he writes the story with much appreciation of his parents family and life which is very admirable
the next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature
computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets
each materials brings enjoyment to different people
those people that are offended need to put whatever is down and move on
when the cyclist reached the bait store he probably felt much better and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke
censorship is required for every library and i think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements
i believe this because they make you smarter they help with entertainment needs they also give you the option to socialize with websites and online chatting
all these thing can be reversed
based on the memoir the mood created by the author in the memoir was filled with lots of love and satisfaction
take interest in their life and shower love unconditionally on them
he stays in queen street a very busy and crowded area of singapore
families also are distant form each other when they sit around on
others enjoy it whether they share your views or
i know this is my thoughts and believes people completely think what i wrote it stupid some think its smart
no one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them
especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope
the world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures and what better way than to talk to them
the answer to that is through our history
she means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time
for school events sport schedules and keeping in touch with far away family and friends
computers are helpful to us by doing work that has to be done neatly
a that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion
if people choose to let their children read books then that is fine with me
there are many programs that you can use to write documents make graphs and whatever you need to do
so now what do you believe should certain materials be removed
last minute things can even be online
i personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves
this is because she types and researches information all day long
the old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years
another thing computers are used i for as learning
by family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another
there will always be at least person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike
thank you for listening to me
as it states in paragraph
you the computers are a positive effect on people
like the program excel created this to make a simple way to organize data
took a poll about how many use the computer to do research and answered that they did
the author parent show him with their life and his teaching have been the basis of his life
i can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where i can learn all about the places i want to visit
the parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading
one person can slowly make a difference person by person that is exactly what this family did
the people will find out what they want there kids to read and listen and watch and so will they
everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age
picture yourself sitting at your desk talking to some friends online
computers can expand on many peoples opportunities for education
dear i am writing to tell you about the effects computers have on people
another person might read it and like it
lastly computers are useful and should be useful more
for instance when arriving at the first town the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence
a library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something find an interesting read or just relax
for example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well
this is way computers can be a bad thing
dear newspaper even though there are good effects of computers on people there are also many bad effects
the internet is an extraordinary invention that is very simple and helpful to use
please read the following reasons
involves you playing games that help you and tests when you are ready to take them
but also people who listen to that type of music might be disappointed
they are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary
books that some people like are found offensive by others
not to mention you can go with a family friend of even be tutored
libraries are great use for that
she wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain
this is why movies books magazines or even music should not be removed from shelves
image is the key to how people view society today
i use to search it all the time and i made a poster project for fun
he plans his lessons with great care
buy a whole a couch and even your groceries in only ten minutes
it is a gift of the nature
it also lets people interact with others in a different way
children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines
you can find pictures videos maps and much more
three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people
do you agree that computers take over lives
hardly anyone will read them anyway
first teens can do harmful stuff on the internet to themselves or others
even though she has failed her drivers test
she said the book was about the way a society had banned books like they were drugs or something that could hurt us
my car is remotecontrolled
the first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother the second only ten minutes and the last a mere five minutes
like i said before when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time
who is to stop someone from taking off books once this processes has started
here is another reason why computers are good
her baby sitter became her first friend
it is the most efficient way to talk to friends
many people think the book should be censored
computers have made things a lot impact on children but we all new things i when we use computers
to were no little kids can rent the book
in his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on
this presents a mood of happiness
i remember when i was doing a project on of music
those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world
computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date
dear readers some of you might think people exercise computers
this knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly
another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well
this was the mood created by the author in the memoir
when the author put in the conclusion it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel
he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on
many express their religion by means of music and culture
features of the setting really affect a cyclist
the hibiscus will bud when the seasons change
would you be able to about from you living rooms without computers
in the story rough road ahead the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways
in some cases reading and knowing certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world
we can have teacher help tell the kids an let them no that it not right for them to watch that
this is when computers come in handy
it is our moral duty to help all those who are needy and helpless
he once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around
the lack of water also mad it difficult for him
the mood created by the author was happy the love of cooking that is still with me today and for which i am eternally grateful
everyone has opinions what would be left without books
the author had literally put himself into the memoir as i read
as i stated in the first paragraph everyone has there own opinions
an article said too much computer using
it was breezy with shade from trees and rivers
just like books and magazines every one has their own taste in music
everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it
some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act but you cannot blame that on reading
they relax and entertain themselves in their own way
they can either play sports or even take a walk or run
we play different games in the playgroundthe laboratories are wellequipped
helps students do there school work
they just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts
whatever it be called book banning or censorship it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems
the snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought
i know a thirteen year old named
his mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope
the author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir
i have also experienced censorship in local library
now you can webcam people
students in high school to the after school with friends and get in to see rated movies parents
they make collections in the name of relief and misappropriate for personal benefit
nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing
also it allows people to talk online from far away places
the author explains were he lived as a child very vividly
this is due to their intelligent reading levels
also it teaches good that you might not have learned anywhere else
computers are a menace to society
she describes peaceful things in nature like the geese and hibiscus that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland
the very last line says i will take that test again
this is a very controversial topic
a lot of it is especially not for young children
being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds
so often today do we hear of books magazines and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views
i think that if we could focus on the factors in hand such as censuring we accomplish something no one else has
i think we should move these things to another part of the library that only adults can get to if that can be done in the library
you can say computers have a very positive effect on people or say computers have a very negative effect on people
censorship does need to occur in our libraries and i believe it should happen soon
this affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat
yet students manage to play
the school has even started doing something very new allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online
also people people have the right to choose what they want
this decision is now up to you
she found she was still to shaky to say the words at home lest the burst into tears again
we can learn something from any thing we read
children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home television and even at school than in some books
with a computer you can
in the middle of no where that is a problem
a musician is not just payed for his or her amazing skills with an instrument but also with his or her way to connect with the listener
when this failed the cyclist was even less determined
you can also do things while your on the computer hold your dog hold your cat eat drink text call
you can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power
well you could by chatting with them on the computer
it could be snowing and cold raining and of course wet hot and dry breezy and humid
this means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills
if they learn from these offensive materials then parents should teach them is wrong and is right
bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying
of people use computers for many different types of things
here are some reasons why i think that computers have good effects on people
you either go break out the old atlas or with a simple click of a button on the computer discover that the capital is
when you have friendship home and love everything will be perfect for you
most movies magazines music and books are considered offensive to at least one person in this world
i love to read during the day
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it
she got a we also be able to see whats going on with the and different place
do you really want to act that way to your family
when the hibiscus is budding then she will attempt the test again
so why should those things be
another time the author is grateful is in paragraph
the author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist
this would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy
when my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on and ended up calling him minutes later
in my opinion computers can be entertaining and educational but should not replace everyday living
well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings materials and movies
but it is the reading which brings perfection about the subject of concern
computers have very benefits
this means that years from now the world addiction to computers could be at or greater
you probably used to do what little research you did them
clearly computers have become a part of every day life
she intends to retake the drivers test
when you exercise you have tons of energy to anything
i strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves
i know that libraries were created to be information
kids are maturing at a much younger age these days
sometimes what children read they will say it or they will do it
the reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now
many schools call these books magazines and movies
also you can use specific programs like or to create a cover page for a project or a presentation for your corporal business
my last reason is you can make friends
being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive
and it helps you with your school work home work research of a country place house vacation you can do lots of things
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclists mood towards the rider
family is very important in life and some people take advantage of it
it sounded like everyone worked together there and helped each other out
this affected the cyclist by making him tired
if you want to achieve a goal you can mange that
what you see or read can really have an affect on you
the games kids play could help them learn more
if parents would be responsible for taking action their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf
some people do not think before they speak or do something
one of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away
so i along with some of my friends went to the okhla lake
computers hurt people in many ways
should people have the right to remove books music movies or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person
example if i have a project i find the information on about people or places
many abandoned factories the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones
overall the things that we read watch and listen to not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it
for example you can play games
they give me great joy
well you had a computer you could go online to the news website and read more
i think that computers detach people from reality create false personas and has no physical benefit
it helps people because they could projects
i think people should be able to have a choice
computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology
in conclusion computers are horrid for people
dear the computers are out
it will take longer to get a reply but its still worth the wait in the end
my answer to you is to not just throw everything out that be offensive or that you might not want your child to see
movies books magazines newspapers music and much more flash and sell more than they should
how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family
i think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it
in this case people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting
the bactrian camels have two humps
these features in setting are cruel
on the internet you can even ask questions and they will probably be answered
with any of these materials it should all be available to you in a library
they could be all over the internet the next day
there is a small garden in front of my house
after reading this paper you will agree with me that computers are a benefit
it bothers me it really does but there is one question i always risk myself how do i stop
online you can go on any website and talk to people
computers and technology benefit us in many ways
this sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone
i could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling
these people need to learn have the will power to get off the
for example when the terrain turned to hills the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy
computers can also improve your hand eye coordination when you type
this is why i believe the author of winter hibiscus ended with the specified paragraph
some people agrees that it benefit the society and others disagree
there is more foul language in music as it progresses
how would you feel if you did that to someone
dear being at home with nothing to do
also if you somewhere faraway you can watch videos about that place
the author concludes the story with this paragraph for various reasons
but mainly because of the recent issue
he should wear clean clothes
finally you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach and listen to some music next to the salty ocean
please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers
they should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room
the children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members
i mostly draw pictures of people animals and birds
do you think the downsides really outweigh these positives
i agree that computers do benefit society because every one uses one or has one it helps you with important stuff the computer makes things easy
censorship is one of them
the flower makes her happy and reminds her of home
with any of these reasons computers are really benefiting our society
next there could be a totally separate building for the offensive material
the most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people
using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper
books your in a library its many book that children decide to read that not be suited for their
dear local newspaper name is in the grade in in
this is a place that has already been through a and has fought against racism and slavery
computers help people of age first computers let you chat with friends and family
i found myself obsessed with it
they can open a whole new world to learn and be entertained but also a world of inappropriate items
a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers
it all depends on what kind of things are in the books music movies and magazines
when they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there
there is no true way to hide reality from the world
but for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts
the story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
all of these make the cyclist start to give up hope
the question is should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries
computers take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it
this allowed us to email another school
also can we please start using normal books instead of online ones
she simply understood that wanted to check out and return one
well now its this advance machine called a computer
most of these books are not trying too promote these things but they are just part of the story
so lets recap on what we learned
there was an announcement
books use words to display important parts of a story and our history
we should plant more trees to keep the air fresh
lastly you basically do anything on a computer
the mood in this story was security and happiness
there are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends
look for something else more interesting to you
this can educate others in to knowing that if you do this then this is the result good or bad
but i am happy that i could learn to ride at last
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant
all of these factors create something new in the cyclist
many people do not like a policeman because he is rough
also authors and directors need to be able to express themselves
so if you want to get more of an education but you have to work too
this made him more dehydrated
to find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more
when your on your computer for several hours you tend to got sucked in and not interact with anyone
experts you do not need to worry
more than people in the world have computers
he is being introduces to crude language sexual behavior and criminal acts in the minute time period it takes to listen to the full song
this last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again
it what you wants no need
by looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it
those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad
everything you read in a book is because the author wanted you to read it not to just put it to fill in or to be nasty
they were full and she wanted to bake something traditional for them
what do you do when you want to know what the capital of is
in conclusion the computer is essential to our everyday life and without the computer our people would not function
furthermore computers help talk with other people
in conclusion censorship is a concept that has its place in society but must be used very carefully
i have many friends in school with whom i play during my lunch break
it is no different when it comes to books movies and music
no for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was they will not understand it
jobs use them everyday connections are made by people and education grows because of them
so we people say that the computer
if your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family
an ideal citizen is a thorough gentleman
the music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment
on the other hand i am not saying that we should be lining shelves with magazines either
i mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy
the censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the we have total freedom of the press
exercise is a main way of staying healthy
decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views
there is games you can play quizzes you can take and you can chat with your friends
without books people would not be where they are today
his health issues started to get worse
first family friends can communicate from a far distance
dear newspaper you know that over of own computers
no of course not this just means that if something offends someone from their local library stay away from it
for example a teenager say while typing a paper that she really likes to write
humans that have to much on time on their hands
now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image
computers bring my family together by we rent movies from on the computer
this method is widely used today in the modern world
in fact nearly of people have an account on a computer of a public website live or
some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word sentence or even a thought
everyone has an opinion
i disagree on you part
but what if a close friend moves away
camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends
they could do this in a variety of ways including making new friends and adjusting to the area
therefore you should not ban books because it demolishes your individuality and it makes you conform to what other people want
the descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey
there is also the compromise
for example books that would be found offensive to children should be kept away from where children can pick out things in a library
it was once said you can not know your present without knowing your future
lastly you will be able to find everything you look for
government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world
dear people of many hours a day do you spend being active
leave that choice to
this shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting
offensive is only used in the first part but not in the second and the same material was used
would you want someone judging your belief or opinion
he should take a bath every day
in my opinion i would say no
some books have violence and crimes others have love and romance
like i said before one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it
and will forever be an on growing matter in problems around the
also no direction is another big one
i was talking to cousin on the account said his name but it was his wife
obesity in is at an all time high
the cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot
it will warn people that the book contain material that offend the reader of the book
it makes them have a meaning
the books that were found offensive should not be read at all
another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history
first of all in the story it says and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke
you can see computers are very much needed when it comes to school work
when was the last time you took a bike went camping or went to the beach
this is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist
when i found out enough information i would then be able to find the ten year old
second reason is computers make you smarter
however are all of these materials appropriate for all visitors
i do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive
if something is offensive to you you have the right to stand up for yourself
video also show a way do express what you feel and sat it in comedy horror or sad videos
lastly when all else fails you can rely on the computer to make stressful situations seem less overwhelming
oh let me start with no
depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came tohis determination increases and decreases
it is basically part of our human nature
but it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read
dear people are using computers all the time but computers help us all the time in positive ways
they help you keep in touch with friends and save you money
your body will be unhealthy and out of shape
do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives miles away
your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh
she runs very fast and wins
what if at you job you need the internet
this can help people understand computers
statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong
well this is what i had to do
if you wanted learn about other places besides the one you live in you could find it on the computer
for example one day a few of family friends come over we were eating dinner
well its true and computers are a great source
as you can see i have stated many good reasons
this whole journey was all mental
overall think computers have a positive effect on people
but i figured it out she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car
so this are my reasons to support my opinion
though television is a very useful thing if we see it continuously it can affect our eyesight
being on the computer is not a bad thing sometimes
dear to or to it wrong to ban a book
my neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as
not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him
another reason why i believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this
but why should we have to have movies books and etc censored cause their little children every where
travelling in a desert is very difficult and dangerous
typing to long or to much can cause your fingers to lock up and it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain
now lets bring this letter to an end
they are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as war violence sex drugs and all sorts of other things
i do not have to be on computer websites like and here is why
if someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library should they be able to get it removed
computers have a negative affect on people
your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy off line
they not even know what the right or wrong thing to do is
also it is easy for me because i type like the wind after practice of course
a child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember
i think having books banned a not wise thing to do because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual
without computers everyone would not be able to get the education that they have a right to
when the road began the change the speakers determination did too flat road were replaced by short hills
instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team go out and do it
my family used to spend a lot time together but because the computer i never get to do anything with my family now
i remember when i was a little girl about years old and i always wanted to be on the computer
and my conclusion with all three reasons
computers make our lives easier
these stories teaches us life lessons
the author was likely describing his happy
maybe their going outside and getting exercise or their brains could be getting sucked into a computer screen
so our only option was the computer
the mother would be taking away what i like to read and watch
hey my name is and i have some things to talk about that people need to hear
it is unfair if nothing else
also the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink and not die from dehydration
as a child did you spend all of your time indoors and online
you can ask people question
my science teacher always wants assignments printed and how i do that with out a computer
censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem
his family always helped their friends and when family visited they always had a place to
why not let them challenge themselves in a good book that they got to pick out
parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not
if people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life
well i do not believe it is a good technology in our generation
how would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided
for example i read a very famous book called the of by
should i not care about what i am forced not to see
the books at the library are on a shelf and little kids grab them everyday so why cant they read them if there in their sight
maybe that will give some education
secondly i would like to say computers have a great way of creation
family members always around visiting frequently for dinner
your computer is making you stupid
at the first town the setting is shocking but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous
if a women walks in with her son or daughter and find a dirty nasty book about sex drugs guns and knifes
still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer
because the reason people read books is to learn
the dolledup bride accompanied by her sister and friends arrived walking at a slow pace
through most the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way
another issue i have is with sexual content being found in libraries
my mother has going for a weeks time and i am managing the house now
schools are the backbone of society
two the computer can help you communicate with your family too for instance
by changing him physically
but just like everything computers have their downside
from their inventory for censorship
so if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems
however one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school
the word serenity gives the affect of calm and peace
from different websites
they came from neighboring villages
her mother talked to her and then she felt better
without books movies and music what would the world be like today
those people know that books teach us and we need books to know is possible happened and might happen
as a child grows he will learn more about the materials that were censored
lastly in the future everything will eventually be run with computers they are the then now and later
this can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work
people might change their mind about going to that particular library if they find a lot of offensive things there
students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home
i was doing a water depleting
it is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing
in endemic areas people are prepared
this is also the cause of a lot of obesity
programs such as which teaches people how to speak a language are available on the computer
on the other hand the computer is a nifty device and can be very handy at times like if your need perfect directions or need a question answered
for example a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature
the proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also
a round the world have asked this or been asked this question
local newspaper i think that computers have a huge affect on people
for the first couple of weeks i felt like an outcast like an outsider looking in
to conclude the author used many examples to explain to readers the love that was shared in his home
now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries
i am against any material that are offensive to someone or something else
parents think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that be considered bad
some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills
you should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press
therefore he goes place to place to beg
people should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them
that goes for movies music magazines books and more
i barely talked to anyone unless it was through email
people are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else
there has been incidents where that person did something illegal and then had to face the harsh consequences for that action
i think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going
they are so much fun to play and what i am talking about is video games
as we all know there are things like books picture and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see
they are making people fat not getting there exercise eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology
i strongly believe that all people should use a
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and gratitude
that was a thoughtful choice from as well instead of announcing it on news
the cyclist is biking through deserts
behind some movies or books there is are violence and bad scenes
spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels
using a computer will help us in life by talking or making friends on line
he could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl
censorship is a growing issue in the
everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate
finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online
if we allow people to censor what we read then how can we say that their is a book for everyone to like
there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen
i think the memoir is a very heartwarming story of a family that loves one another and his thankful that they have a place they can call home
then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated
therefore i do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries
the many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways
family to him that he be learned is not just his parents sisters and brothers
or maybe a local gym
i believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work
you can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes
firstly i believe that computers offer a wide variety of educational options
this type of material should only be given to an older audience
these are the moods the memoir created
these computer websites are allowing anyone to talk in people who could have the interest in mind
the decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader not the government or library or activist group
finally i think the computers are great benefits society
it is up to the kids not to read them
libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive
so if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside
most of the time the true facts will always be there
there is a thick line if a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not
many of times right that can be accidental or on purpose
there was a limited amount of water in the bottles
every book out there has something bad in it so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books
it just depends in what ways censoring is used
have you ever needed to cancel a meeting
computers can take you around the world without leaving your room
the author also shows how close their family is
censorship should be a matter of the private not public sphere
he uses every offensive language known to mankind
computers are very helpful in many of ways
we had to find certain books in our school library using this system as an assignment
i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway without paying a fortune in money to go the
the libraries are organized into section by categories of books
in conclusion people might say that taking out book is better than keeping them
i have a friend who is always on the computer
it took her a lot to move to but was glad did
all she needs is time
i think that we should not take them out if they are offensive
the cyclist describes the land when he says flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
he says in the story the speed limit was
most everyone uses computers
each day more kids are getting addicted to the computer
instead of being on the computer join a sports club
they are now always inside on their computer
some of the features were it was hot high deserts and no water
when the road get bumpy he gets tired
the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist in a negative way
many books have things people disagree with but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech
the author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as tumbleweed snakes and lack of water
they can also help people get a better education
so why should we have censorship
people never want to lose relationships
lastly they allow people to communicate quickly by an email or an
lastly if children become addicted they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework
lets make these profanities go away on their own
they would rather go on the computer
all in all computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the
nature is a beautiful thing
most modern day book movies music etc
libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it
the author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story
the setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist
before someone decides to but something they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price
the girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad
he decide he was going to such on a couple of pebbles
that of people benefit from using the computer
dear local newspaper computers are harmfully effecting the children and they are going to effect generations even more
lastly computers allow people to chat with other people
i personally think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy loving content mood
it cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds not to mention communication
even science has proved that trees are as necessary to our atmosphere as our food for life
school work is a very important thing in teenagers lives and i feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities
what do you expect us to do call them
there would be nothing to write about without imagination
with the recent earthquakes in and
everyone loves staying on the computer
removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it
there are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things
the parrot is quick in coping with what others say
from learning to games to videos and to a tool that is very useful
there for computers are time consuming should not be used
but we have to computer become we have to because we need
either matters just let happen what happens someone will learn from there experience so why banned now
the time is now to understand the full benefits of computers
the tone the author gave out was joy
in conclusion in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race gender or religion
for one you cannot run very long you become weak and for kids you stop growing
if someone of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion then they have an option to not read or look at it
this can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines
in conclusion i believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book movie or off of a shelf is not very smart
books music movies and magazines are all a form of expression
that is why i think those books should be taken out of all libraries
songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about
after reading the book i might not have enjoyed it but it was my choice to read it
but of this will happen if you stay on your computer
i truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker
then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone
but they have disadvantages
this is not the case
the project was a breeze and i got a perfect score
the movie and song rating system is a form of censorship i believe to be needed
the trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers
a library is safe haven
just because one might not believe in what a story says it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden
this quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents
for example in we just finished reading the book of
the pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves
most families however do have computers
also computers help deaf people talk
i that i would feel a lot better if i went for a run instead of going on the computer
that is how the setting affects the cyclist
computers are beneficial in several ways
books are good to read
in conclusion i think that this could go both ways
its quicker and easier
first of all people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising
this statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding water was very hard to find and scare
books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together but should be put in a section made for adult readers only
lastly it distracts kids from household chores
there are people out there who are actually addicted to the internet so they have to pay thousands of dollars to get back to health
in my opinion i think that computers help people
dear local newspaper i am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people
when maybe they through them giving a presentation much easier
this can be stopped if we all join together
its rude for it to be there
we have a live chat on or even
people need exercise to live
every other kid got a or above but since i was not use to writing it affected my grade
from ants to its all there
i can see these questions flying through heads of great people
i know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things
the millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about t other places and times
for example you can shop online and google things
dear local newspaper opinion on computers is that i think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly
sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing why would we put them on a self to be publicly displayed
music is a persuasive thing and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing could be bad
kids should be able to read what they want to read
i myself love to use the computer but i make sure to get off after about an hour
the soldier may be in the army navy or air force
i agree with computers do produce a positive impact on children
they need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up
to our whole life we will have to interact and socialize with others
debates are a main part of our society today
the way i see it is family and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important
but most people spend to much time on the computer
also gives me about a college that i would and like to attend to
he tells of the hardship of the sacrifice they went through
then on he wised up and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling
they showed me with their lives and these teachings have been the basis of my life
how the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting
true children are encouraged to have fun but to a certain but safe extent
without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have
in the very last sentence it is noticeable
since computers have become such a popular thing i think that in the future typing or using a computer will be in the
also my views on censorship in libraries
money be the most vital thing in our society right now
later these children will be able to chose for themselves they think is acceptable and the censorship can end
or talking with someone and you wonder what something is or means
i think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves
finally if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it
if she is tempted by something from home she will not take it because it will make her sad
the more people get computers the people exercise
you could tell that she is happy and grateful for her parents
my last reason is that computers are the general health of people today
all you do is type in what you need in a search engine and
if a parrot is reared in a house no outsiders could get in
we should have them every day
it amuses and excites
and your an learn a lot from computer
as a person i am well associated with my mind and it desires the freedom of choice
all of the previously listed things are rated
if you take a break go on you relax simple games put out a variety of websites
they say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do
they help us learn pass the time and it can all be manage during a certain amount of time
if you removed everything that offended anyone it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves
think of your family and how much you love them
taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people mostly kids from information that would benefit them no matter in what way
all in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports
for example gay and lesbian marriage peoples thoughts and opinion on this topic
why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school
this just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship
i think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess
at a local library you can find hundreds of books all of different matter a different style and of different stories
this mood is great and shows anyone can be happy
the features of the setting in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affected the cyclist
some people have an arid fear of change
the books and magazines can give people some ideas of what they say or do and they can believe anything of what they say
the author was speaking very proudly and happy about her parents
finds out a new website there going to tell there friends and there going to pass it on and on
there are not as many people taking care of our planet
in almost all cases library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library
in a world where we are raised to kill creativity i find computers to be part artistic
elephants are very strong and powerful
also when the cyclist went through a terrain change
teachers are telling us this while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be
his book taught me a few things and made me think different about people
almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions
some would say yes to this and others would say no
for example you might love the computer but that love should not over power your time you spent with your family
also your not exercising while on the computer being active keeps your shape along with being fun
everyone reads different kind of books whether its mystery romance or bible based books people read
but this perked my curiosity
we should also pray to god for a good day
i makes them blind to enjoy nature
people need them for research and projects
he weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
and when he saw the factory and stopped
there are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them
my ideas to me are good ideas and i feel like we can put libraries into good use around this county and
obviously the later of the is much more reasonable
i think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents
its faster than skimming through twenty books
all freedoms are taken away by that one word
believe me it was not easy
in conclusion the effects computers have on people are very negative
determined new beginning symbolism each are reasons why i believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph
no they not use computers more
for example research projects study tools and essays
we also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road
we are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see but we can start to eliminate some of them
i believe this because when its long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he cant keep pedaling
your already sitting anyway so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself
meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another
its your choice what to get not theirs
in my experience as a computer engineer
not go and try to get it shut down
so people can see what the author has to say
years ago people would have killed for this power for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to
just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library
as a student computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done
this reminds me of last when i went to cousins house
as he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face
you should be with your family and and friends
in experience mother has taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age
should taking books music and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned
there are books that children or young adult should read and should not read
thus our outlook is widened
they complete us all
the memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving
i do have to say computers are a cool device but there has to be a limit
also there are and various more
you should be outside enjoying the fresh air and playing sports not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen
you get addicted then you will not do your homework then your grades will drop
computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise lack of family and friend time and lack of enjoying nature
you depend on your computer to teach you about the world you should cease this use
a lot of books and movies great ones even contain some offensive content but they are classics
as you become more dependent on your computer you become less dependent on family and friends
its also good for business men because they count on computers for all there files
computers can also help us in school
minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours you get a glimpse of a very interesting title
the mood for his story is bittersweet
since are than our cable provider we were able to look up
the world needs people who challenge ideas and religions
it maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie but it could happen
people have the freedom to choose whether it is books magazines movies or music
how would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as did you say to me
in studies in out of who spend their time or more hours are wearing glasses
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills this characteristic is a setting like the others negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder
the business side should be more then enough for me to convince you
could even change their lives
milk is taken from the cows the milk is also taken from sheep and goats
what is offensive to some not be offensive to others
children learn by hands on or watching other things
readers of the censorship in libraries should never be an issue
when he first begins his trip the road is fine so he becomes confident
when the rough road affect sign appeared the travel then become more difficult
you can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing
if its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent
now to parents with children
also if the person is still a child there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material
those things might be offensive to them but not to other people
see i told you that they can ruin your life all it takes is a couple of hours to like the computer
this put him at a great risk for dehydration which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten
expressing what you think about a certain topic
i know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time
how do you meet people from different countries
however people not agree with me but what if your child was in dangerous
he should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own
throughout rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist
it creates hatred against other people
with the help of internet i was able to see a far away place and experience the country as if i was there
many people take this as a serious thing
so it was a very good mood the wrote the in
without this we would have no communication with him
the marketplace is always crowded
certain books movies music and magazines are all about those three things
as a personal example i can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized
this are my three ideas to the news paper article
almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside
you just have to know how to be safe online if not the computer can be a very negative object for you
but if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten
why would you wait letter from your cousin
or listen to music there are websites for them also
me personally am faster at than writing
was returning the book that had just read and checking out the new one had already picked out
for instance my little brother plays baseball my parents signed him up online
at some places they are used to carry heavy loads
i think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons
i remember when i was working on a project about
there is a small garden around the home and one side is facing a paddy field
he biked to the first town but it was like a ghost town
also libraries can do many things so that certain contents not be near others
obviously will do much more harm than good
and when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to
i think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because has bad things online
stop being lazy and get out
do you have a computer
meaning its really hot
it is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content
in the we have the technology of a computer
this shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist
thank you for your time
and were you can buy the crap to make them
in many libraries i know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children teenagers and adults
its proven that students who use computers from schoolwork they make learning easier as well
what about a doctor you would want to know how many years of college and med school are required to get your medical degree
do you really want to be the one to take it away
they talk to kids until they find out something like an address phone number school and district
we will all end up dies in the headlights
when i think of a computer i think of typing or a keyboard
stuff like that should not even be published in a public area
movies too if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it
if a movie is rated it should not be in a public library
that started slowing him down
eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom
there are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society
then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer
my last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home
if we were to take down all of the movies that are offensive to a person all the movies would be taken off
it was a flat land than rolling hills
when people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read
for centuries people have been writingmaking videoand all types of music
another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in
at this point i ask you the computer worth everything we think it
so in the other words the computer is useful for students
they also allow you to do research
the features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways
the features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert
but then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself
these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you
most of our daily homework is on the computer
what even happened to cellphones you can take
in society people are going to talk to write to sing to listen
have you ever been reading something that made you mad
because it quit its amazing and its a large area
life continues no matter what the hibiscus will return again in the spring
people these days are taking things way to far with their opinions
the mood created by the author in my opinion is a happy mood
he feels more confident and can ride to his destination
to more on i will explain what i mean about being with family and friends
the heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty
when people sit in front of a computer screen all day only getting up to grab something to eat people will because obese
my brother feel so uncomfortable with that book he decided to take it back that same night
so the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways
there are so many websites that make it fast and easy
he is strong tall and a healthy man
we are also taught how to correctly cite and research work
with computers anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else
in the reading it says flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
well if you answered yes stop the computer madness and head on outside
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
which is more important to you family or computers
throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had
there are three reasons why i argue this topic
advanced coordination would mean that person would able to accomplish more things like fast typing
the law of censorship is usually broken in libraries
first it be a book movie or magazine that someone plans on reading
so go and limit the time you on computer
this is why most endings are meaningful like this
by using computers rather than interacting with them you are the connections you have
this include learning about people
over time computers have caused most people to be lazy
computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school
this affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up
all of this talk about computer being bad for society really got thinking
my family friend had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer
all they worry about is winning the game
children do not choose their parents
that was one great comment from time
most people use these web pages to research for papers trips or even just to find out random information
so no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read
you can make web polls much more
there is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children
when she first sees it its blossomed
i like my house very much
this is what could happen if people are using them
he is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird
he states tumble weeds crossed my path
it shows love and respect to the guests and welcomes visitors
with out his life is impossible
computers are making people shut out their families
these are some of the reasons that i and others love computers
opinion is computers are bad
water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water
two weeks ago i took my year old niece to our local public library to find her a book
you are always thinking about just that and no other things in life
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm
but not the kind i was used to
makes the story happy by saying how great it was to grow up with his family
the children are the future of the world
and would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet
there are games that come with the computers and a lot of games on the internet
the cyclist felt black humor due to the features
i would say we keep it our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it
i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends
without computers i would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as i can with computers
do i think objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or taken off the shelves
there are sites such as can or
he also fells alone i toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path he also
but magazines are different they show like the styles and life stories of others
everyone is entitles to what they believe and others have to have the maturity to accept that
some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education
people should always treat others the way that they would like to be treated
we need to put a stop to this abuse of computers
i strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in
different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because offends one person should not happen
once again i would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good
there are few moods created
nobody wants to read lies do they
no matter what someone is offended or upset over something
just the other year the librarian whom i stay in constant contact with asked me if she should take the book off the shelf
books are written for two reasons allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors
things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available
it does this because while playing games people watch the screen and click with their hands
in conclusion the conflict of this story was set up by the setting
another cause why books or magazines be removed from the shelves could be that the send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content
those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items no matter the subject
in we have the right to speak our minds
that is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read
whenever i get free time i read books and i enjoy it
have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching
for example a teenager would be on the computer who is making fun of them
you never know the people could be messed on in the head
there is also caring and selflessness
teenagers are teenagers they must have technology
i think all these things affect him
in conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit
the computer looking at hotels and booking thou this modern day technology has brought many humans to places they wanted to go
the youth of the present will one day be the engineers doctors scientists and moving leaders of the future
a lot of the contradicts what i have been taught
as you can tell the difference in setting plays its crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply
getting work done can sometimes feel like another chore
some books that are intended would be better off staying in the library
computers learning by let vast of information being available
no book should ever be taken off the shelves
that is as simple as just going out and purchasing a computer
they had to do what they thought was best for their children
in our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes
in the current day and age the environment is a growing concern
with a computer you can organize it all
in my opinion i think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons
but with confidence determination and the relief of the success he was able to overcome the obstacles
also when you try to multitask with the internet
i think computers are one of the greatest inventions ever
people think that this scene is to provocative and another person look at that and say there is nothing wrong
the author of winter hibiscus ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes
censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries
you get facts reviews about the place
in fact almost say they spend more time on the computer than anywhere else
many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them but most agree that friends is one big factor
to take one book away is to take all of them away
i hope you too heed to my advice
when he reaches the end however he finds water
adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them
without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments print out pictures and getting information
everyone expresses themselves in their own way
it is his own writing style
that shows that the house had to be comfortable to him if he calls at home because a home is a place for someone fells safe and comfortable
music people say has its effect even on trees plants animals and their growth
i know that many people pay their bills online
he understands that they only left for his benefit and he appreciates that
students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work
not everyone that goes to the library wants to just sit and not talk to anyone
what would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike
i believe that book should be kept in order of age
computers are positive because of the new technology
they say that it’s the fastest toy car they have ever seen
there immune system making the risk of getting sick greater
and finally many people have found their careers through the internet
dear i believe that computers have a positive affect on people who use them
you newer know what would happen
for example in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland
not for me but for you
many agree computers disadvantage many people in their own way
also people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer
he is kind gentle and courteous
some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions
this is where one realizes the important things
they can help contact friends and family from all over the world
many trees provide us medicinal products such as quinine and eucalyptus
in conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist
in this writing my goal was accomplished i wanted to let everyone know that the whole thing is getting a little out of hand
those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically
people need to see their always not going to get what they want in life but they need to move on
his daughters are students of class nine and seven
what if you want to talk to a friend
everything is not all bad it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it be
he teaches us english
i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas
computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees
classifying something as offensive is an opinion
were made it so your basically always within minutes of a teacher
you can also learn about different people and places
here is a quote from the article
before the beginning of the were starting to be discriminated against
first i will be talking about how people use computer too much
also depending on how long you are on the computer for
so yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book etc
enjoying nature things and you that
that is why we should have computers and use more
to me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying
lastly a computer is another resort to go to when trying to accomplish something because there is always something on the internet that will help you
not only is that education but that also helps the environment because you would be saving paper
but another reason is that begging has become quite a paying profession
every one has there own opinions and there own view on things
i had to go see a shrink to get over those thoughts
one reason i am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology
and then she states that their wont be any books left for us
this shows why computers are bad
now what do you believe
the second people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people
all students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends
it comes to my attention that computers have over time
this is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads
this is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age
there are so many different means of communication using the computer which are all free
after school many teens and adults go rushing to the computers for all different reasons
in terms of race and religion everyone is considered equal but in terms of level of everybody varies from one another
on the subject you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation
this is him showing that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them
you cannot show foreshadowing or show the anger
but there was mud everywhere
sometimes i enjoy reading books where people get hurt and sometimes killed but someone else reads itthey might think that it is horrible and very offensive
our eyes are looking while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard
she will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted
if someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers many new readers would never know this book
why did the author have to throw this in the book
i understand if everybody thought it was really offensive to take it off but not just one person
when it is too warm out it makes it more difficult and more inconvenient to ride
computers have a positive effect on people
i think people should get their schoolwork done and get off
in conclusion i have given you great well thought out reasons why the computer benefits society
finally they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle
computers are good for finding information quickly
more and more people are neglecting to spend time with their loved ones to get to the next level on wars
the most important function of the computer is education
nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them
this is a good thing because then no one will get and everyone will be happy
soon there is great rush at the taps
games are great to get your mind going
also most of kids parents can contact their teacher and email them to see how they are doing
what with all the fun stuff you can do who can blame them
this is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out
your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education
it does not grow every whereas the mango tree
the setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically
in the essay the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting
heat abandoned roads snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist
they are constitutionally protected in the things they say
it can make what any seam a hard time into a good just by finding your loved one
therefore we get fresh
this will give her more time to learn study hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home
everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end
without exercise one become obese develop diabetes or heart problems or even have muscle troubles
there are many opinions on censorship in libraries
because the towns were deserted the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water
kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything
we learn so much information from all sorts of books
people can do grocery shopping from the home they can order pizza online and they can go shopping online
some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future
as he continues forward he notices that there are no buildings cars or people of any kind
well everyone knows the same old question do babies come from
where would businesses be without computers
after a while he starts to get tired
the roads were damaged due to the heavy and continuous rain
another simple fact is that the constitution that we have the freedom of which basically means we print and read whatever we want
but some of these movies have offensive language and some appropriate scenes that kids would want and learn how to do those type of things
i think having computers are good because you can use it to find places
but yes i think that there should be any kind of magazine movie or book at the library that you need
also it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation
i think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library
everyday the teachers would give an update over his computer
by keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she came from
if he would have been bitten he would have died
but sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter
face it forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the faith will not be stood for by the reader

introductiona proverbits meaning literallyexamples to explaintimely action neededthe ship and the crewconclusion
they help students catch up or fully understand something
and when they read bad things like that they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives
this last paragraph is written for several reasons
that could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble
events such as that are the exact reason why i think that almost any book belongs on the shelf
this shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person
this memoir is indeed heart warming and touching though it is very inspirational
computers are they lot us chat with friends and family
just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild
when the author says how his parents cooking was passed on to him he cuts away from the article specifically to thank his parents
we saw the industrial progress of these countries
it is taking away the knowledge for our children
then after that i can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out see
when i got home i went on the internet and researched it
remember minutes of exercise minutes in the sun each day to stay really healthy
we have freedom of speech for a reason
and maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer
computers are not a bad thing but its is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health
do you ever miss your family that lives in other states
the hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water
my final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries
if there even was one book that someone found discriminating or offensive they could always just pass by it and choose one that suits what they want
i agree with kids and adults not having time enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
kids rely on them for studying or homework
at times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits
i have had my experience with books who are offensive to me
the sun was beginning to beat down
finally computers can be useful for schools and work
this depression needs to stop
have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining
does everyone you know live in one are
if you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you
the whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope
the ending also gave the most meaning
it should be up to the children what they read
the more kids read about this the more they think violence is okay
finally you use the computer for educational use
i remember the first time i tried to use the it difficult but as i tried more i got better
without the water he could become very weak and dehydrated
because of this it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions
in some ways censorship is necessary and in other ways some people just want attention
like learning about far away places and people
last you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone
can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them
then again if you think about it maybe not so simple
this story was truly filled with dozens of examples of love and comfort and i really enjoyed reading it
i can relate this to my brother with his dis
first staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body
i soon found out yes they were
my father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages
i use to be a computer geek
seeing these things in books movies magazines and etc
if i find something offensive i try not to pay attention to it
once again i do believe computers can have a positive effect on people
a lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers
books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them
some books are good some are bad
thus the order becomes a habit
inside the library there are rows of tables and chairs
i know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all
if you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems
the effects computers have on people is good for the most part
anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays
libraries should present a wide variety of books movies etc
secondly are fun to read i know they are
until she start losing her her job
this is another reason why computers are bad
in the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert
i believe had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation
the children might be reading books that are too explicit for their age
do you use a computer
if a person wants to check out a book that is offensive they should be allowed to check it out and read it
that is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact
it is located at the other end of the library
is a lot of positive things about technology especially computers
the advantage in technology has provided many new ways for family and i to communicate with each other
helping that child find what they want a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child
this is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did
computers can help open people up to unique genres of music they have never listened to before
if we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature
however believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise in perspective
she is afraid that her parents are going to be mad at for not passing the test therefore she buys a flower that she sees for it remind
that way more time can be spent outside in the open and less inside staring at the screen all day
what the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it
this is what i think the mood of the article is about in the memoir
next the web is also used for keeping in contact
depending on where you are the restrictions be more or less harsh
in this paragraph i am going to tell you about why i think that people should other things than going on the computer all night
dear editor of the i believe that computers are good ideas for our community
the authors parents risked so much for their son
the author in this memoir created a mood that showed how felt about this house and his parents
the author said that he would never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things he learned there about how to love
in the times a statistic shows that of students in the find computers there best studying tool
there are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves
i believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages races and genders that some censorship should be put into effect
without computers i never would have learned so much about that place
and then we have no books left on the shelve for any of us
many sites amuse us and we should make use of that
and it can teach you things too
the next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents
we have made pornography an easily obtainable thing and music that promotes sex drugs violence and alcohol
the theme of this story could be seen things discourage you
he only says the good things about them
the movies are easy to find
i think we need our computers
the author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well
the computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world
there were many men women and children going to see the fair
the author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together
writing is a form of expression
first thing is that computers are having a effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing
and another thing why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them
for one they help in our educational processes
first people are not interacting with family and friends
that will happen it is almost natural for it to happen
if one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books
books can be a magical place for children as well as adults to go and create their own world
these symbols are important to her in that they give her a chance to start over and she sees that in the winter hibiscus
can be found offensive
now i will move on to my second reason
this is my opinion on computers i hope you agree
do you think computers are helpful
i truly believe that the planet would be better with out computers
kids will still fight and rough house
the charmer was a middleaged man
the settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood
the states that freedom of speech religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged
we all have it we just need to start using it
she has a different feeling with her problem
my year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children
whether a book is being read about or the there is always something influential to be read
is where about half of the libraries money is being made
when they are expected they do not cause much harm
i believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side
the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well
i hope you agree with me after reading this
and yet i was full of apprehensions
i have two things to say about it
you would also be learning about their culture
sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen
planing a vacation is a trough job to do but what if that job could all take place in our sport
have you ever heard of online colleges
computers are good for everyone in this world
that many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative
it makes the the people who would like the items that have been censored mad
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
a freedom of thought and a freedom of press present within our nation and increasing in presence around the precludes the idea of this censorship
right now our economy is not doing to well
computers make research easier to find and they organize data well and quickly
she went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her
they support the life of living beings
libraries have books that are short long and everything in between
if they work on computers during a long period of the day head home to spend more time on the computer whats that doing to your body
the use social networks allows kids to put all their information there for anyone to see
this goes for anything else like furniture instruments or even cloths
i over heard two girls talking
the mood created by the author is outstanding
out kids use the internet to research things for projects
does it even matter what the owner wants to sell
people think differently from each other
computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop
computers it the more advanced technology so its the people is using it
people can even order groceries to new house if they are busy
i believe people have the right to readwatch or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws
i will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor
if a family with young children want to go to the library the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children
you just have time for friends and family
i do and are why i learn about places before i go is by looking that particular place up on the internet
dear readers has come to my attention that there is a debate on whether or not computers benefit society
i also give them gifts that i buy with my pocket money
especially pertaining to what books magazines movies and music almost all people are reading watching and listening to
people stop losing their focus on important and start paying attention on other things like the was a great person
three out four adults who used computers say that they help them with their work and social status
music has the power to say things and communicate with and make statements that could only be made by music
now we have violence
if you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life
webcams hooked up to the computer let people talk face to face with someone else they might not have seen in months
both of these things you can do without a computer
they help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home
but self control is the only way to avoid this problem
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
since most students are familiar with computers they enjoy working with them more than writing

thank you computer gods
the last type of game is the tower defense

they are too coming back getting ready to start their new life
he states the sun was beginning to beat down the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist
meeting and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom
it definitely benefits society
if a teen helps with a then they can ask a for help
first of all different people consider the same content differently and the titles being removed not be judged fairly
the internet can also be a time waster
he started getting desperate for water so he drank out of this hot water hole
if one read now between the lives it says more than just this
time flew very soon the two hours were over
for example or use technology to type in peoples orders and amount they pay
we went online to find things like
their are also on line like the and magazines like time
in the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill
also when i was in fourth grade i had to do a project on
like at any or any where there are magazines with ladies in there bra and underwear and its the same thing with the guys
she was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well
i strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people
sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups but usually they do not market to everyday people
he had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope
there are a variety of computer games
whatever you say on the internet can be read posted anywhere any site any time whereas in real life its really you talking
in more general terms the grants freedom of expression
by using the computer to complete research papers students save hours of scanning through books in the library and money on reading books
last computers are a waste of time money and effort
in conclusion this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph
the setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help
their motive to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location and to commit rape
so i want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions
so basic computer skills are important for people to have for new jobs and common ones you see everyday
just go on your favorite search engine and search your topic
books magazines and music on slavery are things i think we as a people required to read are things we are required to have
there are even music out there that only adults should be listening too
we all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read see or listen to
some drivers do not obey the traffic rules
i lost pounds by just swimming for a month
also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go
this bad of help can male school projects easier make students be even smaller and give opportunity to help in need
libraries always have some type of organization
music booksor magazines are okay to be in the library yet alone in the people it self
in which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty off the shelf
finally i think people should have to give up reading listening to watching or looking at things that be interesting to them
remembers how there was always someone at the dinner table and usually someone staying with them until they could get back on their feet
the author shows it by saying love of cooking
if this is a library no but if it is a library yes
everything you need to know is in a computer
but has that ever stopped me
he even came across a snake
use but you would need and it
even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way at that point he was out of water
there was a large snack in the middle of the road as the tumble weed blew by
but when they here that word or read about something or watch
computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other
we can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal because their could be reasons why things are where they are
they can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility
peon is a very important person in a school
also the beating sun affected him in a different way
when it comes to books in the library we should have sections
in conclusion no i do not think libraries should be censored
the rest room toilets parcel room and the canteen are few
these are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong
i do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express their self through art literature and even music
computers have a positive effect on people because you can find what you need in minutes
and how important he learned that family and friends are
my first reason is talking online
many libraries contain books movies music and magazines that can be considered offensive
phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets
after those girls left i went and got the book they were talking about
such as how many points got for your fantasy team
there are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone
also the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work
over all i think the mood is happy
many teenagers do this
if i were the cyclist gazing at the sign i would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead
many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun
as you can see computers have many positive effect on people
dear local newspaper opinion is yes people are on the computer to much
young boys are snagged early their futures now controlled by this disease
his parents worked hard for what they worked for and no one can take that away
he went through three towns that had nothing
if libraries began censoring their books much information will be disclosed for no one in the public to read
the mood in this memoir is loving and thankful and calm
if parents monitor their children closer they will be able to control what they are doing
same thing with movies and magazines
as a result the british have to give freedom to india
why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are
we go to the church to offer prayers and enjoy singing christmas carols
the cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads
this includes your family members or relatives etc
also your students computers get viruses because of inappropriate sites
unlike the winter hibiscus it took a while for the geese to become through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test
my answer is no for the reasons i have listed above
in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
in conclusion the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy
part of what make a good work great is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers
i also think the computers are helpful by talking to friends or family
if you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone
at the same these mane protests it from the teeth or claws of an enemy
then imagine that they snatch that book up and you never see it again
libraries are meant to provide information anyways
her mother never wanted to talk about him because she knew that this way only going to make matters worse
authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about
the first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the or the of your state
there is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive
five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book she read and enunciated every word in the book
my suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books
in my opinion everyone should have a right to go to the library and get whatever book magazine movie and music they what
the mood of the boy in this story was he was happy talking about how his whole family could come to his house for any meal in the day
if you have school work to finish computers help will work
it has violence language and people are treated in a harmful way
i study in cambridge school which is one of the best schools in london
i would give due place to cocurricular activities
if one needed directions to a place or if one wanted to know how to do something would show how to
when i walk into a library to look for a book i would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books movies or magazines
computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools
is one of the most popular chat groups on the internet is another popular chat group
he shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how hes going to die
if disliking the book is a problem then put it back
heat dessert humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey
people have humiliated others on the internet
the reason why i say that is because we should be able to but what ever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way shape or form
this could help them in the future if you need to type up an assignment for school a job application or college application
but they also can communicate to your friends and family
talking to in country is unbelievable
have you ever been looking for a book only to find it band from all local stores
people can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree
the settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of
when i was little i was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language
he suffers from no disease
so some people might like to learn about offensive things
computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations
because if is hilly he has to work twice as hard
i know that the population of uses the computer
and happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends
as i mentioned before the computer is beneficial to our education
every book movie magazine and any other thing should be left for people to enjoy and hopefully you can find something you enjoy too
we all sang songs of joy
then when spring comes and it blooms the flower could give her the strength to pass the test
if speed is what you need then you will look for a computer
life will become tough
although parents care about the things their children read books should not be banned
of the people who use computers are obese or overweight
spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life
however a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people
if someone wants a good bookmagazine or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get
the setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist
and computers do really break because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus
the books music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals
for example i read an article about the and the the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and i got
all of these are easily accessible by children of all ages
this is very bad for your health and body
sure some novels expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it
finally in paragraph it talks about how their arms and doors were open to anyone who needed them
another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought
for example a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man but a black man would consider it to be about his history
in addition they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction
whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer and play their favorite game
they have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them
it is just a matter of life
computers can effect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them
another thing is that is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff
yes i believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone
like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad
the movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then
another great thing about talking online is that i can talk to all my friends not just the one i am playing with
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things i learned there about how to love
it obvious that computers have a good effect on people
i can agree with there but i truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly
that content might be a whole other world for a young child
there are many more reasons libraries content should not be censored but here are three reasons that are obvious
maybe a bad break up causes someone to make a song
after about three minutes i was terrified
i feel like some educational magazines be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand seeing it will help them understand
so why should anyone else be able to take that away from them
computers help us look up places and things we never seen before and teaches us about them too
i think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me
introduction – change – professional – ideas – fashions and look – parties and pastime – conclusion
certain words help to better express people and their views
this extremely reliable and accurate
people rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body
you want to wast a nice sunny day by staying in doors hurting your eyes
an eight year old should not be able to go in and get a movie whenever they want to
much can be done as regards prevention protection immunisation etc
another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it
he thought that he was going to die
the people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read
another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too
the television shows are still being aired
the most important thing was bringing family and strong relationships into the house making it an actual home
is very important to have interactions with people
there is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books
going to college not everyone has enough time in a day to drive to school well with your computer you can go to school right online
they bring us information at amazing speeds
if you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it
there is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all
so after reading this i hope you understand why my opinion is what it is
if people started taking certain things out of there book stores libraries it would eventually get out of hand
i have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online
i am not complaining about this because i understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to
when i was twelve years old i started to listen to music that i enjoyed instead of the music my mother played
i mean you have to agree with me on this one the main reasons why people are becoming obese because of some kind of technology computers
there are also many books on the some people find that offensive or not want their kids reading about that but that is history
dear have many debated on whether computers are good or bad
is life filtered and censored
now you go out and make anyone that says computers are a horrible inventions you tell them exactly why computers are so important
people all over learn things on the computer each day
so the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him
everyone is different
also possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone what do you do then
he might learn tips from the magazine or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful
but every town the cyclist came to was deserted
people also spend way too much time using computers
if your not going to find a book there why go to the library anymore
they can also teach you about far away places
so i like to listen to my music while i am reading
but on the other feel that the if he can make their decisions in what is right
last is the day time
the rain caused water logging everywhere
how mad would your parents be
they split the white sunlight into its basic colours
in conclusion computers are used every day and help us greatly weather it be learning a new language or just talking to friends
another big problem is education
he helps me in grammar lessons and in return i help him in arithmetic
you eventually memorize where all of the keys are located
i consider it a sin to waste money on personal pleasures
there are educational websites to learn about things
the reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place
computer are also great because you can video chat with friends and family
it would not have something little children would want
teachers can have students do projects about different countries on people and the student can easily that the information on the computer
i think the advances in technology is a good thing
finally parents can set limits on what their own children read
but if you choose not to utilize the internet there are many programs that are very helpful for learning
there are also websites called online databases on the internet
working citizens use computers to help them with important jobs
the library needs to make itself user friendly
the main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer
racism is a very hurtful thing
she would keep trying till she got it right
not just about family and friends but the world too
paragraph the memories from the home make the mood loving and warm
computers can be a very good thing to have around
censorship would in libraries would not be the most best thing anyone should do
some classics are also being speculated against
many people have an addiction to technology you could be using your time more wisely and computers put your health at risk
as s result i use it for homework
obviously without computers life as we know it would be way different
if everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf there would be nothing left in the library
you can find just about anything on the internet these days
from the people who are gaining weight every day because the sit on the computer and chat all day
computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world a way to increase responsibility and helpful for education
it is because the sea is the source of all the water they use
its as if when the plant is ready to start budding she will also be ready
the internet is also a dangerous place and the growing computer use with maximize the problem
the planet should be explored not surfed in the web
you do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store
the child brought some fruit for me
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
the driver was badly hurt
even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie
everyone will have very good points on either using or not using censorship in the library
something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry
things that offend people for instance a book about or natives and how they were treated so poorly
but i also believe people can spend to much time on them
later on when i grew i was turned out i became a street dog
well i disagree with this statement
the first thing that affected his ride was the heat
the geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring
the most important use for computers is learning
how your might you can bark those easy to find everything becomes all that are locate
it smoothing up the vibe and if you be and a bad mood that music you like claim you down in put you and a better one
because he is in the desert on a long bike ride he is dehydrated
should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended
for example someone by accident stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials
because like i said everyone deals with it at one point and not everyone can be happy
thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty
it will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring
that can advance the knowledge of citizens
parents who have only daughters go on producing children until they have a son
then there is face book lets you see what people are doing that day
most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways
also attraction to literature would seize
think about it hour often you go outside
you cannot control what other people do or say
one mood that the author had was happy
learning is a good thing for adults an children
of the obese population in the die from a heart attack
it would be all the more reason for him to give up
no more books music movies and magazines
taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries
even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today
his father is very kind and religious
now days everything is offensive to somebody
which let me explain is
well i say we should because computers has everything you need as in info games school websites where you can by clothes
some books teaches them about the world they are growing up in
first off there are many skills you can develop on the computer
the mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family
my sister went to the kitchen and tried to some work
either way your learning
that is the main reason for libraries
without computers we could not be where we are today
this lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy
in conclusion the censorship of books magazines etc
finally the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication
in the morning when he began his trip he was eager and determined to get to his destination
this will help us later on in life also
i must admit i am not an avid reader on my own
at one point in the story she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories
if a student is nervous he can not learn anything
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit the setting often affects the character
the first and most obvious is the temperature it is hot therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty
who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring
there is not one movie book or magazine where everyone will approve of it
to conclude computers help people talk online
we all have library cards which we carry to school every day
so many people abuse themselves staying on to long
and your life will go by fast and you want notice it your all fat and old
however many people find different things offensive than others
no one should be aloud to take something away that is important to other people even if it is offensive
whatever the cause be they have the right to expose their children to anything they see appropriate
you should only be on the computer for minutes a day then go get some exercise
spending too much time on the computer is not healthy
libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public
most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence sex or drugs
censorship in libraries today i believe are not a big problem
computers have a negative effect on people
i came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier
also you can buy league or
if someone does not stop the harsh comments then it never stop
during the whole memoir the designer is happy
there are many great uses for a computer
she concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now
she was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow
please we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have
so my simple solution is obvious
where can you learn these
so keeping these types of books help other people who are readers
these express the passions and skills that followed the author to adult hood holding a special place in his heart
a library is a great place to be but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment
they give people a chance to learn things
if they do not hear about it in movies or magazines they are probably hearing about it at school
lastly computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience
on the internet people can find information about faraway places or people
people get lazy and changes while being on the computer an mount of time
these creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about
yes being on the computer definitely has a bad side
it is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads
was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and the man went through after his love died
i think the mood that is created by the author in this memoir is cheerful and welcoming
fortunately there was no loss of life
he thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love caring family friends and selflessness they brought into his life
advances in technology are amazing
in conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea
he goes from door to door to distribute the letter and moneyorders
clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be
the sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is could easily give up on their driving test but she wont
this proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances
this shows that it is hot because he is sweating
these days the computer is the latest hit
he is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep
most of the housewives observe it and they don’t like to kill rats
does it drive us crazy that they do
last reason is you need a computer to put music on your players
you can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government
if is unaware problems can only be helped to a short extent
this memoir did however express a lot of feelings though
you can take a trip and see your family
throughout this memoir there was moods of caring loving grateful happiness
you just keep pouring money into it which is just depressing
trees are very important to us
or even go to our local library
i prefer to go on educational scientific and historical tours also
i used the computer in the dark so now i need contacts
by using the computer you get the as a book and easy
we must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer
generally school children should have ambitions
every day we see how they struggle to keep us happy
everyone should be able to take care of themselves
those are some valid points on why i believe that books magazines movies and etc
i think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning
as i said before they can help people learn
certain people like certain types of books maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in
and i hope it sticks around for a long time
the setting of rough road ahead do not exceed the speed limit effects the cyclist in many was
fresh air is good for you you
they are more of a benefit than a burden
there are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting
the most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information
compare a person with a laptop to one without
books are divided into their individual sections according to truth kind and cover each category holding about four options
i have learned to deal with all of those things from books
besides water is a must for agricultural purposes
i know i would become angry if that would happen to me
if knew that they might cause their parents to diverse they might stop playing on the computer so much
this time could be used by doing more important things such as being with friends and family being outside with nature or exercising
if someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could effect their grades a lot
communication online has made huge impact worldwide
whenever a student needs information on a certain topic then they use the internet for help
being with your family is important because their fun go out with
computers even have webcams for video chat
he began to ride again
every single book magazinemovie and music needs to be left alone
he is a very good athlete
above and beyond all that new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees
he respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him
they can just over look these books and pick another
computers allow people to take online with other people
they want a change so you can enjoy life again
you can research people and places and or get pictures
children and teens need to be protected from this major threat
its not only kids either that are affected adults also are affected by the media
also anything can be found offensive by one party of people and so everything be offensive and removed
man does not live by bread alone
in a study it showed that of people in the world has a computer as a communication tool
does computers have an effect on people
this online behavior must stop people are getting addicted and gaining wait from the lock of physical activity
a lot of today are censored because of the content in books music movies and magazines
whenever i see them i wish if i were a bird and i could also fly like them
the cyclist was in a bad situation
that is normal thing that will up on computers they can give you viruses and people can get your personal information
in the internet every thing is more easy i mean all you have to do to learn how it works is to use a keyboard mouse
this way people get what they want and they have some time off of too
another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch
parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea
music if it has an sticker you have to be over to rent it
libraries can not censor their materials
dear local newspaper computers are a waste of time
boredom is bad because kids will do anything to stop it
i can see the headlines now watching movie cause them to be murders
the libraries are public and they are shared
my opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too
if you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic
censorship will block out inappropriate parts of books movies music and magazines in order to make these materials more suitable for all age groups
take about minutes to an hour of your day talk to those people you never get to see do your reach
which leading to death or jail
yesterday my emailed me a picture of a cub bear in a tree outside of his cabin he was playing in in for
you just gotten make that type of change
i found out that of kids and teens prefer online games to board games
as you can see the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story
this maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well
internet goes beyond teenagers on and
no i sure hope you would not but to some they see that as their one resolution
besides all of the good things computers do have bad qualities too
the citizens of have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong
computers are growing keeping is on top
parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want but some parents choose to wait
all they had to do me
could you imagine living in a wold
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was grateful in the beginning of his memoir
censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world
the computer only benefits you in a way
one term of communication that came out recently is
they asked him to make on thing after another
due to personal rights and what history has shown the world censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children
if someone wants to start a business their first stop is usually the internet
those books being the ones i would never pick up off of the shelf myself let alone allow my future children to pick up
someone should have to deal with wading through music like that
people need to get out side and get more active
explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him
he describes the snow melting and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve
some parents think they should be removed but others argue they should stay
we should teach people about them
just one computer can enlighten you with so much
children get hurt from doing
he ends up getting lost
but last sunday was different
another person enjoy that book and many others like it as well
if people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight
in one case a girl actually killed because of nasty messages posted about her
for example when i say games i mean educational games like reading games math games writing games etc
using the computer is not a good price to pay for you health
webcam is becoming a huge sensation
if you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun
to me that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home
taking things off shelves also has a good side to it
if someone finds it offensive then they can ask for that material to be put on the highest shelf their
computers are a great advancement in our technology
technology advances people are opened up to many possibilities suck information via the web unlimited socialization and simulations
having a vary in books music movies and magazines make what the library is a place to learn new things no matter the subject
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy
so in conclusion the should have know right to censorship books movies magazines music or any other item they have
you can also find directions to places sports stats and about different places
that being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework
first of all i think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected
we as people should not be able to take this right away from other people
first and foremost the use of computers will tribute to better research
millions even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers
do you love technology
learning the harsh realities of our society educates people allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them
you of course need a to do thank one
this shows despite what happened he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude
people have to adapt to different cultures if they move
she was bringing up good memories of her past life in her home
computers have a background of doing this kind of effect on people
when they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else
it was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty
the cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across
so they will decide whether or not they should have books magazines or music removed from the shelves
computers can have benefit society
i am here to say that computers are not the best way to benefit our society
also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him
in paragraph he also shows how life with his family was
are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books not their children
to conclude censorship be a disrespect to individuality personal beliefs and the overall joy of reading a good book
it makes fun of people who are unique in their own way
everyone has a right to read listen or watch what they want
they can have devastating influence no supremacy what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort
that is why i strongly believe that certain material such as books magazines movies and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries
it gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again
well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others
ducks were swimming in the ponds
we develop good qualities
the amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house
the unrated version or the censored version
libraries are made for all people and everyone has there own taste
lastly i think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers
without them there would be no books for anybody to read
in this memoir gives a grateful feeling
home as well as neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family
in addition to that there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer
another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together
also they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
in conclusion those were the reasons why i think computers has a positive effect on people
some materials found in libraries that be offensive to one person not be offensive to others
therefor a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual
these chunks of metal are expensive unhealthy and degrading human learning capabilities
computers are also needed to do research for school projects
another reason is that it shows strength
going off road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge
videos are great when your bored
in conclusion computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it
of all people found out about their job on a computer
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love for family
although they can be time consuming they make up for it in the long run
finally going out doing sports and starting fit is very important
on time it might take your just over a minute
so now you know that a computer helps you in the future
these computers help the students complete research papers typed assignments and other teacher requirement papers
the author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic
they could take it home and begin reading it and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them
this enclosed creature later develops in to a butterfly
he started out with a smile on the face
even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely
if you go on the computer at then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice
has a preference for religious books that explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of his religion
she had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic
when he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story
he joins us in games
we all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainments
then that one special book you wanted to read is now off limits
what can be done about this problem
i have come up with reasons to support my opinion
if your children are looking at things they should not be looking at you should keep you child away from that section
when people go on the computers they forget all about things they do
people spend way to much time on the computer
he wakes up at dawn and goes to the field
like say a high school paper
in addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends
dear local newspaper i think using a computer has become bad influence on modern society
overall the main mood of this memoir is loving
on the other hand if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted
also adults like to check websites for the news and to catch upon sports
i know what the feeling is when you are low of fluids because l have chronic dehydrated
one experience i can think of that is a good example of this is when i was years old
it is as if the sun were taunting him telling him that he cant make it
his message be carried on for centuries
they opened the engine and did some adjustments
the people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen too
i disagree with that opinion
there are a few mango trees in my garden as well
should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment
growing up was the wonder of my world
one of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not
sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor and then we learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them
i think that they should put some books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will like
no young child should be able to check out about full of shooting and fighting
this goes against all our morals
he was getting tired quick
they have kids fiction informational and many more
now i consider myself a young adult and i believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong
going over all those hills can really tire someone out
please think of what i have said and buy a computer
if we take that away from people then how will we all connect
it gives you a variety of things to look at or even check out
some might say means that the people of will be much more green
first the heat dehydrates and exhausts him almost causing him a heat stroke
the author made the relationship very close from everywhere
i have to admit i have watched listened to and looked at some bad stuff but i regret it all so very much so
seeing this plant again makes her remember memories from her homeland
in a time crunch situation like college or high school speed is everything
this is why i think computers are very positive
his spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water
this is an understandable point but who is the government to promote only what they want to promote
we should take a stand and get rid of these bad books
sometimes he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping
it warns us about natural disaster
there are things people will not agree with
this is becoming a problem all over our state and country
for example she likes bitter melon it says
lastly is a convenient and fun way to relieve stress by interacting with other users around the world
computers and modern technology are advancing quickly and more and more people are beginning to use them
movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path
in the end i got the game anyway
this is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as not complain about it
when it comes to libraries there are very few materials that should be banned
it revolves us as a whole and if someones starts taking off books who is to stop someone else from doing the same
i believe that children are the easiest people to influence
books and music should be removed if not used for something that is in good use
people these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be
different parts of the world experience different seasons at different times of the year
also computers have been a major part in entertainment
an example of some offensive music is the music meaning the music with all types of different profanity
why banned some materials from everyone
would you rather live to or live to
censorship in libraries should not be allowed
just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place
that is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people
not only children some birds also love to eat ripe mangoes
first in the present society everybody has different views and opinions on things that should be discussed
they need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children
in conclusion was very proud and thankful to his parents
it teaches children and adults various now things
second they would check and compare hotels in
their strong points are communication and the ability to gain knowledge quickly
in our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency
dear local newspaper i am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society
or how would we ever get any reports done for work or home work
the mood shown in this quote is that of thankfulness and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express his gratitude towards his parents
i say this because what be offensive to one person not come close to being offensive to another
but there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive
then came along and made me a somebody
we see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying
com or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves
can you imagine a world full of lifeless zombies obsessing over technology such as computers television and cellular phones
he reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope
the mood created by the author in
in example use for projects
i believe that computers benefit society
having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint
the future is not far away
the reasons why i agree with computers have benefits is that
they should be conscious about the essence of democracy
what are the children of the world being taught
he tried to publish it but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive
writing topics should be open to all people because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose
computers only make doing your work easier and faster
these materials do not have to be removed completely
of student study in computers and they learn about thing that they never knew
we must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer
we had lunch in an indian hotel
i do not think that there should be censorship in libraries
without computers everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life
discusses how his family was always growing
when he finally reached the store he was excited and relived
all terms of offense are based on an opinion
did you look up to any of the main characters
should there be censorship in libraries
a student receives a classic home work assignment
the character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time
people losing time to have fun
but the question is will you
on certain websites you can see something that can teach you
also this will help people that are shy around people
the cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living when he comes upon a fish camp
in fact statistics recently released by the show that computers are the leading reason for obesity
for example suppose a few people loved the series but another person who read it later found it offensive and had it censored
so by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again
me and him meet only once a year
the first reason being if you found something offensive it not be to someone else
he is always ready to serve and help his neighbors
third of all if you can chat online with your friends or family
thank you and i hope you agree with my statements
programs like allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends
out computers are used for learning about place and people
she concludes the story saying when the geese come back in the spring she will take the test again
this is yet another reason how computers can benefit us
for a final point i would like to say that computers simply destroy your lifestyle
this is because it explains her love for her family and that is proud to call her family a family
books should not be banned because if they were then we would be ruining the future for others and we would be destroying our own future
also i believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it gives her strength from her old country
that article also states that since child obesity has increased by
this permission slip will and can be used for all movies
again our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing
that is just to long to be on one website
like and the obese have shown how people gain weight
the authors battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills
families speak with each other through
he takes his own time in taking bath and getting ready
if so i am sure your not alone
knowing that they would do the same for them
computers have so much information that the news paper in the future will no longer be known
believes that the less time on the computer means more time on family vacations and with friends
people need more time to interact with their family
studies done by doctor at stated that of people who are on the computer typing have better hand eye coordination than those who do not
they can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to
since there are no real solutions besides banning these items this would be the best plan
each generation of men dies but its thoughts and knowledge that pass from age to age and faithfully kept
i always try to forget and move forward with my life as others should do
if picked up a book on why is the right religion and i am a then more then likely i will find it offensive
there are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to when you can just look up pictures of
also who knows teens are doing on the computer
computers do many things for us
i believe there should be some censorship to some extent
for example i would not want my little brother reading books because some chapters contain a sex scene
the features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways
that person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book
but who knows where technology can take us
the book only be offensive to one race or religion
when you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body
it was a very interesting show
at the end he is looking back at his life as a little kid and how he has improved his life
people can connect with others from all over the world
so what seems to be offensive to people
the only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that
also the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them
censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive
everyone needs to hear it because true
the computers that we have are missing your life us you no it up
these are many great things you can do outside
all through the day he works with his students
censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country
these books are classics and should not be changed or removed from the shelves
on the website you can talk to your friends
the average bill per month is
the can make up there own minds and usually they do what is best
the gives all citizens the freedom of the press
the above conditions show the contrast between western society and peace loving humanity
there are plenty of books out there and many different authors that the person can choose from
when she goes back to take the test shell have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test
it changes from person to person because of varying cultures religions and moral codes
the weather and terrain had worn him down
but know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things
everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive
in school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer
on a light note they could just have an open mind so that the song or the book or the movie can still be sold
also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material
there are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children
then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better
he also is very grateful for his parents sacrifice to give the life he has
in conclusion the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it
kids today need to spend more time outside then playing games on the computer
if it were not for books and novels from the past the current generations would have no clue of what history was about
anything is good in moderation even a computer
dear local newspaper i am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people
the libraries are public for a reason
it is the season of picnics and outings
i think that children are simply not mature enough to be exposed to all of the books magazines and movies
children need to learn those things sometime in their life
movie we watch today talk about doing drugs and how cool they are and how they had fun driving a stolen car
do you find books you read offensive
need computer to help us with research
you can look into going there for vacation or doing a report
so on to the last thing that i am going to talk about
he was a tall frail looking man who commanded respect
people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist
you can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers
that statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart
what happens when someone says the bible is offensive
is a student which is very hard to get
since there are books music movies magazines and etc
my first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them
one has to work hard and practice for some time to become a good meson
i am writing this letter to inform you about the use of computers
i believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this
this fact is quite amazing because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time
they just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of
you can choose whether you want that censorship or not
therefore the mood is happy and warm i would love to be there
secondly he passes a large road sign reading rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
but if problems constantly happen there they will leave and tell their friends this is not a good library
one mood was and friendship
having family all around you
you can not do the thing in the pleasant air of nature
dear newspaper have you ever wanted to see your that lives across the country
he describes them as well as others in their community as honest hardworking selfless people
that really improves your coordination
this should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library
there he was expected to stay for about a fortnight
this affected his mood because he had hope again
in the memo i mentions how thankful truly is to his parents for giving him a life of family and happiness love etc
by living in one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please
there is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves and its not there business what other people see either
kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered
get this need of life invest in a computer
it is this simple freedom that causes books to be published even written no matter how offensive they be
the last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road
this all happened because he listened to the old guys
there are dew drops on the green grass
at the moment she is just homesick even if her home is the now
the mood created by the author was great
another thing is can get anything needed
i know you be thinking that it would be a better experience to go to the but it is really expensive to go to very faraway countries
computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without having to go there
most website like is now in danger
having differently finding specific information
as you can see addition is a no laughing matter
but using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct
so everyone agree with me because you knew i am right
i for one agree computers are helpful because they help you learn about new things talk to people around the world and try new things
their only son was prince rahul
therefore the computer should be supported and not looked down upon
and these books should not be censored in public and school libraries
secondly people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so sports
if we are lucky to have a noble friend he will save us from all our depressions
if the reader does not like the book they are able to close it
computers have caused many people money friends and time
a farmer lives in a village
writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover
also in the author talks about how his parents nothing about the country when they came and how the struggled financially when they came
music is made for the enjoyment of the people
people should go to the gym and build strong muscles
this relieves many people when they know your not there
many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular rather than just browsing
one way computers benefits our society is ability to access ample information pictures and news
with the world today it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio
the setting is one of the most important elements in a story
it will be the best choice you ever make
is a subject too graphic for students
this essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone
also might not be useful
if a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit they should not be allowed to have the book
by reading these children can easily expand their vocabularies
the whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the determination so its fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it
this is my second reason why computers are helpful
before going to sleep i brush my teeth and wish my parents ‘goodnight’
the features of the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways
lastly computer help people all around the world learn about almost anything
i believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate the material should not be taken off shelves
those are a moods in the memoir
and when she begins thriving and feels like herself again then shell be ready to take the driving test and pass
these four boys who are all around eleven years old use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life
these online games are good ways to sire you the opportunity to do something you wont normally do
it is a mixture of many gases
it reminder her of her old home
dear local newspaper i was reading this article about computers
censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools
it is hard to get two people to agree on the same thing
later that night i get home and check my a new notification pops up and i am now friends with my
has that ever happened to you
i believe computers are a good thing for several reasons
once the plant is thriving as such as her tropical home she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test
that shows the fall of man
he had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water
as you can see computers should be used as much as they are being used by the general public
the whole human ace would be in chaos
there should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word or a few violent scenes for them to read
different music books movies and magazines
there could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story
so in theory libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents
and all of them are offensive to someone
you can learn about or you name it you can type it in google and you can learn everything about that country
but recently the availability of the book has been questioned
with music if there is a bad word the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange
if someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library
the next season will be a sort of renewal starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom
then hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty
need new toys for kids
she was really upset
it also allowed to see how full and good his was to
everyone likes to drink orange juice
they want all the guys to stair
some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons
apple store have when people go over and buy some computers
as adults you should know how much obesity matters
when he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence
memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer
we could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers
but those books movies and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem
try something else such as an adult section
new technology such as computers can help us with that skill we should use it
however those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it
you would have to go to the library and search for a book about him
personally i would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book
she can not talk phone because so what do you do you
the author concluded the story like that because she was being positive
in our hamlet things are quite different
it gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see
you have no right to take that away from someone
our media is too intertwined with our lives
your little and your reading about these topics you will then be more informed your just little older
i believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored
we should hate a box the has information in it we should be glad we have something like that in are home
there is a better medical facility and the death rate has therefore fallen
they were like a game that he came successful
it is simply a place to inform and if someone is offended by what they see they should stay away from the library
i believe censorship is wrong
if anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the and leave our libraries alone
how different would our life be me right now
in the wedding hall i sat next to my mother
it shows that like the geese who care and come back she will have time to study and pass her test
she then proceeded to purchase the plant because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again
not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on
there are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against
these things can still benefit our society though
some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies
this shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless
however it is also opening your eyes to new cultures
children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them
the cyclist felt relief later on due to the features
i say we just let it be and let people be happy
i thoroughly believe they are mistaken
in present day most people live on the computer
but too much censorship can become a bad thing
exercising a very important thing for a healthy body and mind have a hard enough time finding time to do this
the authors family in their home people that they considered family this right here is a mood well a caring mood
when the cyclist arrived at the abandoned grape factory he felt on twist of many
there are many forms of music
they just need to learn to deal with it or ignore it like i do
they have censored movies just sitting there
people not exercise at all anymore
the solution is certainly not to remove what some find offensive for many people will disagree until eternity
these are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting
should we put a censorship on the libraries really
many things were new to her
this can cause other kids to have a low self esteem and cause dangerous events in the future
the plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant
another is when the author says she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched against the evening sky slowly fading to the distance
out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people
the author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons
plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software
should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive
then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were
this i could not imagine
dear i have heard the concern of many scientists about computers
no child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults
electricity is very important for us
the mood created by the author was a great mood
so many people rely on technology to get through there life
there is a variety of materials available to the public that be offensive to some especially to their little children
because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives
if i had to bicycle for a long period of time i would much rather have a smooth road so i could renew my energy
my first reason is you can find stuff online
then you go to search and put in then all this of him comes out
to computers can be both and positive but i chose to look at things through a positive eye and i think you should too
said a science teacher at
one reason we use computers is for pleasure
also the mood is grateful
everyone looks fresh and is full of energy
being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature
even though some people disagree computers are the base of technology safe and full of knowledge i do
the ups and downs and all the animals that await him
then just ignore it and go on
in the story rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways
people will spend less time exercising less time outdoors enjoying nature and less time interacting with family and friends
whats the harm in it anyway
some times she explains with the help of charts and maps
his parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life
and because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it
the computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple
it just depends on how society feels about the whole situation
we would get information from the books but not as much as we would get from the computer
one of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information
also with computers you can learn about other nation
most authors are smarter then that or at least i would hope so
but i believe that they should not have to take books music magazines etc
i cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public
when i was a young girl in elementary school i remember doing a whole unit on slavery and the underground railroad
this would be useful to them because since they could not hear what people say they can read what people say through the internet
just a normal family whose lives have been changed due to computers
not only are the helpful but they are fun and easy to use
they have poisonous liquid is entered to the wound of it’s victim
out of people surveyed in agree that the use of computers benefits society
my second reason who f think computers have terrible effect is because eye damage
i also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf
in against it and ill you why
computers can help you do all types of things
is excited that there is a building that might get some water from
no i do not believe they should be but that is my opinion
for example when the cyclist headed from the intense heat he needed to find a town
there will not ever be a book that every human being agrees to be both appropriate and vivacious
although children are able to socialize using the computer they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally
it was rather large but i had come to love reading in that time of my life so i decided i was up for it
finally if your doing a report or something formal you want to look nice right
the second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places
because of this he will probably rest first an old mans short tents again
you need your daily intake of oxygen
my mother is a secretary down town at the low form called
i would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt
i think the libraries should be broken onto sections
computers have led to many dangers
under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination
every person should have that right
first you can learn about places you want to go to
finally my last reason its not only educational its also fun
this is especially good for me because not too long ago one of my best friends moved away to
their are like people that are offensive and things that go on in our and your area were you live that are really offensive
we thanked god that we had landed safely
computers is what we use to live we need them to survive
a major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors
we miss out on all the other important things in life just because of to much time on our laptops
another reason why they have these connections its probably because its a better way to see one another if you live in different parts of earth
the heart of their home is the kitchen because they all love to cook
where these people learned to love
dear local newspaper i am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers
last but at the risk of sounding cliched definitely not the least computers are very powerful research tools
if you want to learn something new or meet new people then i suggest you stop eating those chips get off that couch and use the computer
the more you use a computer the more you know about it
i know our school library here at has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees
the internet has a massive effect on us
computers also benefit our society because they are like big cellphones with a huge keyboard
we know so much more about other places now than we did before computers
lets say i was a fan of and i read that she stole something
but you have very handwriting and you cant do it on paper you will have to use word or a writing program on computer
many girls have gotten taken because of this
in conclusion the cyclist in the end found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in
the quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored
should be removed from the library
lastly they help people become less stressed by playing computers games
sitting at home on the couch eating a bag of potato chips
are for entertainment
that idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out
also they will feel really upset and sometimes can get mad for that
this exert explain the hot arid climate of where he was cycling
most libraries are open to the public
is for children under the age
being addicted to the computer is too
the last paragraph of winter hibiscus describes determination and the growth of a person
your outside about a few hours
that leads me to my last point that no information can be bad information
no one is being forced to read a book or magazine watch a movie or listen to music
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story
many people like different books music movies and magazines
i once talked with someone on for over an hour
keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment
they are there to provide all kinds of different information
these works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor
equally important using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs
they are one of the most growing technologies in our world
people spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people
censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be
then he came upon rolling hills and rough
in olden days paddy cultivation was done only in one season
a ghost town with no good water could have killed him
yoga is something to help take away stress inside of you
i support the advance in technology especially in computers
one reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated
people and politicians try to cash on the sufferings of people
after helping her find the she ask is this book so important to people
if everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them then no works would remain
and even in construction business
computers are a big part of my life and i still have time to do other things with my family and friends
there are books up and down the shelves in the library that make people wonder they are up there
what be offensive to one person not be to another
people find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone
in school they will hear verbal arguments and see fights
but movies show you how bad things are shown
people use computers everyday
the chief guest arrived on time
reading that book should let you see how that child grew up
i believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in the world today
materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole
the mood created by the author is loving because it talks about how generous and caring his family is
my dear mother had come home
this made the cyclist tired and weary
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love
statics show that people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with there own children or parents

they both overcome obstacles
sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk
it would be a lot easier than driving over to the persons house then driving driving all the way back

now can not type out and still do all his other homework
there is music and magazines too
raped in websites such as and many other dangerous websites
lastly you can use computer to find out about world news
i am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens
having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person
laid his books up on the counter and we checked out
and it not only helps with baseball but with other sports such as juggling golf or tennis
this works for a lot of situations not just this one so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them
we just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way
however i disagree with that
in the end home is about relationships rather than physical space
the might be so more this lands
some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor
the computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history
speech on the educational value of travelling
she felt that life was full of hope again
there are many reasons to support this but here are three
on the other hand young children are in need of censorship
all sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore
my last reason would be that nowadays everyone nos computers
obviously the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people
this is on issue that needs attention
well in the library they will have generations of books on offensive material
typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs
each of these are used to plan sell present manage and write about products
computers are good for last minute situations

lastly health issues are raising rapidly
most people use some kind of computer to talk chat and text
computers as you can see have both good and bad effects
since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water the dry long hills seem to make him more weak and tired
dear local news paper computers is a good idea because every developed country uses computers

think about it would it be cool to visit a great place like
i do have to agree with because she is right
in this case it was leaving friends family and work behind and moving to a totally different country
one last reason computers are beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs
it gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there
someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others
in that point of view you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves
i remember in grade when a girl named got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color
the question is what effects do computers have on people
for moment i did got caught up on
it can be fun chatting educational or hard working
the reasons are to teach hand eye coordination learn about faraway places and talk to people online
if people want to have heir things shown such as movies or heard such as music it should be appropriate
in the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season
dear do people benefit from the use of computers
hearing her daughter tell her how much it is
these are the reasons how the computer effects education your heath and your time
the whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like i honestly was the experiencing his home the love kindness of his home
as he saw no buildings in sight for many miles he began to lose his determination as well as hope
if you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question
or that ball you meanie
i use to keep in touch with family on the
for the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre
a second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket
besides no ones making you check out that book
the mood created by the author was mostly happiness and thankfulness
he also takes letters from the school to other nearby offices
kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers
also they allow you to talk to friends and family over the internet
others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us

a young manknight without armouroffered me his seat near the exit
books are very important to people and need some entertainment other than television
these facts have not just contributed but they are almost the cause of obesity in the world
they do not have limbs
at least when you research using a book or encyclopedia you can trust those sources
eventually though kids are going to be faced with those things
some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water
children have their own selection of books and movies
you can get a lot of good information on the internet but you can also get a lot of bad information
even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader
magazines can put false information out so people will believe it
it is a place to get away from it all i think they should leave them just how they are
do you believe that certain materials books music movies and magazines should be removes from the shelf if it is offensive to some people
i feel very happy to see the fruits plants and flowers in my garden
the setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way
if they can publish them then we should be able to read them no matter what our age is
there are many bad things about the invention of computers they give access to the internet
they need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that war want happen again
i think we have the right to know about important events
lastly not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves
sometimes you simply be curious about something your computer will be right their for you to use
to better prove my point think of your favorite book
lack was not a factor in this story
of the people who work at public businesses do this going along with ads when could also or another reason for this
computers prepare is with skills we are going to need when we get jobs
thus being said i believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum
also she likes the geese and the hibiscus and these things might make her feel more comfortable
everyone uses them or has used them before
but also kids and adults should be having some fun time outside and enjoying it
later on he was sent to a bed in the ward
dear i think that computers have a negative affect on us
the child must be at least in order to get a pass from the parent though
dear computers are an amazing advantage to use in this modern day and age
one theme of the story is to never give up
not only will you have better communication and the news at the top of your fingers but you will also have advanced education
on the other hand a poor man with good health can enjoy his life
you be able to look up ways to stop global warming but does it mean you are going to really do it
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was
the native country of the ostrich is africa

those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books
computers can help you so much if you need an answer
computers are a huge advancement in business
these things are a great solution to the rising lost of entertainment
are you worried you do not get enough exercise

i think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science
i wanted to sit in one of those big planes
computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources
i think as long as its blocked off into a different room everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm
the statements given by the ministers legislators and other politicians are published in the newspapers
to whom it concern the idea of censoring books music movies or anything else from libraries or from the public eye is very offensive
in my perspective i just feel that the authors of these books are just writing and lets the creativeness take over
but what about the other thing
just make sure that you know what your kid reads
is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age
so as the plant blooms so does her comfort level
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy enjoyable and worth living
for some it be pictures
she opened her laptop and found where her kid was
he does not misuse the facilities provided to him
at last my brother came home and i was happy
dear local newspaper opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people
the society in proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways
when people start going on the computers they stop doing a lot of things
computers are only the start of it all
i just think that is not a movie to let kids watch
the sound of falling rain was pleasing to the ears
you can also talk to your friends and even video chat with them too
the mood is loving in many different ways
if i wanted to i could find offense in everything that is in a library
in the memoir there is more the one mood but this is the main one
books even be inappropriate for little kids
she is trying to get over the fact that she is not at home that things and people that use to be ground no longer are
the association of reported that in of used a website and of them were in good positions
for example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face
then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch
he thought he was going to die he said i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean
she is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic
dear newspaper the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend
the mood created by the author in the memoir is love
the censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree
imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty
and depicts the intense heats of the desert
in a way this makes sense
i wondered if something was wrong with me if i has a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion
and we can be able to post games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans
the computer is a great way to learn about things but it also a great way to become a junkie and fat
it tones up the whole system
for the movies are not really that bad your child will end up seeing it one way or another
a convenient way to do this was by using a computer
in libraries there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location
they all sing about gangs narcotics alcohol and using women for favors
like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face
for adults it could be information on starting a business
that even though you left your family friends jobs everything is okay because you are with each other
things would be so much better
most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate but computers are updated so frequently you have all the facts all the time
he then tells his science class who the spread the word of preservation of the forest
i understand how exercise is essential to your body however talking with friends is important too
so my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no
no i do not think that some of these materials should be removed
besides education computers touch upon our economy as well
but whose to say what i think should have an affect
i believe that this should still happen
then different learning programs to teach us a different language
such features of his surroundings played a large part in the authors change in mood
we need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal
people be able to censor books but no one can censor life
along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats
she speaks of the driving test geese and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story
people should have their own choice
would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it
you also learn social on the computer
blocked the pavement in front of me
computers allow all of these essentials to be part of society and the way this generation has decided to start our lives
thousands upon thousands of people were killed for their religious belief as well as homosexual people and other minorities
so this heat will eventually heat up the earth
on the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more
how much easier could it get
in a library only certain things should be done
you always have the choice to go outside and take a walk
also instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back we can use online textbooks
also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance
many things are offensive but then again much of life offensive
i tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color
once we reached there our teacher helped us to select a comfortable place to sit
computers are so much easier to use than books
the mood that was created by the author is loving
there was no sign of civilization what so ever
there was a great rush
what would we do without them
some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say
he is a middle aged man
censorship is found on television in libraries in schools and even in homes
i like to shop online for discounts and sales where i know thing are cheaper than in stores
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills is a main problem the cyclist faced
in the censorship has almost never been present
the huge world of the can change our lives
she says its strong enough to make it through the cold month here this winter hibiscus
books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading
hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways
having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses
letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous
i believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing the internet
finally at the end of the the author creates a sincere
say growing up your favorite books were the
its amazing what technology does
the libraries are doing just fine the way they are and have been for years and will for years to come
even teachers were reading it
as a result many are suffering from various physical and mental disorders
it is just like the book where is watching and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read and even think
nowadays there are social networking sites like and that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away
people just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials
i totally agree with this
many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer
this program is used from everything to research papers to
there are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area and others are in another area
everyone can go for that goal
a thing that helps these parents are restrictions on the stuff that you are able to get your hands on
without the internet
if a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer
and they will go out and do anyways
designed with distinctly different minds people want to read distinctly different books written by distinctly different authors
now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad
third he describes his friends and family who visited often
number two you can use a computer for research and number three it can tell you directions or give you info
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills so he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster
or what if your computer brakes
to computers have made life easier for almost every person who has one
people are people and everyone should be treated the same
yes at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school
mr david and the members of his family are very cooperative and helpful
the mood in this memoir is gratefulness
they can even make you sick or angry but they do not harm anyone
they cost a lot of money
the towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted
the setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way
the internet has over millions of websites for many reasons
he has thanked them many times
if they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then i know plenty more novels that would be gone as well
also shows the man was very thirsty
one reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers
the setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist
another health risk is having bad eyes
we have to nurse it well
in a library everybody should have the right to read every book
he was wearing a worn out chappal and had a red scarf round his neck
also people need to be able to talk online
people should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it
your with your family your supposed to spend time with them
he thought how to get rid of these sufferings
people like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know
most people like the songs because it says to do bad things they just want to be heard or want attention
there are certain sights like and where we can interact with other people
parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such seeing something that a toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see
so with the sun comes more heat
back before the telephones was invented people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating
it is a hard choice to make
for example is a sight designed to match people up for romantic relations
is it really worth sitting in front of the computer all day eating
writers and editors of the newspaper please agree with me on this topic
and the is suffering because of it
secondly students like to listen to music
also it is easy for companies to attract business
he grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off
it can be played indoors as well as outdoors
some people like certain books or media and dislike others
after all everyone wishes to be treated kindly right
dear people are spending far to much time on computers
born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book magazine or a movie
i might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world
everyone likes something different so their should be different books
that is how the setting affect the cyclist
so who would have negative effects of the computer
anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer
certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there
they continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events
the subject of so many debates over the years from lawyers against judges to parents against children
we need stricter libraries
people want to just change everything and make sure things are perfect and nothing bad is in the world
open your laptop for easy translation
and if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it
this is a hard question to ask
some students play different games in the playground
there is a big blackboard too
they go out and say raciest things
this would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was
the reason love and kindness is the mood because he says he loves his parents for self sacrifice so that he could grow up in the of
you can email instead of using letters
this means they will be on them all the time and never do other things like go outside
you should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else
he speaks to every one and is generous and kind
different subjects offend different people
i hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made and friends have been reunited
be a bigger person and allow that person to live there dream through a story
her mother replies with a you what
mr david has four childrentwo sons and two daughters
but that is not the only bad thing about them
therefore he drank more water
ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do
it prevents freedom of expression
the cyclist in rough road ahead do not exceed the posted speed limit was greatly affected by the setting
the freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world
in this memoir the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories
any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button
many people adults and have because they are world but there that should be explored and people should be thankful for beautiful that we have still
but when i get on a computer it gets to be much better
if the things that are in the book are true or are in real life
it affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has
when i was little i went to the mall with my grandmother
if it were a magazine they might look at it
this shows that he has a genuine appreciation for what they did
or they could play educational games
having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone
this shows that the home is peaceful
there are many ways to approach this question
you can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years
finally my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be
because they have affect on people who use computers and other electronics
for example helps you with essays and reports
you get most of your vitamins
i have little brothers and they are
to prove there over twenty
you can get pictures some important cities and places and some knowledge on the people who lies there
this person enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy
or the libraries having books like that
but you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you
when you have to write a research paper
we are all different and interpret things in different ways
walking in and we see books music and magazines lining the walls most containing explicit material
no one is forcing you to read the material
computers are very helpful now mostly every thing gets done on it
it is better to go outside you got fresh air its nice and cold
not only did see the positive effects of staying in contact
we have the freedom of speech in the
have fun and learn lots
many people think that using computers is a bad thing but look at the facts
now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability contracting others and last but not least made me and yours life better
sure many people spend way to much time on their computer but other people use it to save information or find research
our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete utter disaster
i believe that the books music movies magazines should be removed if they are really offensive
music and movies are a different story
which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novelmagazinesmusicor movies
because they teach hand eye coordination give us the ability to learn about far away people and places and allow us to chat online with people
so yes take the offensive books off and there will be no problems
for example the narrator describes water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips
i will not waste money in buying cakes and arranging big parties to celebrate my birthday
the question is does computers have a positive effect on society
this faster finish can lead to kids not staying up too late
that all changed when my mother discovered
so i believe that people should get of the computer and exercise
we can also use it to learn about news happening around the world
religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship but is that not in our constitution
lastly they should enjoy life
the author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community
the blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles
libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing
after getting his hopes up he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on
censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination
libraries in i am going to write a persuasive essay about what i think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book
he took it out on the water in at our home and the engine and motor were broken
you the work on the computer
this could lead to not only the religious books being banned but anything that strays from the social norms
where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect
these are some examples of how the describes the mood
it has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today
also it could help you get a job
majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true
there is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your
not only books but magazines and movies help as well
when i go to the library i think i would mind is i saw some thing
the hills make it very hard to pedal when going up hill
also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all
computers are addicting
while using a computer you can also talk to people
the purpose of libraries is to educate the citizens of this country and try to better them and help them make clear informed decisions based on their prior knowledge
a people we are quickly learning that what was once so genius is actually dangerous
people of different culture background and life could be profound by these articles in readings
example is if you forgot to write down your homework in your agenda or something then you can go on the school website and see what your homework is
spending time in nature is that particular persons
it was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner
the serves many functions
this reminds me of my cousin
there are happy grateful stressed calm relaxed and harsh moods
your town have a gym community center or a library
i think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge
also the computers become the center of their lives
life would have been much more difficult
finally you spend less and less time with you family
finally you can waste your time at home and not explore the
the greatest impart is the computer
both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike
year i wanted to play catch with my dad but was on his old computer doing what he does
the items that do contain graphic content cursing etc
through reading i have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population
knowledge is gained by asking searching and learning
the entire library is split up into different sections
the is one of the greatest countries ever to exist yet we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives
i use the computer for mostly everything i do
both great resources for talking with others
the computer is a very valuable too
not one minded the inconvenience of wet umbrellas soaking shoes and wet clothes
materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content
what would it be like
another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material which is very understandable
children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate
this is censorship at a basic level and it happens to millions of books movies and songs every day
i am mature enough to know not to act out on what i read and i am already aware of most of the things that books present
then they finally got along and won the champion game
how can one person say if something is wrong
as a result the students grades would increase
denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson
the kids could see something they think is really neat on the and then go out and try that
readings is something that we cannot get away from
and that is all done with computers
people need to realize these bad effects and majorly decrease their computer usage
computers can help people with their homework and essays
the books that interest me the most are fiction books
this shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime
dear local newspaper you have a computer at home you enjoy
computers a benefit to have
the effect of the story strikes our thoughts so forcefully but nowhere the characters overplay their emotions
the sun had just set
one day as i was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on and its people
censorship is not only wrong its unnecessary
i for one think that this is a terribly made thought
computers have helped this country grow and prosper
you should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online
a certain amount of time can be plugged in
parents hard earned money is being wasted away on these extremely expensive computers they can pay anywhere from
all of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though
parents who prefer their own children not to see or listen to certain materials have the right to censor the materials away from their children
now have you ever thought were this heat goes
this happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers
the way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible
it is so much faster than looking through thousands of books
it should not be on the shelf of any book store i think if the grow up does read it no child should have the right to
or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers
because its hot and hes tired he begins to see mirages that affect him
i am clearly in favor of owning and using computers
fiction books are the first books children know how to read this is where they start their reading skills
my advice computers are terrible
as a result computers are the blame
i strongly suggest you look over my terms
expresses his gratitude toward them a lot
first computers are a learning resource and a way people stay updated with the world around them
another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences
by saying this i do not think music should be taken out of libraries either
this is why it is set too a sadly love mood
this is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for their parents do for them
the author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope
for someone to make negative lyrics about a person or something says something about the person who made that song
yes it might take away times to do other things like exercising but we can find out away to do both
our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons
we can meet new people on the internet
because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior
i believe that computers can ruin your life and make you go blind
in the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help
also online you new people or make as many new friends
there goes all the time you could have been doing something good wasted because of the computer
at some works the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having and about meetings
dear i am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies
everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of
they get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities
try not to get involved with any online games being in a nationwide disease
of students get out of school and go straight to the computer
in the novel to a the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive
many people are affected negatively by computers
just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library
john is a fruit vendor
also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home
with all the money libraries and schools save they can put it towards something learn fulfilling
the narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope challenge physical pain despair and relief
so the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out
you can in less than one minute go on the internet type in to whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly
when the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again
many individuals are spending too much on their computer and less time working out or exercising
so instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do
back in my military days nothing helped better than talking
my imaginary friend is a user in my imagination
yes computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances but at what cost do these technological advances come
the computer has a positive affect on society because on it you can learn of faraway places their history and you can learn of their landscape
this was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he had been hitting his water bottles pretty regularly
i will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version
this is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood
the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change
it will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them
the mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love
these are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir
thus an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work
my mother always has her heart and arms open to anyone who needs to be loved
another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person
books can be a way of learning how to deal with thing in a better way
children now look up to these song writers and want to become them
talking to people from around the world can be interesting
i had a pleasant dream last night
she is reminded of her home by these flowers and she has with this she can retake it and do it rite
this shows how one gets drained by hills
let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world
i think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves
without technology things would be so much harder
also now you can buy food on internet and lots more
in conclusion computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away
dear computers do not have a positive effect on people
this could be dangerous at times because not all materials give a specific summary of what happens
she bought herself a flower to cheer herself up
imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song
the three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough
you could live in and email someone in
if they find something offensive about the material then they can just not look at
another statistic should that you know and use computers you would live longer and happier
day my dad was pulled over three times for
however the effects it has on people can be bad
everybody sat down for lunch
but we can prevent this if we the of time people out spend on computers
during projects a kid want know everything so a good way to get information is to goes on the computer and search what your looking
he was taken to a private hospital and was admitted as an emergency case
what if you live far away from the nearest library
but not at all of us can afford to travel far away
when a child sits at the computer all day they are not getting exercise
people are and less about the environment does to computer
but with computers and online sights like or you can talk to virtually anyone in the world
also you can even play video games on your computer
when censorship of television comes into question i believe that this is the reason we have ratings
the features of the setting affected the cyclist
last it can help us do are homework if we have on it
libraries are serious places and should be treated as such
i think that if it is something that offends you then you should just keep going
so make sure they all stay clear and far away from them
she was upset about leaving her home and she was upset about failing her test but thanks to a flower she got her confidence back
the towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or ghost town
as you can see the computer can help society
when i was little my parents use to tell to go to the library and learn something
dear i have same questions for you and i was hoping you could answer them
that is all i have to say for now
however computers have more negative effects on people
people are spending more time on computers and less than exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful
my now lucky i to be able to realize how and the research is because of computers
ended up staying with and getting married
in this memoir the author touches upon serious facts while giving the memoir a fun and happy mood
in the spring shows when the flower will come back
you can feel the warmth of the room with the adjectives he uses
books are created to read and have interest laughter enjoying
also the terrain affects the biker
the author chooses to end the story in a very deep connected way
computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch
the author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background
with one click a message can be rent to anywhere in the world
but we you create this you child has to give a parents email address were they have to read the following terms to chose for their child
i would enjoy my hobbies and complete some urgent duties also
like music books have many categories
they cleared away the crowd
there are many games and other types of games out on the internet
so plants and trees help to generate fresh air
well you could go on the computer
my second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades
this is true not as long as you stay reasonable with usage or your computer it benefits you in many ways
memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test
going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay
some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people
on the computer what exercise benefits are you getting
you know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer
which is funny how those books are the only books that were fun to read during the school year
this shows that even though she failed it this time when the hibiscus gets bigger she will retake the test it shows
through reading the book by i have observed that parents need to have some involvement in their children are reading listening to and watching
so when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot
the states how he will always be grateful for what his parents did for him
books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race
they have forget a kind of family feeling among the neighbors
what about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things
the computer helps by reading it aloud to mom
some might find it offensive and others not
every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects
pickpockets have their day at such hours
this advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue is that really bad
just get off that computer
dear newspaper i believe that computers have a positive affect on society
either way she should be careful
he then goes to the fields
i recently visited and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them
taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it
you can still believe what you want and read this book
so now think would you want to be lonely overweight and deprived of nature
because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist the cyclist learns a lesson
the cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water
too which leads to lack or exercise
they also play with complete stranger
last reason is i know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier
also you can talk with your friends if your phones not working
the most important thing in life is family and friends technology should get in the way of that
offensive material to people is like a good book you can read and learn more about
if they would only have one type of book not many people would want go the the
every kid likes to play on the computer
with all the ways computers help us there is no reason why they would negatively affect us
finally he reaches a bait shop with cool water and he is relieved
they allow people to communicate with friends and family
little children go to the library looking for books and etc
his report card is unbelievable
it makes viewing more interesting and exciting
but very few people are punctual
there was a big garden
my six hundred dollar computer crashed
the first reason why believe computers are good is because many kids in school will need them
if libraries start censoring books we end up with less and less readers as the years go on
that number has risen to out of as of
the road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip
you can go to a baseball game park or movies anything that will get you away from that computer
with this personal info could and with these websites the crime rate has gone up
the green leaves of absorb carbon dioxide and break it up into carbon and oxygen
this means he will dehydrate quicker and will need more water
on the other hand somebody else could be perfectly fine with it
but are computers a good thing
they work their tails off to produce new things for us
i think that reading books is a very positive thing
as the author observes in paragraph wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt i could drop from heatstroke
even i was done reading this it i thanked the lord for computer it helps us so much
fiction or nonfiction
here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance
as well as using the the online book instead taking it home
had a earthquake we went on websites for that
i probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life
there are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed
no matter if you have to start all over and doing it again
that is until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet
it has some what gossip
the features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist the setting was hot and rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty
its good to go on the computer for a little a bit but your on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat
how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads rolling hill and the
first you meet how people or friends
that right for what they are think
today we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library
having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch
but i hope to find some good home again
turns out the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities
it is not right to deprive communication through these things
use a computers and your life will be changed for the better
and everyone knows that if you get good grades in school almost any job you could be qualified in
there are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by
how do i know all of this you ask
never find fault or speak ill of them
i believe that it is unjust because the girl not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project
parents and teachers should insist upon children to read more books
maybe you do not understand if you have been assigned in a certain class
what do you do when you have no book for a specific subject
they appear in films and books and now have invaded all walks of life
or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away
it also a symbol of her constant blossoming
a library for example is one place you find some of these conflicts
the first reason i thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there
that is why i think that computers help develop a smarter brain
people are now these days
they did not go to study then and confined themselves to house duties
music can talk about stuff that that person done and make that child want to do it because they might think its cool cause the artist does it
he begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water
i will elaborate in the following three paragraphs
helps life if you work in a office or a trademark
do a adults and kids spend to much time on the computer
for example the was further route he takes is not only but also has no place to get water
it is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research
one book to one person could mean something totally different to another
pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex race and violence
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways
therefore the nature of where his bike passed and the things he saw affected his choices and ability
the song was by a band named
artists are ones to take risks and so are writers
my next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests
this can be stopped if parents put their foot down set limits and make kids spend more time outside
another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading
where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around
this shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking
i am a large fan of books over the two that took place
but what about theaters you ask
also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer
when you take away materials that some people use to learn you take away their ability to learn
because is not her homeland there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to and the story shows her struggle to adapt
it is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence
movies at a library are put their for educational reason like to teach kids to count and to learn something about a certain topic
hello my name is and i am going to enforce you that computers can benefit our society
the author is happy that they did
magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes
for example in everyone eats seafood
local library closes at pm
soon you will become fat
it is how they express themselves
from my point of view yes because libraries are public which means they are open to any and everyone
the cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to
the mood in this memoir was soft with an exception
if you want to chat with your friend go to a place out
people make different movies because everyone is not alike
secondly he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water which was making him became dehydrated
online interaction is not like just talking to someone in person or on the phone
healthy persons can think properly act promptly and work peristently
we should all join hands to build a greener and healthier environment
if it is a child or a young teen then i believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch
the computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people
i rushed over to her and put her back to sleep
most to all times the takes from the genre
he just had to keep going
yes i said it they should stay wright where they are
do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with
the parents were happy about what they did and who they loved
his attitude changed greatly throughout the story
my last opinion is that computers are used for working online
people have the freedom of speech
i used to watch this girl named
but we do still see them on our shelves
everyone has different tastes not only in food but in every other part of their lives as well
here are three reasons why
books movies music magazines or even computer excess
it teaches you bad thing it changes your life
there will always be unhappy people in the world
let us make reading a regular habit and so become a creative member of the world community
if a healthy person is found begging he should be punished by the law
i do that all the time and i like it
its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated
my ambition is to become a doctor
that is why i have written this letter to you
music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored
should we remove books and media because they are offensive
what is you method of learning
there are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing or a bad thing
parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries
there are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes
a for says that sites like have skyrocketed in popularity over the
compared to an alcohol addiction about or drug addiction addiction is microscopic and not to mention not deadly
is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read
i would let him read it to learn about the past
i believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people
i feel this way being that lack of email skills no exercising and its addicting
that is why she concludes the story that way
this ties up the mood throughout the memoir
we also are doing our part to destroy the environment
our daily lives would be dull and boring without new technology
how cool is that reading this letter and sharing it to your company i believe that you should support my cause
the overall mood created by the author of this memoir is one of complete gratefulness
first of all without computers there would be no internet and without that many jobs would fail
the children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are
the internet in this instance obviously had a positive impact on society
if we do take off the offensive stuff off the self then there are not any more on the self
libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves
computers are a great reference point can allow you to chat with
so if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about or know where came from
so if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with
it can change the way that children think or what they think would be cool to physically do
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
first of all removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they offend certain people is completely unwarranted
most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other
what makes kids behave better being sheltered from life or being life smart and knowing what is going on in this world
i also managed to get all the information just from my computer
primary ones include the ability to exchange messages with friends and family help in the medical field and expansion of knowledge
some people use the computer to make music
the only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands
is this really what you want
there are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers
in my opinion the citizens of would want to keep it more clean and be more about their
for example they go on website they go on it over over over again
they thought it was bad for kids to listen to
is happy his parents moved to and is grateful of the sacrifices they had to make do do it
the cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through
he thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy
on the contrary they are all over the country and are used by people of all ages
so the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail
some people not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence but others will find it very offensive
well this is one of the many effects the members of a family get together which could weaken them as a family
the rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water
it just be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion
when she says that her babysitter was her first friend
your old enough to be able to handle the content
my last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight
if you agree with me i thank you
it gives her greater confidence within herself
there are certain ways to research information effectively
sports are also a good way to get outside
the overall mood of this excerpt from the book home the blueprints of our lives by is of love and gratitude
they let people talk online
this is one reason why our public library should not have rated movies
there are some beautiful paintings on the walls
if a student does some mistake he is not very harsh to him
first of all the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult
many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit
stories like that often break rest on the internet
a few months ago i was at the local library searching for the perfect book
but sometimes people take advantage over it
if we were not introduced to it so early we would not be going behind our parents backs trying to do it
many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it
next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get
computers have a positive effect on people because it helps learn about places talk to their family and keep track of their job
censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for
many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them
and even better you can buy a tax program for you computer so you never have to leave your couch
libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests
studies show that of people with computers have either or installed in their computers
well its the same thing when people want to censor the libraries
disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library
school was indeed our computer we world
you could always try that
some people feel they have a positive effect such as learning new information and interacting or chatting with other people
the kids need to step up for a change
my use it when people are hurt and i know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy
animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist
the computer can teach us many new and exciting things
for example people past and blog lies about people online
people have there own choice on what they want to read watchor listen to
the plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now
nowadays that is their way to communicate with their peer
not only can computers help you with information it can make school projects so much easier
some students sit in their classrooms
there are many books over these topics that many people find offensive or just completely oblivious
more and more people are being sucked into electronics and less people are caring about our planet
here this winter hibiscus
those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision
first of all i think that computers benefit our society because lets people in contract with family and friends in other states
these books are extremely good
these children eat because they have nothing better to do
once he finds them they are either ghost towns or are not useful at all
because maybe that person who wrote the book or movie was expressing how they feel and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves
some of my friends to have started enjoying a reading book as much as i do
some people say that computers enable internet conversations between friends and computers pass off information about faraway places and people
i cannot remember a time when i went to the library and seen something that was offensive
there are many reasons movies can be offensive
all of them are white
you just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home
for example my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer
i remember my brother was working on his project
this energy loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable
the mood is also appreciative
an ironic twist as he calls it
they even have webcams so you can see each other
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
also his friends could come over too
no one would have any food to eat at a restaurant at school or any where else not even at home
pornography vulgar language grotesque scenes and many other things make books and movies inappropriate for some
this is a terrifying effect on people because now these computers are brain washing us
she symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past
a boy can play football on line then take what he learned and use that in a real football game
things will be much simpler in the long run
and i know that know one whats that to happen
we have the ability to choose what we want and do not want
when it was two hundred degrees left and no water left he pushed himself to the light
these hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water
you can learn quite a bit with a computer
and they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it
some material be appropriate for children but they also are all inappropriate
from school to work to just fun
when you are clumsy you break things
i believe they are already censored enough
this is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route you can even print a map and go hiking
belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words
other people think that rap music is amazing
books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need
suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read
along with moviesand etc
i listen to the radio station sometimes and all the music is mostly about violence
if people know what type of material it is and still choose to view it then they get what they ask for
as you can see having a computer can be fun but its not the only thing to do on a computer
i feel that however possible you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires
any popular material should be available at the library
there are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race religiongenderetc
instead of sitting on a computer all day they can do something a lot more productive such as taking a walk starting a club adult once children
once they put something out there they cannot take it away
another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction
if you do not have anything what i just said there is also texting
i hope one day we can all turn off out computers for good
hockey is played with eleven players on each side
this is because i do not think children know as much as we do so it will give them wrong ideas they have taken the wrong way
think about the point that the person who wrote or made the movie were trying to get across
the author also says how he admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly
computers take away from friends and family time
plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway
although some speech is looked down upon it should not be censored
i use the computers to better understand it
books are very important to our society
this quote shows his love and pride for his culture
there are many educational websites on computers
i for example have learned so much from
finally the computer is a great way to communicate online
obviously there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature
computers are damaging peoples health should be something done about it
nature has its own scheme of colours for sustenance and renewal of its rhythm and cycle
to acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be years of age
this is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months in which the weather is rough
this question might be answered forever
as she sees the geese flying overhead she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year
some people like to play games
therefore i believe ho end winter hibiscus to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles
this is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials
we saw the industrial progress of these countries
people who spend to much time on the computer would barely understand whats going on
also every thing they get from the computer you get from book
i believe that there should not be censorship in libraries
hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know
libraries should not take certain books movies and magazines away that some people find offensive
a friend like that is helpful
others feel that sensitive audiences not be comfortable with the text
these have been many advancements on computer technology and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it
a computer can also hold pictures that you take on a digital camera
early morning they go to school and come back tired in the evening
little by little we can help people what they can do with out using an computer
never find fault or speak ill of them
first of all he describes the selflessness of his parents
but when you do it just to spite someone then that is very hurtful
earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem
it is a persons own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so
computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives
what look vulgar to someone might not look so offensive to another individual
so by behaving well we can win the hearts of everyone
they have a very positive effect on you
as the famous saying your friends jumped off a bridge would you flashes through your mind let me answer that for you
you never get up unless you absolutely need to
also the theme was festive because describes the large parties and dinners that were constant at his home
would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you
and all the trouble it puts people through
censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media
lastly it can help us gather information for homework and projects
you have a web cam you can see family members from different states and see the face and talk to them like you are talking in person
here is my opinion on if i think that those books should be removed or not
do you believe computers have a negative effect on people
i wanted to let you know that there have been some great and interesting books that i have read from the schools library and the public library as well
dear people like computers a known fact
but for them there is no learning just accepting
the removal of these things become harmful to a new generation in the long run
but instead of just going and sitting on the couch for the whole night you could go to the computer and do a fun game for a little while
the can hurt people cause addiction and seclude your life
my friend barely used a computer and always played outside
also when he says the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement
they can start believing that they are nothing
many families across the globe use computers whether their from all the way to the deserts of
also less kids are reading
it told me the address the phone number and the name of the manager
if a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home
many a time she helps us in locating and selecting books
once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages
so take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch
google is the number one searching website we have
imagine you working on a project in school
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
in the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong
but i am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read
some information should be only seen by adults
those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once is sold in stores
there also useful for work most people use computers for work
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready
another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families
for all the reasons i have stated i do not agree with removing anything off the shelves because something finds it to unacceptable if not offensive
most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health
this quote explains what the plant meant to her
loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him
since are living in modern ages families understand that kid leaves to college they might be going far away or even across the country
people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all
all in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific books
this makes people happy and still keeps them informed about what their family members or friends are up to
first of all computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have
also if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them
i believe that computers have a great effect effect on people
i am working hard so that i many get the best grades
i have never in my years of seen a book or heard of someone who saw a book that offended them
is vital and computers are taking this away from society
libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended
did you know that you can literally but from on your computer
would exercise everyday after work for two hours
computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther
that book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book
first i think that computers can sometimes make you smarter
is just of several quotes from a book that i am reading that some people could take offense to
after thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents
this is how computers come in handy in every day life
i think growing up learned to very important lessons
several reasons first in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life
we need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves
though the sun was bearing down he refused to give up just as he says the sun was beginning to beat down but i hardy noticed
these are all things that should not be allowed to access on a computer
therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries
not all censorship has to do with sex
and if we got rid of all the more mature books what kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read
it can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams
furthermore when a kid comes across a very offensive book it could hurt there feelings
the world would be better off without computers
when you are on the phone it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back
that puts him in more despair because he could get hurt by a wild animal or run out of water with no place to go get more
computers are bad because they can become a computer
lastly the computers much more efficient is looking yet things
is it that important
dear newspaper you see owning a computer can effect you
some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to
who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie
she knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant that she will pass the test
the mood the author created was a peaceful mood
what would you say to them
people are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer
events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past
censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society
also no one is in sight
the computer is bad for you so you should stop and think about what i wrote in this persuasive letter
instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials
as a result many people are not as healthy as they should be
let us now look now at what a book movie magazine or song offends with to be censored
some phone services are very expensive and cost even more money for long distance calling
also some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer
you could also make lots of new friends by going out doors
in my opinion computers are helping not hurting
this part of terrain shows its effect
dear newspaper i have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society
at the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him
many of my own friends are update status or pictures on for three hours every night
some other notable games are of and
population has a computer and check email or go on the computer every ten minutes
without some limit on censorship in a library absolutely anything could be found there
censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good
dear local newspaper i agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff
the spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers like spring
just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either
but who has time to go to the library and spend hours searching for an answer that would take a matter of seconds to find on the computer
dell and so many other computer companies sell computers at ridiculously expensive prices
in addition parents have the responsibility to watch over their children
there is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer
if you have never played this before when you sign in it does some tests and determines the age of your body
music is like a drug to me and i am addicted
says that using a computer helped you type
this shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories
what is your opinion
for all of these reasons i proudly say that i believe that these different books movies lyrics and magazines should be kept on the shelves
many people have to read almost every day people not realize it but they do
they might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer
no it helps them learn socialize with family and friends and they can get in shape with the new exercise that they learn from how to videos
computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society
exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit
and people to watch you and can tell you you are too young for that stuff
at eight o’clock we have dinner
let me explain more these reasons
in the progress the computer has put over of single people and expressing the relationship
on his search my younger brother had found himself a sports illustrated magazine
games are a let alone online
so this is why i think having technology is good in our society
plus you even go to your friends house and instead of laughing youl say
i feel that computers have negative affects and they should be gotten rid of completely
i think we have a problem
the computer have sites where you can talk to friends but that is no where as good as seeing them in person
the knowledge contained within them unknown
the last reason is that one
for some people this book they will or have even read this book several times i know i have
first computers are used for education around the world
most books read are the ones that are sad and sometimes gruesome but those are the stories that draw people in
at this point children our taking it very serious and strongly believing they can do the same
so next time you are using a computers think of all the things you are missing out in life
he always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination
viruses can hack you computer steal you personal info and destroy you computer
one because they can interact with others
of have never gone out into nature
she also explains her past with such detail and care
banning books would go against what our country stands for
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story
people think they are bad but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in
the effects of what come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read
computers are ruining us they deter our social skills damage our health and cause us to be lazy
these are all the reasons why computers are bad
that could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family
the internet a powerful weapon but can teens handle this kind of power
do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them
from out of our libraries for being offensive where would we draw the line between offensive and not
the library is full of many books for all ages
what ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete
he overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views
i can relate to this because i have also heard some things that i am not proud of such as foul language
the can help a student pass school
i personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing
if this book was pitched out of the library how would students all over the nation learn of the
we develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings
if we had all of this then there would not be any more problems
you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book but those people will just have to deal with it
computers be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends
when surrounded by new digital age
i also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book
computers can also provide entertainment for people
shows deep feeling towards nature
another great things about computers is that there are programs that allow you to talk to other people
in a summary i guess i could say that everyone has there own opinions and views
it is a very bad thing to have at a public place and that should not be aloud
we i have came up with what i think about it
i firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive
one can enjoy the walk
this could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library
what is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another
there are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question
as he comes one of us has to stay back and serve him
they think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too
materials at libraries should not be censored because the materials allowed at the libraries would decrease
he is like a friend and guide to the students
have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive
this is bad because he could become dehydrated
imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society
dear my name is and i do not no where to start this letter
we go to school for a vast amount of reasons
he seems happy because he talks about his parents his family and his home which make him happy
but meeting new people can also be good
books movies and music should not be removed from the shelves
but with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water
computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates
for example flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
and lastly they are the future of our world
i believe that computers have a negative effect
learning new things can only be interesting if you can actually see them
this often causes depression as it begins to sink in
when he leaves the factory he feels
they help organize your thoughts which stress
another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides too you
book hotels and airliners they even allow us to interact with our friends
why would anyone do this to themselves
the flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on but as the road changes to short rolling hills the biking becomes more difficult
and with that i conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people
for me it the whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message
some people should just stop taking everything so seriously then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading
in the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting
something she needed at such an ugly time for her
now what are you going to do with your life
the parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read listen or watch not a large group of people
these people can offend you
a computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds
we should plant more and more trees
dear you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one
the girl says that she is going to take the test again when the hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow
it is kind amazing how advanced our technology is how you send a message from to in a matter seconds
the people who support advances in technology are correct computers open up imagination and learning
these days come quite often but what does do
he should take care of his health
you can tell at first the mother is disappointed then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood
this is why the author wrote this memoir to thank his parents for what they did for him
in my opinion computers are handy but dangerous
people have learning talking and advances in technology with one click of a mouse
this action can help with sports
being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials
what then will you do
as he goes along his confidence starts to wither away
the second reason why i think using a computer is good is because some jobs you have to apply by computer
as the showers fade away once again winter sets in
well you cant online scans and some are free
true people exercise every day
while his music be offensive their are still many people that enjoy it
most people used computers
tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist
censoring books could take away from learning
you were smart you would not listen to those experts have you ever heard of the word multi tasking
because of that that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author
because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind
her mind was also starting to ware
and if was really bad be able to take it out of the school
could help you out a lot
the mood in this story is very happy
it makes research connecting with friends and your easy
computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations
for instance books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events
also they cut communication with your family making it rare to truly bond with them
i know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games
in conclusion the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character
dear the use of advanced computers have increased
due to unavoidable circumstances i had not been able to do any revision
this knowledge that you always hide from them be what they need to know later on and wont know when they need
well while we were busy playing mom and dad were busy as well
the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test
it also serves as a great place to exercise
if she will stick through it or not
this how computer help people talk with others around the world
you are probably using a computer to type the documents
there are many different types of books
the mood is basically is being happy with what you have
luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion
i think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing
the others are either buying things or playing games
if you think about it they can actually help you learn with all those different programs they have
censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually
lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving
so this is why i believe that having a computer is a good idea and good to have
for instance somebody goes home and checks their email
without physically bringing your textbook home you can view the book online
also if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch
computers are real useful
for example the cyclist reaches and fish camp he is able to hydrate once again
what do you consider an offensive book
as the world turns life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist
all offensive items a library have stored should stay in that very spot for learning purposes
it began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly
also written in our of we are given the right to say what we want and nobody can control that
it is as simple as that
this is easy for most people who have busy lives
i was going to die he says
everyone loves having a computer but have you ever thought what it can do to you
some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them
loving place that holds so many memories
the reason we now have shows on about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people
in opinion computers have a positive impact on the world around us
so how is it inappropriate for them to read fictional books that include the topic
they are also concerned that looking at the screen could be damaging to your eyes
all of these things in the setting affected the cyclist
the flower reminds her of her grandmother
i have showed you what you can learn about talk to people and socialize and lastly help you with your health
so leave everything on the shelves
i had too learn from my parents that the things i were doing was not rational
music is another thing
they are also used for several different things like downloading music on your
some are very educational and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others
books are usually good things although they can be very bad
therefore he was taught to become a king
the computer helps us learn about other places in the world
my friend was on his computer typing a report and then his computer shut down
or new shows and music all be find
floods are natural calamity and take place regularly in certain areas
the kid be underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate
dear local newspaper i think that computers are giving bad effects on peoples lives
lastly computers are like vampires sucking away your money
censoring books at a library is pointless you take away options and the experience to learn from certain books
went from just living there to it being his home
can we live without the computer
they follow what technology to make life
i know that you can break free from it because i once experienced the same thing
so the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels
libraries are one of the number one resources when researching reading or gaining information and knowledge
shelves that contain inappropriate books magazines and music will only make their number of customers drop
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story do not exceed posted speed limit
dear computers are destroying modern youth
so clearly computers are not our biggest problem
dear have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer
that is some of the things that can affect the cyclist
that is why i agree with computers give you benefits
school websites also give people benefits in our society
what if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow
the hibiscus is keeping her from giving up
the extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst
it could even help you
all of these libraries however have certain reasons to have these books
locating and researching even going to different countries even different continents is possible to do on the computer
the setting effects the cyclist in many ways
this posts the question is censorship a good thing or is bad
these really do not need to be exposed to our young children because
no it should not be removed
dear newspaper i think that computers have a positive effect on people here are my reasons
i have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy and i have also seen parents go the other way
if one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed another mother not
these benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why i support the advances in technology
just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad
we should always respect them
soon the fire brigade arrived
some of the material in the libraries are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive
i rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them
which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
just because i want to read the book does not mean you have to
things like and could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you
they are also avoiding nature outside and losing contact with family and friends
it is understood that there is both bad and good in the world and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that
are you a kid who spends to hours at a time on the computer
therefore students children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting
to him the sight was troubling
i had an experience similar to this with my friend
i think are very helpful because you can use them for emailing working and school work
i would hate to do that
also parents you computers for work or maybe to get away from work to take a vacation they need took book it some how
these experiences teach us to do as well as teach us not to do
people should spend a lot less time on their computer
these are just come of the many fun sports
what that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world
the person who wants in banned should have to tell everyone why and stuff
so we say a stitch in time saves us from having none stitches later on
also it helps people talk to people from different countries
the cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature
also i would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it
it is now or never you would never know if you can be that man in the hospital with that cancer
this makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades
the terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain
unfortunately he had to move away
so i decided not to remove the books from the shelves so the people who did not find them offensive could read them if they wanted to
i had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up
i do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer but it still has a totally positive effect on people the world
there was a sign that posted a max speed limit
it has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way
for this reason they should not check them out
in the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you
libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups
they are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it
last sunday my father had to go to the heathrow airport to receive his uncle
authors try to get you to understand the world around you not by trying to offend you in anyway
he also tells them about the countries where those fruits come
children have to learn these things some time in their life and i think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life
if a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book
people are able to send files ship even order online
i can see how censorship is very useful and important
she was lazy and never wanted to exercise
not just by talking on the phone
as you can see the features of the setting affect the cyclist
all you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard
after all the library is public and i put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different
another example is that public look up information about the world on my computer
finally people are slowly being their ability to communicate with family and friends
as he runs out of water the landscape and his surroundings start to get drier and drier
there are many bad things that result from computers
you have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions
the second problem is stealing music getting it for free
people will just play and play all day long
i remove the previously stated graphic romance novels
people should not be shielded from the real aspects of life
this concludes that computers benefit the society we live in today
there are various cycle sports at national and international level
a third reason people should not use computer is because they stop interacting with real people
cultures come in a variety we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home
when she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it
it was a horrible experience
finally a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something
all the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop about any topic he wants to learn
without the internet i probably would have lost my interest in
the adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room or on a different level of the building
the is a published work whether it is religious or not
computers were invented to benefit mankind not hurting and they are doing a great job
i believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials
dear i am a student from i do think that certain materials such as books
he gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir pride
so many things that they can do is run jog and go for bike rides
do you man out of people have
the flatland however morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting
know being safe is important
i have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids
this topic is about personal opinion and choice
take the book in the for example
people could assume that drugs kill you
long distance calls cost money and it is not worth a call if you call every couple of days
i also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests then they should just not look at it
computer you have to program it according to your requirements
in these instances these violent stories are important for our youth to see and i think that they should not be censored in the library
second you do projects on them or homework if you need to
for example in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall
he learned the true meaning of family
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way
lastly materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research
censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created
post offices are located in every town village and city
lastly people can learn about where their family corner form
the mood created by the memoir is shown by many things
is both proud and thankful of his parents
because that is getting away from what the over all message is about
we hired a boat and started rowing
the modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses
then and easily as rounding a band my troubles thirst and fear were all behind me
machines are a very bad influence on people
missed each other until i turned and was invented
i think that many children that watch movies especially that should not be exposed to them
it has to start somewhere every little start causes for a great ending
i will not dislike you for your opinion and i will not look at you any differently
that decision however is up to the parents
i think that only if there is real offensive stuff then it should be censored
but if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem
inside we boarded a small train which took us around the park
dear newspaper people are spending way too much time on the computer and it is not right
thank you for your time
with the facts i have stated they have supported my reasons
some people seem that it might be cool to be just like her
so i hope you will listen and also agree with me i think i made my point about how much you should use computers
we could look up who was the of in the would get multiple sites on the
no matter who you are or what you do internet plays an important part in life
recently i bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week
a lots of uneducated children that stay home or do drugs in the street
she seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits
this paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story
unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive it should be able to remain open to the public
now i understand there is a vast amount of people who are against my position
stories novels magazines or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves it is then our job to discover them
i know it will surprise you when i tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day
our future leaders are already glued to the games email and instant messaging of the net
computers are negatively affecting the population
the ending is a cliff hanger to show that her story has not yet completely ended
she also stopped reading the bible in her spare time to go on the internet
no late fees and no waiting lists
throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others
should we as peopleas normal citizens really decide what others are able to read
he will abuse of you or kill you
all in all i think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves
and then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us
a few years ago kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library
but how can you have an education with out a computer
i recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to
a lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all
computers are of many things for they you
i had gotten more information than the book
it is exhilarating to watch pouring rain and to run about in it
the student body would rather watch play video games or text than do homework
now even though i mentioned all those good things there are unfortunately bad ones too
it just is not fair to everyone else
for example in his story the of
let our not repeat itself
imagine if an woman brought her daughter of years into the library to find information about a school project
those are my reasons why computers are good
we require water for different purposes
dear newspaper i would like to tell you about computers without them this world would fall apart
dear local newspaper writer i believe that computers benefit our society because we could connect to people more faster and easier
dear readers of the local newspaper more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
in this type of setting it would be fine to allow any type of book in the adult section marked mature
he described this with sentences like rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain
was always happy because he was always a part of a family
a good example of this is the popular internet video site
also using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers
some people games and play
the parents on the other hand might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age
with computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day
think of it in your own perspective
you become more if you go more it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids
it allows you to quickly talk a person without waiting for reply for more than days
then it disrupts that persons study
censorship should come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear
on the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing
they are warping the minds of people all over and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be
censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others
they allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks
so the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite
so they can talk to their friends
the computer helps many different people in many different ways
some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but i for one disagree with that statement
let alone read about it in school
but if kids are introduced early we would not have to keep it a secret anymore
my attitude will go farm
can you believe that this tiny piece of technology is influencing our everyday life
the cyclist runs into some pretty tough challenges
another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now
some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves
music should stay on the radio or in stores not in libraries
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
computers believe it or not are on easy and way to maintain contact with far away people
therefore history is taught in schools so that the bad events that occurred in history can be prevented
sometimes your letter is even lost and these is no way of finding out
if you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more
nothing can be brought to a conclusion without punctuality
also the same with magazines and music
putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs
like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories
their was no way i could find out way the was killing the people over in that town
my last reason why i think people spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends
the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful
but as mentioned earlier censorship should only be to a certain degree
as you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life
violence in books seem to spread across schools
first of all if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them
do what makes you happy and nothing else
taxis buses and scooters were parked outside
the mood described in this memoir is mostly about love unity and culture
several great leaders such as the first president of the decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country
the cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with his name written over them
and that is bad enough
he tells the reader more than enough about his simple home and there is almost no conflict in this memoir
he is the master of his subject
they say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker
in rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclists was effected by the features of the setting
dear i think that computer are a waste of time but they also help you in many ways
the library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material so that people nor children have to see them
a third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people
communication is one of the greatest things about computers
and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered
we as members of the are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not
everywhere so much of noise is there and the people have grown insensitive and are not affected by this
well having a computer allows this to happen
but in a small village there is one post office only
its a easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even you family
there are those of a select few however who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes
people can stay away from those areas that they find offensive
these are the reason i think computers have a bad effect on people
if they do not like it then they should have never taken it home in the first place
which i find really weird because things like that are going to happen in life
the features of the setting affected the cyclist
the whole memoir is looking fondly back at his home that he grew up in
but the farther his trip went the hotter and less water supply he had left
its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that
more and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies
of all my reason that computers are bed this is by far the most disturbing
first i think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic
we cannot even describe what is lost for the knowledge has vanished
my grandfather gifted me this car last christmas
the answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas concerns and experiences
materials such as books music movies and magazines are used for peoples enjoyment
computers help people create listen to watch and make music and
this creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them
you can be alone on the computer in a dark room
young minds get corrupted by reading trash
also some people who type super fast go to get test to see how fast they type the test gives numbers like seventy words a minute
yes computers are fun giving but is bad
we teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs
i know for a fact us teens watch funny movies to make our rough day turn into a better day well that is what i do at least
this can go on and on
man is a social animal
but now with a computer all that can change
some information sensitive but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the itself
they get the cramps form typing to fast hard and too long
i love the big aircraft t the airport
the computer makes this easier for us to do
the best way is to play lots of education video games
we are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations
just look around you they show it in movies they talk about it in books
i believe that computers do not benefit society
then after a few hours the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills
could also chat online
two they can look up things to help them
second being on a computer makes you stay inside
must learn in order to teach
another reason computers are good is because you can talk to friends and family who are far away using something called
should be taken out of the library
if anyone violates the rules and is not in uniform or makes mischief he gets punished
adults need to see what there kids read this days
the government should not get all the say in this series matter in hand
why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids
the company wants to make money and so does the author
his water supply is almost gone
when the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth
libraries are places people visit to check out and read books
computers are electronic devices all information stored as patterns of electrical pulses
a great mental image of serenity and peace
movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on
the plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter
there are a few reasons for this
just about everyone has one
the computer goes beyond just allowing you to talk enables you to connect with people no matter where you are
his parents let all who needed a home to stay with them because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter
would you ever read a book about the times if your
one little law change in could cause great negative changes in the future
of complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house
in the past books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful
a clueless society is a useless society and in the end they were destroyed
everyone in the twenty first century uses a computer
music is almost the only thing you can calm you down so that you can focus again
also explains about his community and the diversity there
there are many things we can do to stop our children from watching listening and learning about these negative things in life
if the book or movie is found offensive to you pick another but it should not be removed from the shelf
the children rush out of their classrooms
censorship in libraries
in the example i used in the paragraph above that actually happened to me
to them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other
floods however have always brought out the best in men
if someone has just been rushed to the hospital for an emergency computers will be used to monitor that person
in that case we could not send aid to the area
in the memoir the mood created the author in the memoir
it was hard for him to keep going being dehydrated so bad but he had to
at school we use computers all the time
a few months ago i spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours
in a house with too many servants or masters there wiil be no order
outside it was warm and sunny
i have a broad view on this subject
my class teacher distributed sweets among the children and teachers
this particular theme is no matter how hard something might be you can get through it
many more things that offend people are always going to be there
he not only made the thing but also strove for perfection
you use computers to edit and put together your paper before printing
there are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship
books help people escape the harsh world we live in or help them gain more knowledge
the banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge
parents should have enough sense to pay attention and thus the problem is solved
among the animals we can include goats lambs hares or rabbits also
it is the responsibility of the library employees to put these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building
he was the first president of the
if you keep doing other activities you can get skinny again easily
so how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment
the next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out
the features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically
all of these reasons come together and say the computer does benefit society
last example is if want to see the person and talk to them so you can go webcam with them and even talk
that of people use the computer to chart with people
also is expressed throughout this memoir
this reminds me of a time when my brother went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing
i can sister talking how they had that has to be taken using a computer
people or not agree with this but everyone is entitled to their own opinion
a synonym for solidarity is unity so here the author is even saying how his neighborhood all united into one big happy neighborhood
using a computer helped hand eye coordination
these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today
if everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left
computers really are the best electronic in the world
people bargain with him before buying things
for example he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed
another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills and then comes across a rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit sign
teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each
families relationships are being ruined and peoples health is at steak
all the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist
i like to play with my kittyi love her very much
he was in the desert which is dry and hot
that is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist
hours sitting at the computer replaces healthy exercise are all spending our lives on the computer and sitting and clicking is not exercise
it is as simple as that people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them
is happy in that memoir because only revisits memories that was fond of
the next time you are in the library looking for a book ask your self one question is it to offensive to be important
if they start taking out big parts of history it will be long lost and forgotten
all kinds of people buy things that they like
he believes that he is not going to make it
he is also my neighbor
however are you really gaining any social skills by doing this
everything is for educational purposes
they teach hand eye coordination
thereafter he decided to find a way to overcome the cause of suffering
i sow seeds in the vacant space and water them
it is a word that can ban music from stores books from shelves and movies from theaters
you can share you want with people you barely see
books and magazines be offensive but they also entice the reader
i can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because i see it everyday with my younger brother
unlike sending and writing letters to people instant messaging is a much faster and easier way to talk to another person
on television hear it on the radio or see it in the newspaper
the video has been viewed over million times
if they are in our libraries how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school
beautiful flowers around their neck
we learned a lot from this fair
my sister got her first job by going on the museums website and applying right there on the computer
in bookstores or even libraries they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate
censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent
but today literature has gone down a new course
i now have to worry about what we check out
the beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now
multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things
so trying to shield your child from the bad things be a great thing but the efforts are usually failed attempts
computers are a great help for projects email vacation spots and so on
its like this everyone has their own taste on what they like
if books were not offensive people would read them very often
the family loves this plant
for example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up
finally computers can also be used to learn new information
as you can see computers are very helpful for students but are they good for teachers too
furthermore advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people
in conclusion i believe that censorship should not be used in libraries
therefore i think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph
he easily passes the snake and moves on
decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was aloud to practice their right to speak freely the idea of censorship was not in the plan
they start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are
that is what his parents they always help people when they need it
computers have a positive influence on people
the dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever
if all books had to be appropriate for every age it would take all the interesting out of everything
although it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice
he had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat
books are so very important to us and our world
every years my dad takes me to the track in and times me for and yard dash the meter and the mile
statistics how or people help online instant or going in
some they know in real life or some they met online
bad people are out there and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day
they never helped any one unless their palms were greased
they should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem the lack of education
we would be taking away a lot of stuff the our children should know about such as the slavery and famous people
the ground becomes slippery
pink are my favorite
one of my good friends is years old has two jobs her own apartment with her boyfriend and is not supported by either of her parents
then i learned to not abuse the computer not waste my time on it
however there are still people who think that computers do harm
it restrict the of the audience and of the writer which prevents growing experiences for both
this illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past
you can also watch movies or shows that you missed or want to watch again
in conclusion computers do have a positive effect on people around the world
not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them
computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends
so this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age
to make matters worse the terrain changed from flat road to short rolling hills
there was some flog and not much traffic on the road
the topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one especially with younger kids
i disagree with when she said that some books magazines movies etc
all in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public
people have to be careful of what they say and i feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging
these are some good pros
another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them
in this story the feeling on nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope
if we take away one kind of music then we have to take away every kind of music
there are too many of these tales to pick out even one
then at the end in seven his tone is once again loving and grateful
not only that but we need computers for school
finally computers provide you with so much knowledge and is great for education
looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book
they can do and research whatever they want
it is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story
first he described his childhood home
video games make you think that is also reason they are good
if books are being offensive it can just easily hurt anyone reading that book
if you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook
without the computers most of us would not no about world news
computers make it easy to communicate
without a computer life would be much more difficult
he discovered how to send radio signal by using invisible electric waves
even though some people not take offense to any type of you have to think about the parents
after about miles on the cold his life was getting low and he came to his second abundant place
thus computers can allow you to get information efficiently
that means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were
my grandma said to my mom
the last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard
many parents have different rules for their children then others and they not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout
to choose what they want to read or watch
it also teaches us not to what these people are doing
almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you
this site was trebling
from three oclock till ten oclock playing chess with strangers from all over
it is a right to be able to obtain the information theses materials offer
so no there should absolutely not be any censorship in a library
who is to say what is or is not offensive
these are the things you should have
they communicate there more than they could without computers
his babysitter was his first friend that lived above him and graced his kitchen with meals
i blame that grade on not having a computer at home
computers take time away from exercising enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends
you can do this through via email
all of the computers were filled with people and a line with people ready to go on next
well instead of going through a book and possibly searching for hours finding that information on the internet would be so much faster
is a good place to get computers so is t
i know that there are so many things that could offend people
second it keeps customers happy
the narration of rough road ahead a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story
watching old reruns of the

this shows how sad and depressed she was because the tone the statement was said in was a sadder more depressed tone
dear newspaper i think that there are many reason why computers are good for people
in libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be
being an adult one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and the judge of what they are going to let their children watch
the butterfly starts it’s life in an egg
as you can see computers are very important
my mom goes to school and she tells me how she never has time to study because she always on the internet
she also made a song taunting me everyday about how i looked
those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read
she hopes she is right about the flowers maybe she likes the spring
for game system its like having a computer right
you with their friends and family anymore
like if it is really hot or cold is it a good experience for kids anything you want the computer has it
a better word for that would be they censor you
with modern technology
we need the different opinions in life
to get the recommended dose of a day you only need to absorb minutes of sunlight a day
there is another way of cheating copying others work essays or articles form a website
this would result in a in high grades
there are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family
before people starting using computers to research topics ideas they would use books
not everyone agrees with that
i visit the library every time after i finish my book i have loved reading from the time i was little

i am ready to study and work hard to fulfill my dream of flying high among the stars
censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians
often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics
because computers give you the ability to talk to friends family and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so

the mood given by the author in this memoir is happiness
now the question comes what if its the best book or movie up there
pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have main component computers
this paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers
computers is the big thing because we need to look up a lot of things online we need computers to test on
most of these books resulting to violence
computers have been the big difference when comparing to centuries
if the worry is concerning youth parental guidance should be in affect

and with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success
lastly computers give you something to do in your free time such as playing games

i remain confined to my room
we all learn something everyday and with the computer we can make it kind
when asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest
people want to say whatever they want and they have the right to
it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them
free from temptation and independent human beings
and finally help with schooling
that we need them to communicate to other people
nobody likes a distant family but with a computer you can communicate with family and friends from all over the world
however she lost interest over time
the mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft happy and mood
the way that the mood shows love is in and
these help inspire people
you want to go and look you your favorite hockey player
first of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you cant do anything
the new technology is amazing like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures they do have negative effects
try to make a difference
exercise is important for the mind and body
see now i have a since of humor
the mood created by the author in the memoir
we also use the computers for the programs they have
also i stay in touch with my dad who works in
no body ever said that they had to buy what the person in front of you is buying
local newspaper please consider my opinion i feel that computers benefit are society
now and day people are using social networking sites like and to talk with people far away
that is for you to decide
as you can see technology these days is always getting more and more advanced
in the story he writes the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
the modern bathroom had good cold water
everyone has found something offensive throughout their life
should be removed from the shelves
we need to show them that we care
with a computer with a dose drive you can watch any
that does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book
teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed
as you can see computers are extremely educational
the settings elements greatly effect the cyclist in this story
why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices
i could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf
as mentioned before if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience it should be placed in an adult section
because this man is very rich he has lots of material wealth
also a computer can be accessed right in your name so no travel is required
these ideas and quotes show the features of the setting of the cyclist
as much as they should get information on it have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing
it is not healthy for you or anyone else
last but not least watching tv take a lot of time and it makes us lazy
once when i was in a library i was offended by a book title that was against my religion
it also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from
to some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life
to sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination
like making holiday and birthday cards
they start to talk and become good friends
so i strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library
they get on an they stay on forever
there was a beautiful river
his main problem is the lack of water
here are my reasons why
because of the computer we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event
they can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain
but do you see that every day in this generation not at all
in libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive
you race back to the library only to find out that it is closed
then why can’t he understand that animals too don’t like such hurtful treatment
this can also affect the way people lively
how about what reminds you of home
some people think it is a good idea and same do not
even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned people would still complain until what they want happens
computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports
this is good depending on how long it takes
however these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries
it helps you at work for a job and at school
i would let them know how i felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner
such as current events the history of our nation and how our government works
instead we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline
when kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing
some people even on them to stay in touch with family or at war
but thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project
computers can also help by talking to people
he sits at home on his computer all and plays games goes on and
the setting effects the cyclist very much
we as people of the have battled through hard times
there was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere
it has helped one as a student
we still have time for family friends and any fun outdoor activity
items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it
i believe this because other people be interested in it we need information from the resources in the libraries and all books make people more intelligent
the world wide web unlimited socialization and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers
one the only ways she can contact her father is through
i hate arrogance also
another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down
third you can learn new exercise moves or tricks
one way is to get the local libraries to participate in putting restrictions on the cards of young children
could tell that his parents love him very much and is grateful for that
as you can see i agree that computers are a bad idea
in addition from using computers for jobs some people like to chat online with a friend that move away
you know that you want to
if you show a woman that same piece of clothing she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing
my second reason why has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying
positive effects computers have are that they are quick and reliable and they are fun to use
and families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff
second you can talk to old friends and keep in touch with new ones
using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone
computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click
movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them
you want my opinion on the effects computers have on people
can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood
that is where the computer can help
nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations but hopefully everyone does so on their honor
if he runs out of water he will die
i believe all books would be fine left on shelves
when girls look at a model in a magazine they try and be just like the model
everyone has the right to these materials
finally computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business
the second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect
but in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most
they are always full of people
i can just go on the computer and search whatever i want
you have the power to make a difference in your real lives
like i said everyone is different
these two sentences give the reader feelings of safety and once again emphasize care
i think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain
the author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir
if you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it
this is the harvesting season
they give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away
now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners
another example was he felt warm because of that
there are people out there that might disagree with me and i can see where they are coming from too
do you like what i like
physically he was tired and worn out
some say it is a great idea and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living
the rough terrain also led to her using own strength to get up and down hills and to get plants and animals
dear i think that children are spending to much time on the computer for the wrong reasons
if we could when people are checking out these books movie magazines etc
they can help us learn new things we all can meet new people
they would never of learned such things
so how can people still think computers are good
for example my dad works for and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world
just use your computer keyboard to type and send a message
the hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes
he wants us to obey the law of the land
when people push aside their social time for computer games chat rooms or movie websites they lose a large portion of their life
you realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it
to begin computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise
that could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test
last reason of why i think computers are useful is that they help you get a hold of family and friends
no the books and etc
lately a technology buzz has hit all over the world
on computers you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them
the computer makes life a little easier and its fun too and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper
as the cyclist goes on his trip he is met with many dreary places and people
it should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated
without having to lock down at the keyboard
an advantage of using it in school means so much to the people and there education computers have changed the human race forever
all of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many ways
censorship is really unavoidable and it should not be an issue
not all things online are like that though
the flower represents her
if the whole community disagree with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it
of course you everyone does
due to the advance in computers many people do not go outside as much anymore
the computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other
by using the computer for more than one hour a day your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase
another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do
so i believe that certain materials such as books music movies magazines etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive
yeah on playing counter strike
both of those books are by the author
this shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life
you can also use them to meet new people
it let me know how other families who really have nothing have everything
so if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern and try to have something done about it
they also have music that has explicit lyrics on the
it is saying that when everything else starts coming to life she will also accomplish something
he also says over one long crippling hill
now a days out of people are over weight or obese
my last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day
this shows how special the house was to him
their house was permanently open to whoever needed it and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them
every time her friends asks her about email she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject
second of have better things to
when the sun sets the darkness follows
sure there are books to take notes on people but do books type up papers
when someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take
also if you had to look up a person for a school project
the most thing that matters in his life are family
sohan lal is the peon of our school
so as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people ways that they do this is that they are educational they help learn
this sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired thirsty and hot
however the author started to reveal hints that would accept and find come childhood memories there too
he was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves
no one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas
i think that computers have a bad effect on people
if it had not been at the library what would i have done
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist
there would be no more internet
the terrain really affected the
they even indulge in many criminal activities
to begin the computer is yet another distraction to our daily lives
statistics show that more than of have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped on grading scale
throughout the entire year i video chat with her through computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there
my dad introduced me to classic rock and my mom loved soft rock
they need to have a section where offensive booksmagazinesmusic and movies go
do you have family members who live far away from you
next up is the rough terrain
they help us get information for a project at school records direction etc
how unfair it would to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person
censorship in libraries
i think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people
do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away
to most people they are going to want to take those kinds of books off of the shelf
and they can look up whatever they like
it also sopped the energy out of him further complicating his ride
just be safe in doing it
could use it for related could use it for
honestly i totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the because of many reasons
are some good reasons why computers are good and help you
you should keep it on the shelf for the people who want to actually read it or just want to read it to see what its all about
when i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom
had high doubt when saying that quote
a material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it
a computer is just a simpler way to look up information
her mother will be proud of her
that section is only for mature people of the ages or older
taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative inventive and inspired world
censorship solves no problems but it makes everyone unhappy
dear out of ten people spend their time on the computers
i think there will be something done but it will take time
when my brother first got his computer he literally locked himself in his room for days
but i also learned to be responsible with it
in almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative
it teaches you thing but not every thing it teaches is good
spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people
everyone is into different materials books and stuff
well i dearly hope your answer benefits the children in
another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long
most of the time people are home bound but need a job
also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer
then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by
it can also help you with your job
on my begging forgiveness he let me go with just a word of advice
in the desert people feed camels with grass grains wheat and oats
even though these people think they are overused they still use them
there is something out there everyone will enjoy
then we saw rhinos and giraffes
it involves the sacrifice of time and thoughts
addiction online bullying and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a there are many more
computers made that event possible
if we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries what would we have left
finally there are not any buildings in sight
the hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese
even for the books that are unrealistic they are also made for a reason and should be allowed to have their place in the library
in the past their have been more negative effects on people
he just explained how he was very thankful for how his parents raised him and the lessons that his parents taught him
so keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them
lastly computer and in technology can allow people to chat
the technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast easy enjoyable way
for example the war in or more recently the and earthquakes
libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way
this is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation but free of charge
exercise is important to your body and computers are not
by banning these works of art you are banning individuality as a whole
she is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus
i have been to the library many times whether it be by myself or with others
in the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same
i believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive
it is a very watchful bird
also the cyclist was biking in the heat
the feeling could be described as homey
a favorite book of many kids is the series
in addition most people use computers
also they have friends that go over for dinner and often bring some food over with them
in conclusion computers help our society in a lot of ways
also we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech
let man choose what is intolerable to him
have you wanted to go to
in life we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face
another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race everyone got along and help others out
computers have changed over the years from to have
we have the choice to pick what we read and listen to
now i talk to him all the time
thank you for your time
first the printer can break
another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material
for one the has the most obese children in the world
also if you are a parent that has children they always need help
parents need to watch what there kids read and watch on a daily basis
ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section
he tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are
the motivation is the flower bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her
our earned us our freedoms we can not let censorship take them away
it went up almost from year and from the year before
well with computers you can do that you can just search the place and see what the place has
because of computers people are spending too much time on computer and less time doing things that are better for them
when he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself my gosh what did i get myself into
the factor of weather rolling hills and the shortage of water take a tall on him
one out of five people wear glasses or contacts these days
sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive
there were no cars buildings or people
throughout the years many events have taken place in our history
in my opinion there is so much to gain and learn from a computer
nothing because there is freedom of speech
was happy with his decision as well
this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves
in the wide open desert the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles
but eventually with right leadership it would help make a more truthful environment
instead of censoring the books we should censor the people reading the books
there are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong
mr joseph was up mother offered him tea
from my own experience people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period
i also have many friends
affect the cyclist in many ways
the second reason i think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music
a book not read as well never have been written
at points the setting mode the author feel depressed and sad and at other times happy and joyful
the mood created by the author in this memoir is love
on a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people
another reason why computers are is because you can type essays papers change you of computers are bad to computers make us
during summers he grows rice cotton and jute
computers the time they are the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can
no one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another
when you just want to see someone il costs you money to get on a phone
books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves
i believe that computers have a positive effect on people
some people are just stubborn
that is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love
lastly computers can just be plain fun
they have all types of game systems out there just for computers
when she saw the hibiscus the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home
you can live without then very easily and without them the world would be a better place
it part of life though
one affect was the lack of water in the area he was in which was a dessert
computers are too important and beneficial to lose
his relationship with others in the family and society give him an identity and provide a psychological satisfaction
the man started becoming very unsure
nonot in my opinion and i hope not in yours either
this nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to
i think chatting online is great but dangerous
or at least try to do the same
no one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
magazines can also be educational
people are not being made to read and watch what offends them
in agriculture we should not overuse chemicals
they need to show respect for the books movies music and magazines they provide for kids teenagers and parents
a use for computer that is also use full is hand eye coordination
if the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such that could mean things
people get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese
they are not a waste of our time
however some people can take what the says to be offensive in regards to homosexuals and divorces
a library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred
a and computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise
my future children and i could also never be able to read it
people need computers to get updated on important issues contact others and learn new information
there are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offensive
also the chat can translate the language thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone
another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money
also as us kids are growing up we have too many advantages because of computers
the setting affects the cyclist because it is hot therefore he gets thirsty
someone else not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material
another reason why i think the author made this the last paragraph is this
also a user increased light bill and wont spend time interacting
eventually i came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book
first of all computer are very helpful with typing skills
another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health
my there reasons are to look up information home work and to talk to friends and family online
the first example of this is in they are riding on hills it makes it much harder for them
he also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things
who would want to go to a library with all the same books
they cost a lot of money cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy and teach children that things come easy in life
if they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them
lastly as a kid we need to be able to use a computer not just to talk to friends but for homework
children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior
do you love to have friends overseas
the alarm clock wakes me up early in the morning
they spend their pocket money and relish sweet dishes
computers help us do that
the author was trying to show how she can change and grow just like her plant
using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature
knowing you have people who are like family is incredible
first thing we should discover is how many people like books movies or music like that
a world with a full education for our children to take advantage of and a place where we can stay with each other all the time
the computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world
this started to trouble him
the setting is active just like the cyclist
all your doing is staring at a screen
the part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time
the setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict
for example if i logged onto chat room someone might ask for personal information such as where you live your phone number your name
on television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff
with different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things
for instance the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips
being able to communicate with one another makes theses people happy and benefits society
if censorship is allowed what is to come is frightening
the new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over
the old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns
so what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library
out there and yes they are certainly fun and healthy
even at times the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming
what did was instead of trying to deal with the picture she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures
his children also live a simple life
this is because we would get less exercise less time to enjoy nature and interacting with family and friends
but the most important part of using a computer is to enjoy it and have fun
they look for knowledge and taking away a persons learning capacity can be harmful to everyone
more and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because of movies and what people say in books and in magazines
that is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups
as you can see now computers are great influence to our lifestyle
it should not be a big deal on what there about
so i think their benefits our society
teach your children to be careful in what they read
they teach hand eye coordination give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise
she looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad
so this is why effects education
not only can they be time consuming computers can also be dangerous
but people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values
that is why the author ended it like she did
his music is just i of his life
i have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them you learn new things
the computer has games internet and ways to talk to people that get then attached
they are useful because they tell us about the world
most places have what they call late fees
the third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what they could get and made their house into a home
nothing that has to be done can be so trivial as to do it sloppishly
when kids say it outta class rooms they get in trouble
the mood created in this story shows how family should be
this is how happiness gratefulness and unity created a mood in this memoir
there are many times in the memoir when author created a mood
being with ones you know and love is much more beneficial because computers drag you in you are taken away from the real world
so as i conclude my letter to you the north courier i shall restate that i do support technology because they do have positive effects on people
computers can teach children by showing them new words colors shapes and sizes
what so you think about this
one positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate
enjoying the topic or material is optional
i also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new technology
take interest in their life and shower love unconditionally on them
every single person has the right to be heard
everyone has there own freedom
you can find any certain time in history and have a whole site on it
like foreign places or movies
you thought that way you thought wrong
it ruins your marriage if you are married
we are a middle class family and my home also belongs to the family background
so i asked her if i could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well
two days ago i did a video chat with my grandparents back in it was great
for magazines they should have all types of magazines
thank you for taking your time to read my opinion and i hope i helped
in freedom is important and we expect it freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests
this was an obstacle that he had to overcome
and with this family came the good times
without computers this would will be nothing
their is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally
please understand the meaning how terrible computers are
lastly some adults would be upset of the removal of some books
there was a on a shelf and she put it in her player
you would probably wonder why such a thing would happen
they need to be written read and selected to be published
first he got information from the old people
even what to do and what not to do
for one thing if you need to find out a important fact date or time
children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output
but if you are hooked on the computer as so many of us are you just not spend enough time with family and friends
there are many moods in this memoir
i think computers are better than books and dictionary because you can do all that stuff on a computer
if you live in and you want to have a trip to the this deal is really good
we feel healthy and happy
using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever
not kids have ways to find out what their going to be in live
my uncle is one of those people
more and more teachers are using computers to help us learn
computers are somewhat good but are very to you health
in this world you never know what someone might writing
the sun was setting down on him it was hot he had no hope
if a library has educational music why not keep them in there
and some parents is not going to let their children watch a movies and other movie they were not to see at there ages
in fact i just got invited to a party yesterday over
experts say that people are starting to spend to much time on the computer and less time in the real world
i think that overall anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries
this gave me a sense of how in times of struggle people will come together and help each other push through
you can find history on almost everything from the past to the present
we started crying now we still best friends
also when i go on the computer
do you really think need computers to live
there is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer and as far as advances in technology this is only the beginning
one incident of my childhood is indelibly printed in my mind
in the morning nature is at its best
computers have everything any info you need get it off of the computer
what does an offensive book look like
if you want to find out anything you can find it on the internet
i think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again
that get me to my next point
maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense but not all readers would take it easily
this brings me to say that books music magazines newspapers etc
artists authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice it is their freedom of speech
she buys the flower and returns to her new home to her mother who is working in the garden
what is your choice to this difficult question
finally computers can teach you life lessons by reading articles another person wrote
the should never be allowed to decide what the public views
lot of people have different of computers are more improve more faster and more high quality
not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else
expenses and income are saved to businesses computers if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined
the setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through
you are given technology advantage so why not use it
people ignore their parents when on computer
these day if not then of house designers use computers
this will drastically change how we learn about news
have you ever walked down the street and saw someone the size of a boulder
computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world
these sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continue a conversation from minutes ago
in paragraph it explains how he is happy about his life
you need to have steady hands
he is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it
i hope you consider this
once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting
the setting of the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude
a couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable
some students showed gymnastic exercises
on computers you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of
it is impossible to please everyone so what should be done
now that i have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience
i feel that we should all take a stand against computers
his parents taught him that anybody you can trust his family anybody that you help because you know they will do the same for you
for example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends
some books that are censored have great educational value
others are concerned that people spent too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and spending time with friends and family
mood in this memoir is enjoyable
in conclusion social abilities are up with computers
it is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated
just like any ordinary store there are items in a library that are not subject for children
today millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage
the computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy
it helps you to not look down
not spending much time can have a big effect on mother nature
with webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them
next reason why effect computers on people is positive is because it helps people communicated with friends or family
i hope this helps you with you questions about how computers effected people
you want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean
out of people use the computer every single day and out of people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys
censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day
scary movies are not real and some books too
i have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers
this hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next
they affected his confidence his energy and his determination
one person with a mouse a keyboard and a monitor
and this is only the beginning of what our lives would like without the computer
some people believe removing items at a library should be allowed but i strongly disagree
picture this you are overwhelmed by all the papers on your desk
there are much worse things on television
and then we have no books on the shelf for any of us
you can also have conversations through email with no problem
people that think those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
a censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library
so please do your part by spreading the word
they are the staple food in our diet
the author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country
it has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone
that is why i think computers are good
in just hour i visited right from my very own house
in this is how we could censor books in libraries
in conclusion the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving
there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents
a cat is also known to be the best pet
social activity is good for everyone
so remember even though computers are
computers also act as a research tool
they can find out what the weather is like so they know how to puck when going places
i do agree with this because with our countries of obesity
if you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to
i totally disagree with this letter
they always had more then people at the dinner table and always more then people staying at their house
they could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about
in the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist
the purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners
we are so fortunate today to have even computers in our school because my grandparents would have loved to have something as quick and as simple as a computer
last but not least he is happy because he lives with everyone he loves
his duty is very hard therefore he should be paid a respectable salary
imagine playing baseball with a friend who lives miles away from you while still being a kid in or set in your exercise adventure
i still do not see why it is such a big deal of reading uncensored material
soon my temperature rose i felt hot and restless
the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist
overall i think computers have a positive effect on society
not only can you learn a lot from computers you can communicate with people from different countries
in conclusion i believe computers effect our society in a positive way
when people grow up they tend to start reading watching and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to
disrespectful acts cussing and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment
some experts are concerned that people are using too much time on the computers
obesity leads to many such as dogged arteries or strokes
if this is true i certainly thing we should censor we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library
why should books that some people enjoy to read be removed off of library shelves
he took a shortcut but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated
this function keeps kids in touch and active
as said his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family knowing that they would do the same for them
most importantly computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment
for example when she said then i will take that test again
all in all having computers is a great investment
it shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do
the cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain
you can also see majority of people like what they got
because computers help people are reliable and can educate people
to whomever this concern almost everyone has them
certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason
that means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family
there were shops of bangles readymade garments toys and sweets
all information is helpful in some way
secondly movies on computers can be a real time if you want to around
what would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds
his father is a doctor
the desert was also hot and dry
computers cause people to be lazy
in fact of must teens do so
well all these things and more can be solved by using the computer
the times do go outside is for simple tasks such as taking out the trash
during his lifetime was ruled by kings so if he wanted to be successful he had to appease the
books always have reviews so people can tell if those are too or not
i find in the to be dangerously inappropriate
a sport that requires a lot of this is
family time is an treasured value to the people but lately computers are ruining this tradition
however not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences
it would solve all issues in my opinion
you could search up a lot of stuff
they tell about how they were born into a simple house
offensive material will be out in the world
certain items such as magazines and newspapers and books some of these items are held at a public level
the library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us
you can chat with your friends you have a webcam you can video chat with friends
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit written by the the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling
they have libraries so you can pick out books and other materials that you like
some being to learn to get us ready for college and to be independent
i mean i love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells
they can adjust to new things and new surroundings
i have read it and was not offended
it is not very funny to the person being teased
the plant and the geese represent symbols to her
if we cant deal with these problems first then computers will turn out to be a bad thing
being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth
an example of one such occurrence is in the short story winter hibiscus
people need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity but as a place for giving children joy
students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines movies music and books someday in their lifetime
if this continued we would have no books to read
then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will return to take the test again
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways
another example is he was deserted
so much is missed because of computers
are there materials that are acceptable for adults but not kids
some people do not agree that computers are good
should be removed from the shelves
tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find
libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning
she will take that drivers test then
computers are a more positive thing than negative
the internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life
the mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one
it varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read
if we want to learn about something we should be able to
another example is communication
yet parents lot the children on them
lastly i think it gives a feeling for the whole story
once a teenager or child view all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood
we do not really have a lot of movies in our school library but i do know that there are some in the town library
over time libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports researching renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read
computers are advancing and so are their uses computers are great and they are not our thought process or went to run around outside and play sports
on computers there are lots of games to play that are free
why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known
the main reason why i am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends
dear newspaper the question is whether or not people are spending too much time on the computer or not
in conclusion society needs computers in order to look up info as well as talk with friends and co workers
i hope that you and i see eye to eye in this matter advancing computers are our friends not the enemy
thanks to slavery became illegal in the
what is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult
which can cause people to loose time and friends
that is also causing childhood obesity
that way friendships are never really lost
people do not appreciated nature as they used to as they should
this is why i agree with computers
instead libraries should be divided into sections based on topics
the librarians or a national book association could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age
its not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone
therefore we must recognize that we have to survive and live together
the is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs
as i said before if they do not like it then they are not required to look at it
i have computers but we have books for a reason no spank pop ups or no distractions while working
i think that the hibiscus is an can of hope and inspiration to her
also if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on
should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library
i think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things
he teaches many classes
we all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to
we can all learn so much from the computer and there are so many people who their jobs on computer
lastly computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world
one thing about movies that i like are they are good for visual aids
in the book books are outlawed
they can change all they want but in the end it still happened
again this argument might go both ways meaning one less book would be off the shelf or many would be newly stacked aside from the others
a philosophic approach towards life will cultivate through prayer
all this has been done with ease before we could even on a light bulb
just off the top of your head how people do you know that use or
for example toddlers and children can use programs such as
i miss my garden when i am in kuwait
also the hot air can dehydrate him which can cause him to pass out
in the past everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them
the author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength
i can even see how my cousin in is doing
dear newspaper i am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country
lastly computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel
we would have to hand write those books and hand sew our clothes
i am proud of my friend
i want to explain to you how i feel about computers personally
and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others
for example my grandparents live in
because the girl is willing to try again and to not give up no matter what
like i said i have a computer and i can use it to help me write
the government has the right to control what we partake in but does that seem fair
dear local newspaper have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings
she preferred horror movies and i historical
in the world there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to
its just a dam book let us read them
it is useful to interact with people of other nationalities
computers are like keys they open doors to new places and ideas
everyone likes different things and some others not always agree with what they are going to be interested in
the best thing we can do is protest it and hope that it will start fading from the public some day
they were starting to get hot than tired
as far as music movies and magazines go that could be a different story
the feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one the conditions of the road were awful
it the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning
you can look up the weather for that time
that is why the author ends this story the way they did
when people are on the internet they could learn just about anything they want to on the giant mass of information we call the internet
they are not happy with the way you treat them
you could get a medical degree on the internet
taking advice from a group of old men he headed to his first stop
when someone something they watch the screen not their hand
which is kind of sad if you ask me
this is why i take great advantage of typing my paper every chance i get
however we can change the way that we view these people
the movie was full of inappropriate words therefore i had to shut it off
in and a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book
did you know that adults learn their knowledge about the environment politics and other basic information from the computer
dear i understand that more and more people use computers and that can have a good side and a bad one
not to mention computers cost way too much money
makes people stupid and makes you lazy
instead on some chips while typing
when you sit in front of a computer it reels you in
you pay for the computer outright but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep
the eldest son helps him in the business
lastly children are missing out on the beauty of nature
not all of them are for the eyes of every person out there
they both planted the flower and got a sense of relief
see your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you
this is not good because when you go outside it helps skin health from the sunlight lets in fresh air for your lungs
the features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot
all of this hard work can cause heatstroke kill him
i hope after reading this you will agree with my position
now say you came back and attack the problem again
our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years
the overall mood to this memoir was that the family gets to share so many great and fun moments together
so people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now
as we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press
you can have a video family
these books should be kept far away from are children
family say your child is out school day
it is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read
imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then
most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want
allows us to connect with family in far away places and surf the internet for new information
the use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives
that brings satisfaction to my life
this is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many many different kinds of books
i turned out that their short cut was wrong
then their problem is solved
their families love turned the house into the home he loves
for example the earthquake in which
during peak hours there is a huge rush at the bus stops
time is mainly all we have
i maneuvered down the hill
after all the children are the future of our world
books are a great part of a students learning
since i go to my local high school i think its nice to be able to find anything i need in my library at school
another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from
in the essay the features of the setting affect the cyclist
personally i know at least poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease known as obesity
this means it has been there wars politics art and slavery
they also showed him the meaning of family
that changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills
no for live but for our life or something
the help each other whenever one is in need
it comforts me knowing everyone is happy
now is the time to turn of the computer and go outside
whether they are fiction or nonfiction
a third mood in the memoir is love
maybe a kid forgot his homework he can go to his school website and find it
i think the using the computer is not a bad benefit because it helps you be in communication with your family or friends
it is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and description of his life at home
these are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder
helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing
some book such as and are great to read for school assignments
computers are enjoyable great pieces of technology
in conclusion the society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us
the sections are split into children teens and adults
the book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home
in the there are all kinds of freedoms that we as use freely
a computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about days
not everything is decided by me
he feels that he is at home even though he moved to
parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read watch and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent
i do however agree with some censorship
not everyone gets offended by the same things or the same material
for example children should be taught that there really are bad people in the world
also helps kids like to find information for reports and
these books have meaning which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read
cell phones provide calling usage of course but they also allow you to text someone
recently you back to your six pack sexy self
in order for that person to ignore their personal issues they make fun of someone else
computers are making this happen
secondly you would spend less time with your family
dear i agree that computers had a positive effect on people
also they can do jobs and processes very quickly which is important in the workplace
the library should always have a large variety of different music
while you can be on the internet for about day to night and still pay the same price
it was a lovely evening
when i get home i check the homework and talk to my friends online
you can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again
the only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer
catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened
instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them
one of the of statements is of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want
business and commercial line is just the thing which i hate
so what are you waiting for get off that computer and take a hike
dear newspaper you know that two out of three own a computer
how can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs
alcohol is the same way
i honestly think that anything should be allowed in libraries
art is what makes people creative
it is the main reason why society is today predicting that this future generation is wobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation
by doing this they try and get it to be published and put in stores so people can buy it
this is why i agree that computers do benefit society
all of that set a very happy backdrop for the family
some passengers were polite and some were rude
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions
for a long happy life
third the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text
they share them with their neighbours
you can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go
his first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date
he had various points in support of his belief
because black people find it offensive
censorship can have good and bad qualities
plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world
in the final paragraph she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds
the internet does effect how you exercise
it would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended
the more your use your computer the faster you will trash it
not all people are the same and not all books or magazines are the same
it allows people to stay in touch learn about places and people and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news
computers not only help that but they are plentiful can be used in places such as libraries on internet cafe
my final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits
who knows it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around even longer if your in a city
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave
just like how they have an adult and children section
also if it absolutely needs to happen each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about
however people still think computers are good
stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come
i know people argue that computers should be used less but could you get through a week without using one computer
life is filled with mixed society and emotions so not everyone will agree on the same thing
i think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people
next computers allow easy access to the news and online textbooks
in the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life
to the this day in age computer technology rules the world
the love friendship shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph as well as the other ones too
seriously it only takes that long for a child to be introduced and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there
water clock and sand clock were invented to measure time
all of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist
now lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends
or just shows in general
love and sacrifice is the mood throughout the memoir that the author created
computers have played a vital role in creating our economy
firstly computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood
i think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up
memories promise and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph
the computer can also have an affect on family members and the time spent with them
also simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people
the book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life
also the lack of people and civilization affected the author
or say you see books you do not like on the shelve at
computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers
if all of those things are offensive to some people then they need a reality check
i was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend
the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”
computers do benefit society because they are fun a source of communication good for schooling and education and for work
she found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant
one of them was he hills the it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down
honestly in my eyes its simple if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it because others enjoy it
to bring magic in you include carrot onions garlic and plenty of leafy vegetables in your diet
second of all the computer network came up with new ideas for the computer
i have an that went to and is now in and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in
a nice sunny day sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books
these three features are what effects the cyclist the most
we could be improving obesity spending more time with family and friends and exploring nature
i never would have though it would have been that bad because of its rating
spending all day rolling away in front of a computer putting yourself and relationships in danger is unfortunately the effect of computers
if a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done
also there were hills
and it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends
when i was in sixth grade i was in a foster home that i hated
all of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then
the experience is not the same
you can your job and talk to the people you need to talk to
without a doubt computers are a very good thing
her friends and family refugees came to her house all the time
another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together
i personally have never had this kind of problem i have only been to the library around times i generally rent movies
removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge
being on the computer too much can harm your brain also
since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events
young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds
now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the
dear newspaper editor i am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of
another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the regime
have you ever wondered how libraries pick their books
on the other hand is a conservative
one day we will end up like the world in
i hope that you agree with computers having a great effect on people
these things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also
for example the villain is presented as an attractive character casual brave smart and successful with women
they would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her
he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him
all of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone
if people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it
so next time when you want to buy something that maybe to mature for children you might want to reconsider going to the library
my school library is a quiet place
someone could need to use a book that has something offensive in it but they would all be taken away to somewhere else
think about your interest in music art and the style of books or magazines that you read
why should it change now
this is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library
for starters the newspaper companies use computers to write the paper
i love to read and listen to all of them
also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it
buying and selling things on the computer is easier than it looks
but because it is a series should it be removed from shelves
dear times you think computers benefit society
this also includes email and blogs and some chat sites
if every book that was found offensive was taken of a shelf we would soon have no books left
so was wise in her observation
it would be incredibly rude to state that something is offensive to me might not be to someone else
it can lead to all three because those are the effects of being on a computer every of the day
several times in the story the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke
my views can vary when i am older and have children of my own someday
the mood the author created in the memoir is love
by everything i have said the mood throughout the memoir was happy kind caring and many moods similar to those
the library has over thousands of books and movies to choose from
nature is good smells good looks good and computers make people stay inside all day
he described his parents to be very caring and always put their children before their needs
you cannot only talk you can do business send pictures invitations and announcements
also he did know where he was go
my second reason why i think this is because when your having a party and you need invitations the computer can help you
this is why all different forms of books magazines radio and music could be offensive to people
it seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act such as music as the number one offensive material
obviously being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have
when changes happen with the hibiscus changes happen in the story
breathing in some fresh natural air can really calm a stressed child out
political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story
but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town
in the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with
the last movie that i did not like was all the movies
well at the easy access of internet on a computer you can buy all those items and more
when in the desert one must keep cool or perish
also you can put clothes and other store products an hold
technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life
also is another website that helps us study for vocab
the author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired
i personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent
thank you for your time
communication is extremely important in our society it brings families and friends closer together
the technology takes very important time away from children and adults
punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs
computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it
for older kids there are many games that can play
libraries should censor some of there material
many websites are designed for this reason
if libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present
i worked hard all night to get it done
some people feel that having particular material displayed on shelves of libraries is rather offensive to specific individuals
i personally think that is good for most kids
there are many beautiful flowers in our garden
first and for most is the fact that this is
she felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive
own experience with offensive books would be there are books that are made by
what do you do get on your computer
the cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town
they do not want to lose there books music movies magazines just because some people find the offensive
family is very important in the excerpt
i love them all very much
certain readings and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one
that is how it should go
the answer is the customers at the library
this lands them into trouble all the time
many people wanted it to be censored
unfortunately the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty
music is also one of the important thing that is carried in any school library or any public library
the mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood
computers can have their likes and dislikes
yet there are still others whose believes directly contradict these
if a has an explicit label on it you should have to be eighteen to check it out
this can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time
when she see this plant he childhood comes back and she forgets her test
programs that you can download make life a whole lot simpler and saves you a lot of time
the final paragraph talks about snow melting geese returning and the hibiscus budding
not even waste minutes on you phone
by using the computer people are not getting many benefits
he or she does not have much time for sleep and rest
he should love the younger students
why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in world is beyond me
to catch up with friends or to talk something with another
they save the world and be a hero by day but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well
so the mood created by the author was happy and grateful
computers are not the way to go
we spend most of our time with our family and friends so we want a little bit of time to ourselves
they are because they get start a new life over
if it is a major issue that highly offends many people it should not be in a public library
the brain is like a because you can store information and nobody can hack into it
people who pollute waterways should be punished severely
the used it in the colonies during the to keep the colonists loyal to the crown
everyone just pushes and jostles
then we will move onto the music and then the shows
because of it he misses at least day of school a week
people should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy
everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies
one reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better
if there is an who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library
they had to leave their country their friends and family and they had to pretty much start their lives over again
it expands peoples interactive life helping them make new friends
it is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world
if no one can read the books no one learns
i think it does and hope that you agree with me
the computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so i advice you get one
dear local newspaper people throughout the world use or own computers
in some movies for example the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or language
statistics show that you can find more information on a computer than a book
this makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved
computers are horrible when it comes to this topic
it is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information
this is why people should agree that advance in technology
that also shows how grateful the author is because it says how he is gracious for his neighborhood and the many things he learned
freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country
does your neighborhood seem to be locking children
remember its your own opinion about the book not everyone is different then you
we as people have the right to learn read and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us
other games are also addicting too
the person has the right to watch or read what i have
we can also learn about nature from our home
when the child reads this he might want to do everything that is in the book
as a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom a library is a wonderful resource
in conclusion computers do have a positive effect on people
so if you do go on the computer not for almost half the day
she is grateful for all that her parents sacrificed to give her a better life
also she did a nice job because throughout the story i could feel her pain
not only that but they also have exercise plans
what to do now let you on the computer again
their are good and bad books but that all depends on the opinion of the reader
cousins and i rarely see one another but computers make it possible for us to stay connected
everyone has an opinion and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing
the author of this memoir created many moods
like hitting a baseball
many parents have different standards and what some parents find acceptable for their children appall others
this online predator smoothly invited her to the mall where they moved
over ninety four percent of people today own a computer ad feel as though they have learned many things from it
dear more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
censorship helps prevent people from viewing listening or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups
i have to disagree with the supporters of technology
well that was another opinion of mine so read on to see what else i got
for example a really offensive show called is a really offensive and people just see it as entertaining
children need to be careful about they say or show on the internet
like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer
well in my opinion i think that computers help out so much more than a book
good and bad things come from this
people can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals
the cyclist continues on despite being very dehydrated
some people find some offensive subjects interesting
if you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences then do not put it on a public display
also many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there
my mom always says that that is how she stays close to her friends and that is the same with me
it might not be good for the eyes of people
say yes to computers good effect
i think we should have more time outside
the building was abandoned
as you can see the computer has a lot of positives
we also took along bats balls and other games
some good ways to spend time with your family is to play games together go on a walk or even go to a bike ride together
going to like school libraries for books i think it really depends on the age group
most people do not know this but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes which is bad
his main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat
also if you had nobody to talk to one time you go on the computer and try to meet new people
computers are great for
for example want to go ride bikes
you can get headaches from just staring at the screen for to long
this awkwardness can also ruin previously close friendships
most people like myself do not agree with this idea
he was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave
books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be a age to where you can get it
the memory still haunts me
i know that out of people love to travel but you need plane tickets
at her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories
dear newspaper the years the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising and enjoying nature
she knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better
dear you know computers are a major part of our society
of kids like to read
i hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live
on the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places nature and even people
there is only people who are not yet ready for the they are about to obtain
i think computers help people out because you can learn about at here thing like you want a job you can look it up in the computers
its a positive ending
you might be upset and find it unfair because you cannot do some things
also sometimes its a little dangerous to put your last name
studies show out of people who use a computer do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world nations are becoming more over weight
there is such a thing as which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer
well some libraries want to take that concept away
in the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win
this at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time
new technology and post pictures on websites where everyone can see
this shows that computers are important to students and are used their benefit
also computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome
the ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out
this making it dangerous
a bad neighbor makes a hell of our lives
another example would be slavery
although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication
music can tell you the life of people by poetry
i always thought how the human body works is incredible
she has set a goal to accept it
his route was deserted so nobody could help him
this showed the warmth love and selflessness of the family
the library is open to anybody that wishes to enter
i believe in not allowing censorship in libraries
my brother is still too young to go to school
after the second page my hands hurt very badly not only was i completing my essay i was also exercising my hands
they will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book
she is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home
the sun was beginning to beat down
second you do projects or homework
family and friends and even mental health
this could make some satisfying results
in order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all
the mood created by the author in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness
teens got to talk to each other make new friends and post what they want
for i play music and talk to my friends at the same time
this really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling
people go to the library for a lot of reason computers books etc
they have a nice home nice friends and a good and caring family
we enjoy each season with its fruits festivals and weather
that means your going to have to not let it get under you skin or get over it
it holds tons of great information
also you cant give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job
there are too many magazines that try and expose women
all around the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it
that was the way of life for them and the author was simply trying to show that to the reader
no i think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it
my second reason for being is that it can help teach said and life skills
my father had carried sweets
but once you find it you would need to check the copyright
the media does not look at you as a whole just as a population of people
of people in the world use computers one time in their lives
one feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain
first when on the computer people have less time to exercise
when i was little my grandma would take me to the library almost every
my teacher gives us homework every we have to do are facts about anything you want to write about
shes going to retake it and try again
the mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning
those of the various moods set by the author in this memoir
in conclusion this is how the setting affected the cyclist
they sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves
many people not agree but i just tried to make people to see my point of this statement
this is what i think the authors mood is in the memoir
i feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion
if parents can change they way they raise there children i think the world would be a better place
so you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us
or the big dragon came from
even in school systems librarians are there to guide kids to read good books
the only problem with this the ease at which this type of information can be gotten
they also have small teeth inside the mouth
books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others
the author loves everything about this neighborhood
think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves
i believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire
in the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke
if they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them what would be left to read
music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics
but there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others
have you ever been one of those students who write their papers but get bad grades because their handwriting was messy
most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis
also he had to keep dehydrate
usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it
so she wont now other
in conclusion sections in a library can be used instead of censorship
our children are the most important things to us
they steal the user away from the outside word
for those reasons materials should not be removed
i hope that you can how see how great computer are and how much they help our present day citizens
you can not always make everyone happy
although many disagree with the use of computers there hand eye communications and learning purposes are very important
another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes
when he stops for water the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops
the banning of books is a banning of freedom
lastly computers give us the chance to express our ideas like never before
can be harmless but it can also be offensive
to of children who use the internet are most likely so succeed in college because they know what websites to go to and how to get there
so should books in a library be censored
in conclusion all i say is that without computers in this world
there is however one other element at play here protection of youth and innocence
the three main moods where grateful loving and happy
everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too
furthermore many colleges offer their courses online
when we go to visit our friends and relatives we collect different plants from their garden also
dear local newspaper i believe that people should stay with computers
in the evening i go to play with my friends
that is we could meet people from lots of other countries when participating in international sports activities
without this type of setting the story would have completely changed
one person could think the material is offensive but someone else might want to learn more about it
go their and hangout with friends interact with them
one more reason she have used this is that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it
the road changed into rolling hills
it just goes to show no ones opinion is right or wrong
time parents told me we were going to for the day
second here are some dark secret of the computer
he was now fearing a heat stroke
it would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not
who wins the people who find then offensive or the people who enjoy them
next i feel that if your constantly on the computer then your parents will have an extremely high light bill
if certain items become restricted it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them
what will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned
for example in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious
she takes us to school and brings back from the school
the author takes paragraphs and to fully explain his gratitude to his parents
some people learn more about people from books
nature is very important and can be extremely fun so this is a shame
that would lead to hundred of kids with on obesity problem
many people are too focused on the internet and they lack on their normal activities
she is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her
this indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today
someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created and range from pointless to addicting from tiny to massive
so next time your on the computer think about that
overall society needs computers and they have and overwhelming positive affect on society
this is saying that there was a fun vibe in his house when he was growing up which makes you feel happy
in my own experience from reading the book i would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to
that is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with
now i hope you see why computers are a good part of all of our lives
i disagree with that statement
the dangers of online interaction and the risk of having your information stolen
i think everything should be there
most authors write about things such as sex drugs and other bad thing
furthermore they allow you to expand your knowledge
besides the telephone computers do have some bad things about them too
so to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion no matter if it is offensive or not
they can have music movies magazines books and much more
this like totally needs to stop before everyone is addicted to spreading rumors
like how these people got there dream home and this was it
familiar with is a great program for socializing but there are many stronger dangers
plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing
you would get addicted to being on the computer all the time
it also sometimes goes by what you are looking for
when on the computer kids will eat
she is entitled to them
every one in the universe finds certain things offensive
who cares if someone is black or white
i do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people
she cried to show her pain and bought a plant to cheer her up
when you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot you should really just visit that place
also for questions you can go to one of the websites an you ask the question and many other people might answer the question your looking for
many people love different types of books no matter if they are offensive or not others like them
i asked each of the kids how long it took them
computers are good for school uses skills and just for fun
that out of member of family learn thing from the computer
taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives
a computer offers no face to face interaction
you have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library
i subscribe to magazines and read books on these subjects
there will always be many more books there to look at
they based their lives on family and happiness inside their home
to ignore leaves you in fear
although this is true i believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries
what you can even do is you can talk to your friends listen to music and do homework
his work is full of difficulties
it will briefly tell you that there is some content they not be appropriate that hurt feelings and simply offend
all this show that where was he born how he got her and him getting a better life
a rainbow is an arch or a bow of seven colours that
the main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note
going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone anywhere type anything needed or to use the internet
where no one is able to get things out
in my language arts class we have a reading blog that every student has to participate in
first i feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive
these people are so smart they figured out a way to have school online
computers help everyone
that’s why we consider them as a visible god
i guess he is just very grateful for his parents his childhood everything and everyone he has ever met had or done in his life
he has one son and one daughter
understanding that there are young fragile children that are privy to all forms all public entertainment some censorship be required
computers have flaws but they also have so positive effects too that i think they shine over all the tiny flaws
humans use computers mainly because it makes life simpler easier
without computer my mom would have more in other countries
she felt a sense of security in conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start
she gave me a for a project grade
we reached there in the afternoon and it was very cold
there are millions of sites containing such content
some people be against censorship in libraries but there often is not censorship in bookstores movie stores music libraries etc
do you still think this has a positive effect on people
the author is trying to get his point out
third reason every could be offense to somebody
features of the setting could affect the cyclist
airports make for the government and internet less people would travel
the internet is where most of this takes place though
the reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come
depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provides the thing you want
it provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends family
the mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration
computers not only help people in school but at home too
like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil or something
is there a place out there that you really want to know more about that you hope to someday visit
going outside is better for you to
also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in
how would you feel if you went another country and knew nothing about it
well it is because has a big role in our lives
this made me smile it was so beautiful
this is a question that both sides can argue with creditable facts
it signaled to me that they all must be happy together
people need to start spending more time on exercising and less time on their computer due to the facts that more and more states obese percents just keep rising
i remember my older sister had to do some research on the computer gave her all of the information she needed
i once read a book that i found in our school library that was about slavery
benefits that game help
there are ratings on movies and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly
these computers help with everyday life
with this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework
the ticket came up to
then there is email which can send letters photos and comments
everyone has a right to read what they want to read
imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay
people have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books magazines etc
most importantly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people
this is about billion hours of computer usage around the world
was one of the top picked books by high school students
this means that even though there was segregation around them their neighborhood was still friendly
it is the season of flowers and fruits
next he describes his neighborhood
all that we have to do is take away the computer
there is all different kinds of stuff in there
i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options
talk to people and see what they like
the author recreates his welcoming warm musical home for the reader to visit and enjoy
any way children become more social
the snow melting the geese returning and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings
dear local newspaper i agree with the experts when they say people are spending too much time on the computers
would we still be today
i say this because when you have an addiction to anything it is hard to stop
the mood created by the author was grateful and happy
computer screens are harmful to the eyes if you stare at one for too long
being outside they can play sports ride bikes swim run and more
they have lots of ways to video chat message and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with
at a campground in the setting is calming and relaxing
dear newspaper are you aware that more than of families have ownership to a computer
the setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there
reading material can help a young person with life
things like this still go on and the rate at which they happen are in creasing
she concludes the story by writing when they come back the geese then i will take that test
when you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late
be like me and get rid of your computer
who knows maybe at this time in years will be run by computer
in the future we are going to see more and more computers
says about the internet site
most children are addicted to computer games
like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs
she would spend days on end on the computer
i know i if i were to ever have children i would want them around something they understand and know nothing bad and harmful
if you find a book or anything like that hard to deal with it is crazy
the computer is one of the top uses by but i think we spend a little to much time on it
libraries are made for the community and the people in it not just one person
the sea is full of many forms of life minerals and salts
offensive things have been around in libraries probably since the first library opened
when using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright lights
but computers can teach you so much more than just different countries
this quote also shows a loving mood as well
every library has tons of information on just about everything
we packed our luggage and hired an autorickshaw
i think at least of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising
by removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed
people and much more
sometimes teachers give assignments out and you have to write an essay
then everybody starts saying the foul language
and finally you can play many many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination
however the novels that i have read are not always novels i have chosen for my personal gain
in my opinion i say that computers do have and effect on us but a good reason
the best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away
for instance my friends all have the infamous
teens learn to type to make life easier
should books music movies and magazines that are offensive to public be removed
if the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read
aunt rosi gave it to me as a present
this is along the lines of personal thought
also you learn to be nice on computers
you can even shop for houses or cars online
i feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer
another example i could use is my mom she talks to her family in and in other places too
my second reason is that people go to inappropriate sites and watch inappropriate videos
but when in not doing my school work talking to my friends online
by censoring rape from media we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape
yea they have their plus and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous
some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though
the only time that this cyclist found water was when it and tasting of battery acid
so all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf
movies always have ratings so staff could put anything rated or above on those shelves
if a person wants to buy their own music artists are required to make two of the same album one with censors and one without
school family and sports is my always tells me
a few things that i would find that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs nudity horrible violence and bullying
another one would be that you could learn about another states and countries around the world
he is fourteen years old
hand eye coordination is very important
word is not acceptable today and therefore people take offense to his work
sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody live that close
it set this mood because he can have a nice and happy life
that is the same with magazines books and anything available at a library
well the can solve both of those problems and more
it gives us joy in our spare time
i have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do bad things no
in a library you have the right to have an open mind
if that was someone you loved
the computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool
there would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out
the rest of the building is a scattering of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre
in this addiction many people can lose time with their family time to exercise and enjoy nature
we need to the of social without computer
many people use computers for different reason
censorship should be allowed to an extent
some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short rolling hills
take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run
so if you are ever wondering weather or not to buy a computer i suggest you get one
this part of his journey affects him the most
they also help us connect with no another and help us excel in school
seeing all my aunts uncles and cousins it so much better and fun
why would something that yes is offensive to some but would grab promote and keep some within it
history is around to be studied even if the topics might be offensive to some people
finally they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship
for my first reason computers have so many technology things inside that help people everyday
to continue have you ever found yourself asking your kids on how to work the computer
men women and children were hurrying home
i have read many different things in my lifetime so far
so click your mouse on internet explorer and get your email
i only get to see him because a lot of money to come
everyone goes on the computer
get new friends from anywhere in the world
they are situated throughout the library for children adults and teens
this can take up to on how
some people think computers are the lives of many people but i have to disagree with those who say that
instantly when opening the door i hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall in the adult section
you can even fill out a job application right then and there
explaining how his family loves cooking and playing music
she wants to retake the test
the setting in the story discouraged the biker very much
she became familiar with her surroundings
the setting affected the cyclist mood in the story
dear local newspaper people think that computers educate people for the future but i think that they actually harm children and adults as well
dear newspaper computers are not something to be afraid of
the are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world
there is only one choice and that is that computers effect all of us in a good way
everyone has a different view on things
the mood is portrayed as happy and thankful about the lessons his parents taught
taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive
why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house
the communists censored everything inside the
people are very easily distracted on computers it wastes time and it causes stress
his children are good natured and have good manners
such as a homework question or just to talk for fun
it is their right to do so
if there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it
lastly you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people
since i was the youngest i was also the shortest
oliver is a good athlete too
the features affected is abilities because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle
you can chat with people typing
another thing is computers give kids a positive ego or entertainment
online you can learn about the history of specific places
music is something that mostly everyone listens to
the author creates a loving and caring mood
many people have been talking about computers in the
this idea relates to my first idea but i will speak some of it again
i am the kid that has no choice in the matter
we need to show them that we know what they doing
as a society we are becoming too dependent on technology supervisor says
in conclusion we should limit our computer time to do other tasks be active and spend time with friends and family
there are fore my parents love him very much
now think about it the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad alone or leaved out
he was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat
we will always be in contact with the ones we love
i say this is because of the censorship in libraries
two years ago there was a boy named
libraries are considered public places and have a wide range of audiences
quite often by the time their turn come it is time for closing
researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer
what if you would like to buy a plane ticket to to help
all of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take
a young girl showed her shooting skills
and for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things i learned there about how to love
i went on the internet typed in my question about reading and two seconds later thousands of results up
the mood is thankful because is appreciating all that his parents have done for him
think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of other
i hope what i have just explained now helps me make my
finally the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer
to take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task
years ago people were able to function fine with out computers so we should be able to too
since i use the computer everyday onto all
my parents gifted me a red bicycle and arranged a big party for me
who would decide what is offensive and not offensive
it would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity
after the third day of reading this book we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book
notice that have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended
personally i believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries
another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature
libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you
the libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music
dear people at my school sit on there computers after school
his cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in
examinations cannot thus be removed
a there ever a time where there a movie that you wanted to see but due to graphics in the movie you were not aloud to see it
if someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive then they should not watch that movie or read that book
if the snake would have bitten him he could have died from poison
like stop going outside and getting fresh air
those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends
every school is different
once she realized that she needed to deal with change she knew that she would need to try the driving test again
the biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die
in other words why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch
and there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water
the environment we grow up in is how we turn out and being read about or heard is not the way to be
he loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home
we all have are opinions
for example my brother plays on the computer everyday so barely goes outside
that was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration
the features of the setting effected the cyclist very much
lastly i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice
when being on computer for a long time people will forget how to interact with others
mainly they seem very helpful but others can have different opinions
lots of critics say that a computer is not educational
the libraries really need to just stop and think for a second is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment
computers are good for if you need to find information about anything
the mood created in this article is a joyful mood
there was no water either
computers have made information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is
the computer made for storing information and learning
and it is wrong and inhuman
so why would you remove valuable information
according to a recent study of citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet
in my opinion there should be very censorship in a library
you need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out
computers are amazing and society benefits from them by a lot
so next time you hear some one wanting something removed tall them this or next time you want some thing removed you refer back to this
but it also allows us to communicate with the people online
they allow us to learn about faraway places communicate with others and inspire the world around us with our ideas
she knows that she will pass the test
you can google anything you want from when the ended to when the collapsed in
it gives the mind something positive to hold on to
the setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water

the parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying
experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is tacking away time from you being able to interacting with family members and friends
i never could type but i caught on because if you are having fun while you it will be easy to turn
on the other hand the computer does have cons
if we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed
the author says that his parents helped him discover the real meaning of family
yes people do spend that time in computers a lot its because computers are very helpful in many ways
i use computers a lot
maybe go to the mall with friends and
computer help society learn about all this
i had studied the whole day
if a piece of is particularly offensive the piece should not be displayed
the fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips
whatever the reasoning should be censorship is wrong
racism abortion abuse unwinding your children what ever the case be some people will support and some will not
it talks about how they will never forget the memories and how generous their parents where
computers can also be very dangerous

libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of
computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town
these are the reasons why i think that they are not spending to much times on the computers
there are only a few that i named but every age group has a specific spot at the library
if i look in the library i could find a book with offensive material but the book could still be a very good book
i believe that computers effect most people negatively
because it can be hurtful dirty for younger kids and it could be prevented if they are removed from shelves
not only that but you should notice the great potential the computer has for showing us distant faraway lands and cultures
some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite instead of taking the time to go outside
she is going to overcome the problem
as soon as the recess bell goes the calm of the school is broken
he learned with his family how to love others and how to respect
the next thing that i think should be censured at the library is magazines
finally the cyclist reaches a small bait shop and all hope is returned as he drank deeply from the sink
now that you have heard all of reasons for why computers are helpful in society i should rap things up
he is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive
we use that to talk to our friend and family
how many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries
this is because engines such as have of limits to with much information on the topic being
there was no water to be found and the terrain is were rough and bumpy
the uses radar to see if there is any boats or submarines coming near them and the have a heads up if there would be an attack
in the essay rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey
there are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf but here are a couple of mine
thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression
when watching a movie with a sad ending most people cry
so next spring she wants to make her mom happy pass cause she will be ready
it would be great if some how the system could be improved and people need to be more responsible
so if you need to find a job then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you
the great thing about you is you can find the information fast and easy
and this will make them get more weight
but mainly the mood is loving
it gives me the feeling that i could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger
how would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries
clearly computers make it easier to talk to people
for example the other day i logged onto the internet and saw an article about the earthquake in
but why should your values and beliefs dictate what another person can or cannot get from their library
as humans we are given certain freedoms and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press
if you have a question about the use

the hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her but at the same time s very comforting
literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion
therefore it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive

for example in the story when he enters the fork in the road it says he found several rusty pumps and one ramshackle shed
computers are all needed just for those reasons
why do people go to libraries
well you never see them because they live far away right
you can learn things on them or play games
lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world
dear local newspaper experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while
if you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives
but more importantly this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading watching or listening to
censorship has taken a turn in public libraries but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries
now do i think the the novel should be banned from a library
so i think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into it each day
if we take peoples choice away what are they going to have
it is important to know about the possible outcome and dangers before we say or do something

the people would not be the only thing out of hand
this might cause his emotion break down to make his energy to loss
