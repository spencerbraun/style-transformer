the last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination <pad>
i interact with my friends <percent> of us population between the ages <num> have a <caps> <pad>
letting them grow up as innocent as possible <pad>
there i was so mad i could have killed <pad>
when people get computers they spend more time inside and on them <pad>
<caps> like these in my head <pad>
i guess all that waiting really payed off <pad>
<person> was blessed that he had his house <pad>
if we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs things will get out of control <pad>
the dirigibles would constantly be moving and shifting <pad>
a chorus of laughter filled the air <pad>
another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself <pad>
only to quickly realize that it was only her fist <pad>
the empire state building was already standing in the architects decided to and make a dock for dirigibles <pad>
an author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders <pad>
i think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times <person> had in his house <pad>
she said i cant have one till <num> grade unless i get a <caps> phone write now and cant till grade to get a real phone
they just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie <pad>
spending time with family is way more important then going on the computer with friends <pad>
the human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology <pad>
most importantly they are a vital source of communication <pad>
because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things thats the book does <pad>
hes also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old mens directions <pad>
you can get help in school work also <pad>
the obstacles the builders faced were too many and this project soon became impossible to finish and it never was <pad>
thats why the computer <pad>
another one is the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation <pad>
the very computer you <month> love can harm you <pad>
this made the trip extra hard and <pad>
they get all up inside for the whole day <pad>
i believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials <pad>
in my opinion that was patience <pad>
the <caps> has many fun websites such as <caps> <pad>
the obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles <pad>
overall the project was just doomed to fail from the start <pad>
so yea the last sentence he said i liked it <pad>
i feel that books should stay on the shelf however <pad>
i will talk about why i disagree with this statement <pad>
the mood the author set was warmth and happiness <pad>
thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say <pad>
and finally we were in <location> <pad>
the computer is very smart and is probably the best technology invented <pad>
so i get back in the driver seat and we are all yelling get in the car but she laughing really hard saying i wet my pants
there are some that need to be clean up <pad>
i remember it like if it was just last week <pad>
he kept saying i know he is in there <pad>
immediately <person> ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we <caps> we got home that night
they could play a variety of games <pad>
censorship in libraries has become an debate <pad>
in making this huge building there were many obstacles <pad>
i remember that morning i felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time <pad>
<caps> me fun was doing stuff i normally would not do <pad>
right away i start to laugh <pad>
another reason the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful is that the author understands his parents hardships <pad>
in the story construction workers faced a problem <pad>
it <month> be the readers <pad>
they all ate lunch at the school and got pizza or sub sandwiches <pad>
this made it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building <pad>
a third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people <pad>
that is why this idea was and unsafe <pad>
i say that because people look at magazines that have shooting in then and that have crime in them to <pad>
reading books could give people more things to talk about <pad>
i believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope <pad>
another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation <pad>
after a we all had swam around for a bit we decided to go of the rope swing <pad>
i was that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age <pad>
patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant <pad>
mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles <pad>
magazines are good for a couple of different nice things <pad>
this is not what i want to happen though <pad>
laughter can create this type of bond thats hard to <pad>
there are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing <pad>
you wont go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday <pad>
it was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a active older couple <pad>
there is always a choice of what to do and what not to do <pad>
also the computer can save of important things you need <pad>
he laughed so hard his eyes started to water <pad>
<caps> they came down the hallway i could hear there foot step <pad>
he was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal <pad>
a lot of times you could be watching <caps> <pad>
there are many great effects computers have on and for people <pad>
movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older <pad>
patients is a sort of a gift <pad>
i think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades <pad>
i loved those they were blue my favorite color <pad>
the first reason being what maybe offensive to you <month> not be to someone else <pad>
when somethings really funny i usually have a hard time to get another of air because i cant stop laughing <pad>
if i was a in a <organization> i would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express
i have been patient many times in days <pad>
<caps> i cant either <pad>
when we finally got there my <caps> made me wait and <pad>
another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything <pad>
because once they are gone then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because of the books that they find interesting are gone <pad>
i was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first <pad>
computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework <pad>
he called it a substance it had a flavor of battery acid <pad>
the builders had to go through many obstacles to <caps> to allow the dirigible to dock on the <organization> <pad>
if the person spoke in <caps> and <caps> than he or she could teach you <pad>
there are some material that a adult <month> need to help in life <pad>
it would be all the more reason for him to give up <pad>
another reason is that it was just not safe to dock these massive blimps that high <pad>
he was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him <pad>
<caps> is the key to their future <pad>
attempted screams came out as moans <pad>
we will not learn the new ideas that authors put out there for us if people just keep getting offended and taking them off the shelves
missed the first bus the caught the next one <pad>
and that was the time i was patient <pad>
i told her that some guys asked me if we have cars in <location> <pad>
<caps> to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest <pad>
<caps> makes any task difficult because the sun drains a persons energy <pad>
there was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal <pad>
that way you could finish your story in time <pad>
laughter for me is what starts a friendship if i can make someone laugh we are already closer then when we first said <caps> <pad>
another example is when it says tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me <pad>
<caps> responded with patience and years of practice <pad>
some people <month> like the content it shows <pad>
the last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas <pad>
i love my little sister <caps> <pad>
well hope you like the way i put the words in my story so by and see you next time <pad>
this was the first obstacle which affected him <pad>
computers give you all that <pad>
<caps> my uncle <person> said <pad>
the wind coming off of other building would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed <pad>
i finally said i love you girl <pad>
i have used patience many times <pad>
i tell myself what am i forgetting <pad>
the last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law <pad>
i was controlling the big boat the only boat with a motor <person> behind us was the canoe <pad>
ill give you <num> reasons <pad>
said <person> our health teacher <pad>
this is how to use mood correctly <pad>
we could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers <pad>
if a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them <pad>
either its a law or the parents have made it a rule <pad>
are offensive then you really got to take action <pad>
we were told it was irresponsible and <pad>
the builders of the empire state building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there <pad>
so the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him <pad>
the second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect <pad>
all i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it
we had become friends <pad>
sometimes we she take a break from them and enjoy nature <pad>
with others made of helium <pad>
everybody has a different way of what keeps them close to a friend so i think its different for everybody <pad>
when i have children i will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them <pad>
no i disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day that people use <pad>
my grandpa ever so kindly offered to go pick her up but then i mentioned that <caps> and i could go do it <pad>
i believe that computers benefit society <pad>
we both thought that <person> and <person> were never hanging out with us <pad>
for all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job <pad>
the author uses words such as warm to describe things <pad>
i do not believe computers benefit society <pad>
thats the way id be getting when ever id get bothered at him <pad>
so these were <caps> reasons or some bad effects computers could have on people if your not go outside to do some activities or to hang out with some friends
my mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister <pad>
let them find out about stuff when they ask a question <pad>
in the tent that <time> we were so tired everything seemed funny to us <pad>
she feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test <pad>
i stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by <caps> <pad>
these laughing experiences have turned our relationship into a friend relationship <pad>
he setting made the cyclist feel lonely <pad>
the only slight bit of worry for trouble was one of the friends became behind on his task of finding hotels and places to stay for everyone <pad>
a time when i was patient is when i was at food store waiting for my food <pad>
in conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future <pad>
the author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown <pad>
the door as <person> began to place the tip of his <caps> onto the colored carpet in his parents bedroom <pad>
the builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the empire state building <pad>
one reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues <pad>
this showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat <pad>
that is so important because a computer could do a lot <pad>
magazines are not really a problem <pad>
another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas <pad>
being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration <pad>
in <caps> i had to stand in front of the class to give <caps> conclusion <pad>
were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity <pad>
you wont be patient with your boss when you get a job <pad>
<person> rolled her eyes and re gripped her pillow and blankets <pad>
fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw <person> riding in the back of someones old <organization> truck
the builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast <pad>
we got settled into ground blind at about <num> <pad>
that is why the author concludes that statement <pad>
i <caps> the culture and how you need to appreciate what you have <pad>
they would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about <person> <pad>
i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where the many things i learned there about how to love <pad>
this was an example of how it helped me and my best friend become friends and stay friends through everything life has thrown at us <pad>
she said and that was the <date> thing she said to me until we reached our destination <pad>
nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read <pad>
though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages <pad>
workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment <pad>
the designers had such big plans for the building that reality was far off <pad>
at the bottom was <caps> <pad>
i laughed thinking how did i not know that <pad>
that <time> was a hoot <pad>
why bore yourself to death with computers that will probably give you the wrong advise when you could always ask a friend for advise <pad>
too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday <pad>
computers give people a place to interact with others <pad>
that is why i think that computers help develop a smarter brain <pad>
i explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details <pad>
the last main obstacle of the empire state buildings builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas <pad>
then we took turns and watching the big open road <pad>
our <caps> grade teacher had lots of in her class room and one of her was a tree named <caps> <pad>
another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying its safety <pad>
also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored <pad>
my first reaction was to use my nervous laugh <pad>
she will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted <pad>
studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well <pad>
<person> hand shot straight up in the air <pad>
the computer has helped us first make a model of our invention then we start making the details <pad>
the went over us and the <organization> was going <pad>
<num> out of <percent> of kids agree with <caps> science teacher <person> <pad>
an hour past by it was still raining <pad>
i think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves <pad>
we learned this in paragraph <num> when the author states a thousandfoot dirigible moored at the top of the building <pad>
another way <caps> shows <caps> is grateful is <caps> says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home <pad>
i think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read <pad>
but not everyone agrees that this benefit society <pad>
life in itself can be an opinion <pad>
i learned this during a visit to the dentists office <pad>
it was the <date> and we lived just around the corner <pad>
there was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area <pad>
its not using time wisely <pad>
she was sad <caps> weeks had passed and <caps> was the beginning of a new school year <pad>
<caps> <organization> <caps> before <caps> said her name <pad>
it will not be safe for the pedestrians below the empire state building <pad>
banning books would go against what our country stands for <pad>
they <month> use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages <pad>
also computers can save you time and money now <pad>
so thats when we went to my moms room and used the and put the hose all the way out the back door <pad>
so my mom got home drove me and we ended up a hour and a half late but my <caps> was still very patient <pad>
it is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone <pad>
it was a very good statement <pad>
one time my volleyball team went to <organization> <pad>
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
i believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work <pad>
she said it was <caps> <pad>
she was patient because every single time i asked for something she got it without complaining she just did what i asked her to do <pad>
we both are very fun and people <pad>
they can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life <pad>
thinking to my self i hurried to get my clothes packed for the week <pad>
lastly kids can learn about people from other times <pad>
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships lying too low over urban areas <pad>
if a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material <pad>
there are just to many people in this world and i have read articles about libraries <pad>
we have so many fun memories together <pad>
censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the <location> <pad>
secondly i think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states <pad>
i think they should be able to keep them <pad>
thats why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the empire state building <pad>
these are important things that help me keep up with things away from my town <pad>
all the facts of life and the world are put into it <pad>
the owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area <pad>
thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials <pad>
they let us talk to friends and family around the world <pad>
my mom said that shed be wide back <pad>
there are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong <pad>
i guess i never believed laughter is the shortest distance between two people <pad>
in paragraph <num> it says the winds on top of the building were constantly moving <pad>
he knows it was hard for his parents to leave their country for him <pad>
you have three people on the roof of <organization> out the road and you have four <caps> <pad>
<caps> i looked at her like <caps> was crazy <pad>
recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination the more enjoyable it is <pad>
also another obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around <pad>
it was <num> and my is <num> so i had to hurry up <pad>
my father i have yet to see <pad>
i believe laughter is an important part of any relationship <pad>
there are some people out there that believe that if any material anything bad then it should be removed <pad>
so i say we as in the <location> citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of
<date> i went to bed i asked once more and again she said no <pad>
one of these obstacles was the mooring mast itself <pad>
when we stopped there i got inside a shopping basket and my friends and i were racing down the and maid all the other laugh
this can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away <pad>
another obstacle the architects had to work with was putting the mooring mast up on the building <pad>
i was walking into the room where the speech competition was <pad>
a religion a person might be it might offend you <pad>
winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and it <pad>
the author creates a special mood in this memoir <pad>
exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit <pad>
we sat there drank coffee and ate <pad>
all you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you <pad>
that is just another example why the computer has a positive effect <pad>
many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend <pad>
you can see where its going just by looking at the screen <pad>
instead of a patience <pad>
patients is about many things <pad>
i would not want my <num> year old kid read a book with bad language in it <pad>
he could have died from heat stroke and lack of water <pad>
you might even find a lady bug <pad>
i believe people should not be able to censor books <pad>
some people just have to deal with these people <pad>
it <caps> simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting <pad>
spring is when the snows melt and geese return <pad>
eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief <pad>
were part of a movement that will last forever <pad>
everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like <pad>
i helped other people <pad>
it helps the police and <caps> <pad>
the girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes <pad>
this shows how he loved his home <pad>
the feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist <pad>
you can sign up for jobs right on your computer <pad>
its not the writers fault <pad>
it would cause a conflict of two different sides <pad>
she talks about how her parents helped others of their kind which made her what she is today <pad>
i and headed down the hall to them <pad>
<num> problems on each side <pad>
the computer is great if you have to do research <pad>
so if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside <pad>
they help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done <pad>
most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents <pad>
all of these reasons contributed to why docking dirigibles would come with many obstacles <pad>
the reason is that benefits society <pad>
this once again made me feel sad and depressed <pad>
a huge of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas <pad>
the answer is patience <pad>
two more things affected the cyclist <pad>
the picture came out <pad>
she mentions that her parents raised her well and they made it seem like they were a extremely great family <pad>
i was supposed to be one of the first people out of my group of friends who was going to get there permit <pad>
and then we have no book left on the self for any of us <pad>
you can make a difference in the way people feel about computers <pad>
i think this <caps> is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was <pad>
another obstacle was nature <pad>
as <caps> all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another <pad>
libraries have books and magazines that is for children and also for adults and even grandparents <pad>
in conclusion there are many people that <month> or <month> not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion
so when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out <pad>
this climate the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert <pad>
for a long time it was hope you will read <pad>
for the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre <pad>
i think the memoir has a happy and grateful mood <pad>
computers teach handeye coordination and they let you communicate with other people <pad>
there immune system making the risk of getting sick greater <pad>
using computers has been very helpful to our society <pad>
things that are offensive range from all the way to extreme violence <pad>
finally in the last paragraph the very last sentence says i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home <pad>
instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions <pad>
but their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff <pad>
another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides too you <pad>
we were outside this talking to each other <pad>
it is how others think about what is out there in these libraries not what you think <pad>
it was hard enough for the builders to build the empire state building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top
it is alright to not agree with another person says but everyone does have the right to stand up and say what they think about the situation
the <caps> had to modify and strengthen the building to accommodate the new situation <pad>
that is how laughter brought <person> and i to be best <caps> <pad>
but a child laughs <caps> you make a funny face or <caps> an animal does something funny <pad>
i have a few reasons also <caps> i think there should not be censorship in libraries <pad>
the greatest reason the mooring mast of the empire state building never fulfilled its purpose was because of safety issues <pad>
is a moment that is remember by many people <pad>
the <caps> of the <location> <caps> <location> that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press <pad>
were all born with the ability to laugh <pad>
<caps> let out a and moved his kings knights up two squares and hit the clock <pad>
besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that never got considered or addressed <pad>
like at <time> i saw my cousin and she gave me <money> for my birthday <pad>
once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting <pad>
removing the material might and offend the author or other readers <pad>
now thats just my opinion <pad>
another situation was working at <location> this <date> <pad>
the first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert <pad>
some talk about nonfiction and some fiction <pad>
i woke up just like any other day happy yet lacking sleep <pad>
its so hard not to feel better when laughing <pad>
if someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others <pad>
next it was time to gear up and put my on <pad>
now its a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water <pad>
we rely on such things <num> to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught <pad>
i have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than i could have ever done <pad>
with his parents giving up everything from their past just to start a family with a better life <pad>
the purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource <pad>
people should use a <caps> more often <pad>
in this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time <pad>
this means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the governments or the citizens opinions <pad>
so who am i to tell another person what they can and can not do <pad>
this is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places <pad>
yet some people refuse to accept computers are now apart of every day life <pad>
computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle <pad>
books that are bad should be taken off the shelf <pad>
he came to the united states in <pad>
we sat down at the table with our bowls of and started eating <pad>
people can go there for many different things <pad>
at first none of us really cause we were looking around <pad>
and bubbles loves and with his duck buddies and with me in the calm <date> grass <pad>
we have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way <pad>
there are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands <pad>
i know that you can break free from it because i once experienced the same thing <pad>
we were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile <pad>
i asked my mom when we got to the hotel can i go swimming <pad>
when she is on she everything around her <pad>
a material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it <pad>
also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed <pad>
i was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film only bits and pieces of it <pad>
he felt grateful and thankful for his parents love and sacrifice <pad>
students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work <pad>
the pond was not so nice in the fact that it was very with ducks geese and of course their as well
they could also not be spending time with family <pad>
we had one class together <pad>
one of the main reasons why i think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it <pad>
there are offensive stuff all over the world so you cant avoid it every where you go <pad>
my older sister <person> was having a baby <pad>
i was next i sat on the seat the sun was right on me <pad>
she will always love her grandma <pad>
this probably should have been considered <pad>
that is exactly <caps> happened that night i regret <pad>
i used to think that talking with someone <pad>
all these safety troubles and would all together make the mooring an impossible <pad>
this <caps> though was one where our laughter made the largest impact <pad>
if you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and percent voted to get rid of that book then i think it would be okay
that example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature <pad>
my mother came over here when she was <num> <pad>
my friends and i had the biggest fight over the reason <pad>
the report had to be over the <date> and slavery <pad>

being happy and laughing with people makes a really strong connection between people <pad>
i trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people <pad>
the hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming <pad>
it can be useful to both adults and children <pad>
they hurried up and closed the door and told me to go up stairs <pad>
a lot of people are religious and their particular religion <month> be against looking at suggestive and material <pad>
thanks for taking the time to read this <pad>
in the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways <pad>
one last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly to low over the urban areas <pad>
the best true story that i could tell you that involves me and laughter is about my dad and i <pad>
this symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will
we do everything together and we always have each others back <pad>
computers also can provide fun games and entertain users <pad>
you want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean <pad>
stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out <pad>

some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other <pad>
adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them <pad>
plus i get lost because they leave me <pad>
my last reason is you can make <location> friends <pad>
the winds caused the dirigible to move too much that it became unsafe to use <pad>
she was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students <pad>
my mom said again that i have to be patient <pad>
these obstacles were not easily fixed <pad>

the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there <pad>
taking offensive books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech <pad>
<person> cleaned up the best she could but there was almost no use <pad>
but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town <pad>
a good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last
books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone <pad>
one such obstacle was safety <pad>
the greatest obstacle was said to be nature itself <pad>
when the cyclist arrived at the abandoned <caps> grape factory he felt on twist of many <pad>
computers are also needed to do research for school projects <pad>
i was getting pretty discouraged <pad>
and that is the only way you will win is by using <pad>
we wait for hours till it was finally our turn <pad>
any individual that is highly educated would see the in computer usage <pad>
the mood of this story is very positive <pad>
learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday <pad>
this shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that <pad>
i think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again <pad>

slavery and the <person> were a horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again <pad>
those are the names of my twin cousins <organization> i can honestly admit that they are <num> of the funniest kids i know
sitting at home on the couch eating a bag of potato chips <pad>
he had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit <pad>
if kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it <pad>
and to me that shows love thats why i think the author created love as his mood in the memoir <pad>
finally we came to the front of the line <pad>
computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that wont get lost <pad>
the human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more <pad>
sometimes you need take a break and slow down <pad>
then lack of water began <pad>
other than a little midnight prank <pad>
then i saw a doctor who can cure people only by laughter <pad>
you can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper <pad>
there are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about <pad>
<caps> i guess its not that far away from here <pad>
many people believe that laughter can improve your life <pad>
lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function <pad>
the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful <pad>
one of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter <pad>
we finally made it to our destination key wrap <pad>
another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind <pad>
censorship of <caps> of <caps> all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf
libraries are places of learning <pad>
also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you <pad>
if you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for <pad>
books clearly with any suggestive content the book <month> contain would help this issue tremendously <pad>
it changes from flat road to short rolling hills <pad>
libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted <pad>
i believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclists condition <pad>
the reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place <pad>
my grandparents <pad>

a lot of people in the world today are having this same question <pad>
computers <month> take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it <pad>
thats when it all came to me i saw the whole scene once again i felt horrible <pad>
the first problem they faced was the buildings original skeleton to fit the needs of the mooring mast <pad>
thats why i believe that computers have a positive effect on people <pad>
everyone has their own favorite book or genre <pad>
but some tell you what age it is suitable for <pad>
just the thought of not being down there with them made me ill <pad>
it was ironic because the germs would be preserved in the ice box it was funny i was keeping my germs alive and my mom used that ice <pad>
one reason the mood is happy is because of the setting <pad>
i was so happy that i could be so patience for so long <pad>
weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below <pad>
the call ended and i was smiling from ear to ear <pad>
another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their parents or siblings <pad>
the fashion of the <num> and <date> is just a project i did last month <pad>
the author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons <pad>
some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate <pad>
it is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over <pad>
after the meeting we went to <person> craft store <pad>
the aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in <pad>
since i did not the website all i got to play was on the computers but one day onto it and played my first driving computer game
discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day <pad>
this law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area <pad>
with this mindset i proceeded into the conference room for the first time since <person> had left <pad>
it could be the elderly all the way down to <pad>
what laughter is all <caps> laughter is the shortest distance between two people <pad>
<person> uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home <pad>
that is what i think respectful way <pad>
something in us changed that we could be a little closer <pad>
it is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole <pad>
they are <caps> because they get start a new life over <pad>
the lady at the front desk called me up <pad>
after the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean <pad>
they also hold your information <pad>
the hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply <pad>
there are so many varieties to choose from <pad>
the reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it <pad>
tumble usually means desert <pad>
i wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer <pad>
<caps> were the obstacles <pad>
my opinion on this subject is its not right <pad>
laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship <pad>
another obstacle was safety <pad>
for one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and <date> <pad>
there has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society <pad>
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas <pad>
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast <pad>
the more insight you can feel about a persons feelings the more laughter you can find deep inside a individuals well being <pad>
it was staring me right in my face so i talked to my grandparents and said we could stay <pad>
finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated <pad>
as he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere <pad>
it had to go <num> minutes without thunder for the game to resume <pad>
it also says that there was always a feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced
if you wrote a book and people did this to you how would you feel <pad>
we were shooting across the from table to table trying to people walking by <pad>
each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter <pad>
socializing over computers <month> not be as effective as socializing in person but it gives the people <pad>
a time to retake the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon <pad>
you can have conversations with all your friends and family <pad>
now the content of some books are not always appropriate <pad>
their schedule could be <pad>
i sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter <pad>
in the process the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring <pad>
well its true and computers are a great source <organization> <caps> <pad>
magazines under my arm i choose a seat in the far corner to wait in <pad>
one obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area <pad>
<caps> you want to live a long healthy life you need to get up from the computer and exercise <pad>
or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off <pad>
also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of <pad>
as a student i know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives <pad>
that is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends <pad>
the reason why i say <num> is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong and you can handle it if is wrong <pad>
my first impression of him was his cute smile <pad>
another one too small so he threw it back <pad>
my dad said that we were going shopping to get my <pad>
this caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die <pad>
wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe <pad>
lots of critics say that a computer is not educational <pad>
my brother came in and woke me up and said that everyone was out in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed
people that do not think they are offensive will read them <pad>
i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work <pad>
computers and laptops should be network to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building <pad>
she sticks her finger in the and tastes it <pad>
it is human nature to fear the unknown <pad>
the architects of the empire state building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their <pad>
maybe next birthday <caps> can them <pad>
the <organization> should never be allowed to decide what the public views <pad>
lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away <pad>
the author shows a calm mood when he says always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love <pad>
once a week we email our <pad>
first of all he rides into barren land <pad>
it stated that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself <pad>
one way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the authors past memories <pad>
there are ups and downs either way it goes <pad>
i would get it cause thats what children do explore <pad>
the greatest obstacle builders faced was nature <pad>
she means that her parents sacrificed to turn a <num> room apartment into her home <pad>
we need to preserve through every problem we go through in life <pad>
even if you and call some one they <month> not be home or answer <pad>
they keep coming up with more and more <pad>
a tear out of the corner of eye <pad>
they came selflessly this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were <pad>
in the story it says that my parents turned this simple house into a home <pad>
and you can tell hes trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle <pad>
he tried to jump on the front forks <caps> missed and fell <pad>
when the architect added a foot to the top of the building <pad>
i paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus <pad>
but i mostly think about me <pad>
and so there the <num> of us were standing there <pad>
might also be sending money by going to the computer and be sending to their family members <pad>
restrictions on renting that material could be set <pad>
my favorite thing is that my parents use email to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents <pad>
one time i was patient for the doctors and i had a great time <pad>
laughter mood and makes you feel more happy <pad>
i have never seen her so patient it was no <pad>
i know people like to think that they know everything there is to know just because they have their own ways and thoughts <pad>
some of the movies and books people find offensive can be pretty bad and say nasty things and stuff like that <pad>
their would be a change in kids education <pad>
we then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself he <month> never get to do again <pad>
the last reason that blimps could not be docked at the empire state building was that there were laws against aircrafts flying that low
people should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy <pad>
but she had herself much preferred it to a big <pad>
one problem was the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents <pad>
materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve <pad>
also they can spend more time doing things with their kids <pad>
it simply could not be read if it is not available <pad>
this allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others <pad>
laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much <pad>
i am now an for <organization> <pad>
so maybe things do need to be taken off shelves <pad>
one time i was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for about at least <num> hours <pad>
i smiled to myself and as i closed my eyes i imagined all of the laughter i would get to enjoy with these friends
the author describes the many things her parents have given to her <pad>
they were not going to take that risk <pad>
news <caps> took a pull and said more than half of <location> schools are now using computers to put homework on to save paper
all of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same <pad>
having libraries censor things would make people feel left out <pad>
<caps> carried her things to the door <pad>
if people could limit their at risk for <pad>
they were full <caps> and she wanted to bake something traditional for them <pad>
a time i was patience was when my family went to <caps> <pad>
i have to be patient every thanks giving <pad>
without computers people could not learn new things <pad>
but when i got older i was more patient <pad>
the hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes <pad>
since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty <pad>
before computers were made all people bad was their family <pad>
computers are a more positive thing than negative <pad>
the builders of the empire state building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles <pad>
nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing <pad>
it will take longer to get a reply but its still worth the wait in the end <pad>
sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people <pad>
it was an decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building <pad>
i m on my way with food i said oh <pad>
over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent <pad>
there are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by <pad>
those old men probably were never off their front porch since was in office <pad>
my third and last reason is to be organized <pad>
they had hope in their children when they came to <location> to have great and prosperous lives <pad>
in paragraph <num> it says i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice <pad>
they want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so <pad>
i once spent <num> hours on my computer on <caps> <pad>
we should never have the right to be able to remove these materials <pad>
i hope you take this into consideration and understand my for what i have said <pad>
<organization> and how to research any topic <pad>
they danced to this song a few other times that <date> <pad>
libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed <pad>
the setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way <pad>
lastly he is grateful to have grown up in a really good home <pad>
i think computers definitely have a positive effect on people <pad>
you can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away
thats the time i was patient <pad>
<person> was too busy laughing and trying to breath to tell <caps> how stupid i was <pad>
another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the empire state was nature itself <pad>
the members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled <pad>
one time when i was patient my friend <person> went to the mall around <num> am <pad>
and yes weight loss surgery does have effects such as death <pad>
they love all their friends and family and celebrate with then no matter what <pad>
not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically <pad>
<caps> people use computers for work <pad>
if i have the right to remove that book <pad>
we not even be able to communicate with some others <pad>
there is no one like <person> <pad>
that is a story about how i am patient <pad>
my cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets his way <pad>
if there were no computers i would have to use a typewriter and if i made a mistake i would have to type the whole thing again <pad>
i laugh a lot throughout the day <pad>
well thats fun and all for a few hours but some people spend a lot of time on there <pad>
one mood the author gives is a happy one <pad>
the empire state building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles <pad>
i run over pick it up and dash inside tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man <pad>
the authors gave the decision to choice between books or items <pad>
a good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them
the path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight <pad>
<num> out <num> <caps> either have no backyard or have nothing better to do <pad>
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways <pad>
i always thought how the human body works is incredible <pad>
if your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer <pad>
just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home <pad>
modifications would have to be made to the entire building <pad>
the kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group <pad>
most children are addicted to computer games <pad>
i know one of my friends love to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time <pad>
being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant <pad>
we were laughing because it was so cute that <organization> thought <caps> dad was in the <caps> <pad>
to land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds <pad>
when i got home i had learn two lessons one was not to worry about anything and i learn how to have patients <pad>
those are the obstacles that the architects of the empire state building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there <pad>
i told you that you guys would love <caps> <pad>
that will affect me in very negative way <pad>
my parents turned this simple house into a home <pad>
ill describe more of what i mean in the following letter <pad>
when you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip <pad>
it was probably the best time of that <date> <pad>
they came selflessly <pad>
other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead on the back of them so they could not move <pad>
for the reason that its their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all <pad>
the hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination
there would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated <pad>
and its whatever they believe in is how it should go <pad>
teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed <pad>
he always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long <pad>
<num> more groups got called <pad>
and to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something <pad>
but when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends <pad>
if thats not the case then parents should keep them away from the content <pad>
to me the flower is a symbol to the author that her to keep trying <pad>
when we got to <location> we went on every ride in the park <pad>
finally the computer is a great place to find information and enlighten yourself <pad>
you can also talk to people on them <pad>
he sad when i tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid <pad>
the problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead <pad>
i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean <pad>
the library should keep certain books at the library such as the bible and collage books <pad>
learning about other places is fun <pad>
i began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave
they should be aloud to be removed because some books are offensive <pad>
you cant help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch <pad>
well we went there because my dad was making a golf coarse <pad>
it was very cold and it was even <pad>
they have censored movies just sitting there <pad>
a <num> and final reason i think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family <pad>
maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone <pad>
a second problem is shown in the quote the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents <pad>
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice <pad>
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice <pad>
this will come off offensive to many men and women <pad>
censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for <pad>
the mood that is created by this story is admiration <pad>
finally they help people to keep in touch and meet knew people <pad>
to overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame <pad>
that magazines purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance <pad>
and maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer <pad>
the people would not be the only thing out of hand <pad>
another obstacle faced was the brutal winds which occur at such a high altitude <pad>
i will tell you about a time wen i was patient <pad>
thats a time i was patient <pad>
no one spoke on the ride home <pad>
one kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends <pad>
there are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full <pad>
on the website you can talk with anyone on your friends list <pad>
i know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone <pad>

chats rooms are cool to <pad>
i got out a piece of play and i made it into the <caps> i put it on the top of the tower <pad>
after the school we discovered that my bus had been in a minor accident so i had to be driven to school that day <pad>
the answer in the question world war <caps> <pad>
its part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us <pad>
some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf <pad>
the plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her <pad>
just because you think the music a person to is offensive does not mean they think the same <pad>
as every day people are getting in touch with technology they are losing touch with the world around them <pad>
there are better entertainment active and will keep us healthy and exercising <pad>
when <organization> came inside he looked in every room and could not find <caps> dad <pad>

the hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her <pad>
censorship should not be allowed in libraries <pad>
we all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time <pad>
we both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like <pad>
keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this <pad>
exercise is important to your body and computers are not <pad>
thats why i believe that computers have a positive effect on people <pad>
this shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are <pad>
to <caps> a <caps> is a classic example of this <pad>
one of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a cable tether then stress would be put on the buildings frame
the violent air currents and high winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely tether itself to the top of the empire building <pad>
sometime those things are peoples life and all they do <pad>
the cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty <pad>
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof <pad>
i did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late <pad>
is extremely accurate for most <pad>
<caps> mood is caring my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family <pad>
you never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as possible around animals <pad>
your should be <num> or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad <pad>
<caps> i agree that would be fun <pad>
he also says that they have done a more courageous thing than he could ever do <pad>
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents <pad>
another time where computers are handy is at tax time <pad>
it was the violent winds <pad>
one obstacle was nature itself <pad>
your relationship involves love and laughter <pad>
it was <num> am and my dads favorite music was on <caps> we stayed and watched the whole movie <pad>
there are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph <pad>
hes so on the <caps> <pad>
the sad truth is that it never happened <pad>
<caps> is my personal belief that and are the best emotional states to be in <pad>
creates a good relationship <pad>
that mall was crowded <pad>

it is real relaxing to me <pad>
these features in setting are cruel <pad>
i think censorship is our society <pad>

the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents <pad>
you must practice patience and give them respect <pad>
the dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights <pad>
in that point of view you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves <pad>

laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other <pad>
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation <pad>
i had to go to work with my dad <pad>
laughter is the shortest distance between two people <pad>

i think the mood in the memoir is love <pad>
we tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of <pad>

it is basically any information in a click <pad>
people view offensive writing and actions differently from one another <pad>
i know the answer to that question <pad>
laughter is the best medicine many people say laughter is the best medicine <pad>
another big problem is education <pad>
maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed <pad>
i wish everyone would do the same <pad>
a kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing <pad>
this concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem <pad>
the lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two <pad>
it makes the reader feel admiration towards his parents and the author is trying to create a sense of appreciation and gratitude towards his parents
the builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building <pad>
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents <pad>
<caps> we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose <pad>
she finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home <pad>

that is a time i was patience <pad>
i believe the quote stated above is quite true <pad>
there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there <pad>
another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas <pad>
another reason is that it shows strength <pad>
if it got a hole in it then it would catch on fire <pad>
computers have a positive effect on people of all ages <pad>
we rent a large cabin that is right on the water side <pad>
dress up to educational <pad>
very many people are just too protective <pad>

i realized that laugh could change everything <pad>
being my mother was watching the news i took him up on his offer <pad>
an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas <pad>
a lot of teenagers have no patience <pad>
the problems this would have caused was the pressure on the buildings foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles <pad>
s i think we are not <pad>
this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist <pad>
a dirigible would only be held by one cable <pad>
if things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section
more than sixty thousand dollars was spent on the frame <pad>

after walking around a while this girl talked to me <pad>
there were many different moods throughout the passage <pad>
again i had to question myself i could be patient enough one by one people were getting in <pad>
another reason is because of the snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him <pad>
reason three your health is at risk <pad>
then i hit a rock and did a front <pad>
the last reason was the law against airships <pad>
i had missed about an of the game already <pad>
<caps> proceeded to walk over to the group <pad>
the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof <pad>
i <caps> been patient <pad>
the author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir <pad>
they can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that particular item is considered offensive <pad>
the surgery took five hours <pad>
another reason was because of existing laws was airships flying too low over populated or urban areas <pad>
people enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to <pad>
the first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock <pad>
these obstacles included safety and <pad>
the computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of <pad>
she had to take a test but failed it <pad>
it can be useful to you when you have a report coming up <pad>
we think it might have broke <pad>
blimps would not be able to fly close enough without the wind pushing it <pad>

the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse

<caps> i set up six bottles and was ready to shoot <pad>
flop i fell into the black chair and waited <pad>
i remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason <pad>
like the time where i met this guy named <person> <pad>
i believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that is also as enjoyable on it is
a final problem that the builders faced was a law that airships flying too low over urban areas <pad>
i really hope the people make the right choice <pad>
this problem is similar to others around the world <pad>
he read five books and only got a half <organization> a page <organization> notes for his assignment <pad>

my friend spent <num> hours on those websites <pad>
the theater was cozy and warm for being out in the cold for <num> hours <caps> felt good <pad>
another reason is using the empire state building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe <pad>
