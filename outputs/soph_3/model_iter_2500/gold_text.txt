thus computers are vital to as humans <pad>
for example many parents do not want their children reading listening or watching certain things <pad>
he would live on telling people not to listen to old men <pad>
i am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring <pad>
overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up <pad>
it was hard for them but they got by and did a great job <pad>
because of the internet there is basically no more boredom <pad>
someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves just because it be offensive to them or there way of life <pad>
should be taken off the shelf because <pad>
a while back my family and i were trying to plan a trip to visit <pad>
there is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to <pad>
the things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world <pad>
there is a new look everywhere on earth <pad>
i believe that the mood created by the author is happy and loving <pad>
a customers needs and wants should be met at all times unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own <pad>
should books music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive <pad>
love is shown a lot through family in this memoir <pad>
have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us <pad>
every since i was ten years old i dreamed of going to <pad>
this is not good because they should be out having fun not on the computer all day <pad>
her hibiscus would keep her culture tradition and memories alive as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in <pad>
if a library that i visit has censoring on most of their materials i would convince the library staff to take the censoring off <pad>
an artist or will write rap and sing songs about what they want <pad>
furthermore censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons <pad>
sitting in your room bored <pad>
the author concludes the story with this because its winter now the flowers are gone but during that time when she was planting she grew more mature
this is affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends <pad>
computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate <pad>
computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things <pad>
i think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love <pad>
that is what i choose to do and i would say it is working out great <pad>
it is the people around you causing the offensive news <pad>
he just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid <pad>
lord was one of the greatest religious teachers who ever lived in the world <pad>
as a student i use my computer for my schoolwork <pad>
internet is great for communication <pad>
the author is happy that had a real family <pad>
the in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government <pad>
my first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world <pad>
the people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do <pad>
both me and think that this is affecting people in many different ways <pad>
those are the people that i grew up with and have known since birth <pad>
my cousins however do not teach their children about <pad>
the idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless <pad>
sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive because they are actually telling you what they really believe in <pad>
i was so thrilled when i was finally able to check out the book and read it <pad>
many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist <pad>
for instance you have to look at all of the different races customs and more of what people believe in to find the true answer <pad>
sports are something that everyone loves to participate in and something that everyone likes <pad>
it seem like i am on a lot but really i have something <pad>
from the experience that i have had with books that cause controversy i have noticed myself not liking the book <pad>
eventually after reaching a source of running water he is with happiness and relief <pad>
they do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big happy family <pad>
some might not be appropriate for young children to read <pad>
this is effecting people negatively <pad>
there are websites containing the geography languages and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn <pad>
this is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note <pad>
not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see <pad>
the magic of mutual love will bring boundless joy as love knows no weariness <pad>
part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it <pad>
its up too the too know whats good for them <pad>
you can play mindless video games <pad>
it has great value <pad>
the main characters job as a is not to put out fires but to set books on fire that encourage people to think <pad>
however either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away <pad>
so when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost <pad>
there were snakes in the road which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit <pad>
these libraries would be loosing business to the people who maybe like the kind of stuff that they not <pad>
where ever you look you can find a computer <pad>
or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of <pad>
people should use a more often <pad>
censorship could take away your favorite series of books of the public library because of group of people thought it was offensive <pad>
the quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly <pad>
now when he comes to work he is happier and making more papers and if he makes more papers you make more money <pad>

this is one very important reason student use computer to research projects <pad>
so when she sees the geese and this symbolizes change <pad>
i think the effects will be severe reality creating false and offering no physical gain <pad>
when she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time
almost of people in other countries be very lonely because all they is play on the computer and forget about other people <pad>
people always have a choice <pad>
as a child you want to explore and know everything <pad>
fortunately my prediction came true <pad>
numerous flight and driving are available on the consumer market <pad>
it is the parents job to regulate the readings of their children but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf <pad>
not only would it make people happier it would make the world better <pad>
some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something <pad>
when it comes to books music movies or magazines i believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol <pad>
censorship to a book is like cake without the its taking away the value and fun out of education <pad>
people use computers to communicate with people far away <pad>
it is a great way to keep in contact <pad>
it is very beautify place and i am very like to spend the evening in the home garden <pad>
as soon as the bus arrived all the passengers ran to board it <pad>

a close family friend of ours just bought a computers <pad>

he is not a rich man <pad>
so as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things <pad>
some other books though are meant for educational use and not meant to offend anyone <pad>
when the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence <pad>
if the parent does not want their child to go into a section then the parents can just say keep away from that area <pad>
me for example i love working and playing on the computer <pad>
computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn communicate with another others <pad>
the flowers laden with dew merrily wave their heads and spread their fragrance <pad>
with the new year in christmas sets in high spirits for the festive mood <pad>
i hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind <pad>
others might argue that they have the right to read listen and watch what they would like <pad>
i believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight <pad>
magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people <pad>
i will be talking about how computers give people good typing skills how they give information to people and how they allow us to socialize <pad>
and i could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to <pad>
another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because all the online chat rooms they have <pad>
looking at places far away is always an option <pad>
three they can develop a sense of typing <pad>
the feeling that the uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had <pad>
hobby is constructive <pad>
sometimes people cannot call each other because its too long distance <pad>

with the next town miles away the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there <pad>
before computers and calculating took more time but now they get our work done quickly and without error <pad>
i think that computers are very helpful <pad>
a negative issue with having computers with internet certain websites that are not age able <pad>
that choice to look at that magazine read that book or listen to that song should be left up to them not made for them <pad>
this way you can see your family from miles away in the comfort of your own home <pad>
dear computers have a positive impact on people <pad>
how about the capital of a state that visit slipped your <pad>
every person poses their own opinions on life <pad>
when surveyed the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night <pad>
he was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time <pad>
computers help us look information talk to people around the world and buy stuff from our house <pad>
her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared <pad>
although some materials be offensive they should not be removed from the libraries <pad>
at this point the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the
in the modern world nearly all businesses rely on communication <pad>
one reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise <pad>
they moved from their country so that he could grow up in <pad>
books movies music and magazines <pad>
by writing the story the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort <pad>
i also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across <pad>
over of the owns at least one computer in their house <pad>
dear local newspaper i also agree that computers have a positive effect on people <pad>
it deals with the science of information processing recording and information <pad>
if we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the bible <pad>
if computers are so great now just imagine what they will be like in or years <pad>
some believe that they help us learn but i just say so do books <pad>
so when asked we can show our age <pad>
furthermore there are too many advertisements on <pad>
in short censorship is a harmful practice that should never be used <pad>
a social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see <pad>
lastly who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports to stay active and have fun <pad>
in fact the are the best bet for a better future <pad>
dear that use computers is a good thing <pad>
this same thing applies with movies <pad>
everyday i would go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basket ball <pad>
what would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish <pad>
when all of these details combined along with language such as <pad>
basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive v was etched against the evening sky slowly facing into the distance <pad>
the abandoned building and there being no people could affect him emotionally <pad>
my last reason is because on a computer you pretty much look for anything <pad>
these encounters create an interesting meal <pad>
lastly when all else fails the computer can be a great way to relax and clear your mind <pad>
this gives you a feeling of the home being warm comfortable and most of all alive <pad>
once it is gone it will be forgotten <pad>
believing he was going to die the cyclist got back on his bike <pad>
i don believe it should work that way <pad>
those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves <pad>
these event would stay in her memory <pad>
in many cases the censorship of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy <pad>
using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the mouse with the one in your hand <pad>
but for important about a home work and some people at theirs <pad>
moreover computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world <pad>
for some reason out of people like to go to far away places for example put or <pad>
as the day went on he felt the heat bearing down on him <pad>
then the girl went missing for about weeks <pad>
but with the help people are lively and happy including with friend <pad>
the story is about a named and a boy named <pad>
almost anything published or shown to the public went through a computer <pad>
because of that there should be no restrictions in the public libraries and you should be able to get the books or movies you want <pad>
if you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out you will then know what i am saying <pad>
then the item will be shipped to your door <pad>
i think that it is showing new beginning that she will have to go through the next year <pad>
does that make sense <pad>
for instance i was hearing that the first time <pad>
all the websites like that help you stay in touch with all of your friends <pad>
it also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house <pad>
they can teach us about things <pad>
turns out i was fine <pad>
there are movies that will have some sort of sexual reference a cigarette or a bad word in them <pad>
people can also learn new things <pad>
without books that are considered offensive we would not have any books to read at all <pad>
the mood that this author set was that of love and compassion and he did a very good job of explaining what his childhood home meant to him
knowledge is theoretical <pad>
and with computers this is possible <pad>
in conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way <pad>
and if someone was allowed to censor things what would be included <pad>
dear local newspaper i am going to write to you about if i think computers are a good idea or not <pad>
most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow <pad>
there would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated <pad>
of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one <pad>
many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences <pad>
of the surveyed at the agree computers are helpful to us <pad>
it could of been making spread sheet editing someones or getting new <pad>
finally computers have established amazing entertainment for people of all ages <pad>
people spend to much time on computer <pad>
kids pick up some bad language from the books they read <pad>
these are the people that just sit on the computer all day <pad>
there are all kinds of books movies and even magazines out there <pad>
others should ruin the experience by the words out <pad>
also people of different religion could find it offensive <pad>
hard work is the key to success <pad>
there is a sofa set a dining table and a <pad>
being is a trend that millions of people adhere to <pad>
as humans have become with technology most humans lose the physical interaction that they world normally have encountered if they we not on the computer <pad>
it you fail then try again <pad>
if they are exercising who if i am here on the computer <pad>
why would you look at something that offends you <pad>
some people get obese by doing this <pad>
when you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one because the salesman talks then into it <pad>
but it seem of many challenges to the man in front <pad>
dear a student i believe that computers have many bad effects on people <pad>
you might not know it all the communications in the world need a <pad>
she knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter she could survive living somewhere new <pad>
once my class was assigned to do a book project <pad>
the worst is probably watching bad things <pad>
the were showing their skills <pad>
are some themes which can guide us to a noble path <pad>
you are allowed to express your opinion about it but taking it away cause you not like it is wrong to do <pad>
would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good <pad>
the lights of the nearby houses and of the bridge threw beams of silver in the river <pad>
in doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people <pad>
my friend was not happy <pad>
the staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do <pad>
but the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it <pad>
most of the books magazines and movies are all by little children <pad>
they miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the or going out and playing in the snow and making or having a fight <pad>
i frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college <pad>
another example is when it says tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me <pad>
you can be on the computer and still listen to music <pad>
she is an expert in teaching <pad>
they are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives <pad>
they start to engage in activities that were once upon <pad>
many programs are used to help people in their lives <pad>
have you ever been to a library <pad>
they are great for communication learning and shopping <pad>
i am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people <pad>
that is how the cyclist is affected by his setting and despair is turned to hope <pad>
strikes and is your count <pad>
that is how the author sets the mood <pad>
in this memoir there are moods created by the author in the memoir <pad>
of will agree they spend at least hours a day on their computer <pad>
on the computer you can chat with people from anywhere <pad>
in books are censored <pad>
sometimes life can feel so cruel <pad>
scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school <pad>
however there is one plant that is similar the winter hibiscus <pad>
the hibiscus in the story has her home and her grandmother which symbolize happiness so she will be happier when things get better <pad>
i think all things should not be judged by assumption <pad>
my first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people <pad>
another opinion is that i think people should not spend most of there time on the computer <pad>
however that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of <pad>
when i was a little girl i remember going to the often with my mother to pick out books for school <pad>
no one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet <pad>
no matter what there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by <pad>
some people have family in another country <pad>
instead of sitting on the computer for an hour you could be getting your hour of exercise <pad>
if your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day one week can your vision from a to <pad>
the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed speed limit has a great effect on the main character in the story <pad>
my address was also posted because that message was a mobile upload <pad>
part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change <pad>
i believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involve offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset <pad>
so she is not being into taking it <pad>
well you can shop online <pad>
it is a big deal if your cursing all the time but most kids know better and know not to do bad stuff <pad>
computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers <pad>
i think that this would be fair for everyone <pad>
i believe these are good to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them <pad>
second have you ever asked your self about much time you ever spend with friends and family <pad>
i personally think that if people could do that they would but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you <pad>
we should be string enough to look away and not fight about it <pad>
one reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information <pad>
but any ways those are reasons why <pad>
take my friend she was online one day when a man started to talk to her <pad>
there were no computers this hand eye coordination could never developed <pad>
one person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive
you look at the screen type your words look at the screen again while clicking your mouse <pad>
of course this could effect a child in a negative way <pad>
i just think that people should write for the pure joy of it not to persuade people to do something give bad thoughts or ideas <pad>
there is some other things that are bad about computers too for example my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day
that situation could go both ways though <pad>
she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home lest she burst into tears again <pad>
computers also let people learn new things <pad>
this also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again <pad>
this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful <pad>
would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen <pad>
they can tell you anything <pad>
stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes <pad>
when i was younger i owned a computer <pad>
then more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out <pad>
you have children you can lose the ability to watch them grow up to adults and can even push them away <pad>
he describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting <pad>
no is to judge what we see and hear <pad>
the outcome of that is success <pad>
so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing <pad>
since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty <pad>
this is why she concluded the story with a vow <pad>
he should have packed an extra bottle of water <pad>
we all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty and little puppies <pad>
spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight <pad>
reading using computers working at a table <pad>
after school kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing <pad>
also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject <pad>
course not and do you want to miss your flight for vacation <pad>
i felt like i was right their with her <pad>
another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online <pad>
they can be done only by the help of a computer <pad>
i at once rushed outside <pad>
which will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test <pad>
all you need is a support from your family <pad>
next people begin to lose exercise <pad>
to me i think computers are a positive effect on people <pad>
the mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents <pad>
a recent study shows that out of families who purchased a computer in the last year have their exercise and play time <pad>
dear i believe that computers do benefit society <pad>
they are getting to books movies and music for free unless it becomes over due <pad>
on a computer you can learn about new places <pad>
dear local newspaper i just wanted to say that i do i agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer
we should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for hours at a time <pad>
give people the choice <pad>
as the winter starts fading away and the heat begins to people pack up their <pad>
if people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library <pad>
they are not required to look at it so if they do not like it then they do not look at it <pad>
more than of most students in an average school have one <pad>
i traveled by train with my mother <pad>
how do we keep these sorts of material away from them <pad>
those who complain are only making more work for themselves <pad>
starting their lives over again and taking any job they could find <pad>
there will always be certain books that some of us find offensive <pad>
lack of good food good homes and poverty are some of them <pad>
i think that because of many reasons and i will tell you some of these reasons <pad>
you need a computer for projects <pad>
in this memoir the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood <pad>
if you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained you can go on or other sites and find any song you want to hear
it also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience <pad>
in this shows us that was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him <pad>
the tall trees against the sky made a beautiful <pad>
the author created several different moods in this memoir <pad>
because some people like stuff other people find offensive <pad>
libraries also have some offensive items in them <pad>
people can think what they want to think about offensive material <pad>
teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games i know i do <pad>
little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff <pad>
no your just sitting there using the computer involves very little movement <pad>
the internet hold false information and can be a waste peoples time <pad>
they might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read but some people are more visual with the movie <pad>

everyone has their own likes and dislikes not two peoples are the same <pad>
when you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house <pad>
when the author write and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding then i will take that test again it shows symbolism <pad>
and go on the computer <pad>
some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends <pad>
in my opinion it would be beneficial to students parents or teachers to get information on different topics <pad>
at most jobs you have to know how to work a computer <pad>
all you have to do is search it on your computer <pad>
and the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves <pad>
i think computers work because it helps people with there own work <pad>

computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them <pad>
there are also educational purposes for computers <pad>
all magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is <pad>
this is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer <pad>
everyone deserves to read watch and listen to whatever they choose but not everyone deserves to be around inappropriate things in public places <pad>
this quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed <pad>
the mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love <pad>
do you think that books music movies magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored <pad>
even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people the books or other items should be left on the shelves <pad>
the government does not want the society especially the youth of to read things that are deemed inappropriate <pad>

in the story rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist <pad>
sometimes the best thing to is get some fresh air and interact with others <pad>
people will always have something to do when they are bored there is plenty to learn and it keeps you organized <pad>

also i used to be big as in overweight because i never went outside to exercise or in my own room <pad>
imagine what else could happen by staying of computers <pad>
i have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content <pad>
my second reason why is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want <pad>
when the recess periods is over they get back to their classrooms to start their studies again <pad>
do computers society <pad>
the outcome of this story and the was determined by their setting <pad>

that is why will need technology <pad>
he or she should not throw a over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable <pad>
the building is an abandoned grape juice factory which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in <pad>
the above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist <pad>
i listened to rock music at the time and loved how the artist was <pad>
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills <pad>
computers its all we hear about today <pad>
most people today neglect punctuality <pad>
therefore new exercises moves or tricks online can help them out a lot <pad>
most people think that computers are just new helpful technology but there is more to it than just that <pad>
if something is typed into results will pop up within seconds <pad>
for example when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones <pad>
a whole cycle of being and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful <pad>
they give us so many such good things and yet expect nothing in return <pad>
from these reasons our lives because easy and convenient which is what people strive to accomplish <pad>
we can not talk to my family or friends <pad>
dear local newspaper i feel that the people using computers benefits our society <pad>

you walk in and take a piece <pad>
these machines get our messages and vices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds <pad>
using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time <pad>
if we removed books that offended even one person then no books would remain <pad>
all libraries have books for all readers no matter the age <pad>
in the kitchen celebrations childhood friends and family formed the backdrop to their life <pad>
although other things have affects on youth books are a different story <pad>
these setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride <pad>
if all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this <pad>
the censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next <pad>
as a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir <pad>
while growing up i had a friend who was very religious <pad>
so in my opinion computers do benefit society <pad>
if he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case <pad>
unfortunately trees are being cut <pad>
besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly <pad>
the computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed
not very often or that i have ever seen do the authors make a book to just to put someone down <pad>
then came large rolling hills which created a challenge the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue <pad>
the webcam allows me to see me grandma <pad>
dear local newspaper name is and writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society <pad>
censorship was originally started during the in with the <pad>
three there is a better way to solve this problem <pad>
so the should think about what i am saying <pad>
this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep eat computer <pad>
all of us have rights all of us have the same chance to express what we feel think or believe <pad>
when you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen
she longed for her natural home and familiarity <pad>

we needed it to thrive <pad>
the cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy <pad>
dad found out about and he decided to try it out <pad>
that is not a mothers dream to go and do that <pad>
books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years <pad>
he is talking about how he had such a good life in the house <pad>
censoring books magazines movies etc and what goes onto the shelves are mostly for enjoyment or informational <pad>
lastly computers can be very dangerous <pad>
so there is a lot of reasons why i think that people should remove certain book movies magazines or anything that involves offensive stuff <pad>
he mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story <pad>
i understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people <pad>
this is obvious shown it states in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding <pad>
in this book a young girl is raped very harshly <pad>
computers have technical problems that delete files <pad>
these are reason why computer could be a good devices <pad>
one example is because he said they where all family to them <pad>
clearly a life without computers is utter chaos <pad>
drew a park says <pad>
he explains his parents <pad>
even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas <pad>
well i think the mood of the story is great <pad>
instead of drawing it the internet can save time and effort <pad>
parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much <pad>
the computer cant do for you <pad>
so instead of staying home all day i walked down to the library <pad>
in my letter going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society <pad>
if books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already <pad>
she will take the test again <pad>
these features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him <pad>
another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time <pad>
computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions <pad>
the use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are <pad>
on my last birthday my father gifted me a toy plane <pad>
i think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in library <pad>
also everyone has different interests <pad>
in some countries do allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases even watch television at all
when going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help <pad>
lastly all the people who their imagination off computers all those people who put that thoughts and feelings into the computer <pad>
censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings because of nude statues and the way they talked <pad>
she is very careful of our <pad>
a library is a place to go and find books music and other things <pad>
that book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past <pad>
people are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family <pad>
computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today <pad>
they seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity <pad>
they will majority impact your future and impact all people in a bad way <pad>
it would also keep people from loosing books <pad>
rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house <pad>
instead via internet <pad>
the main affect is the lack of water <pad>
we place ourselves in an environment that is specifically created to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity <pad>
if somebody gets offensive about a censored material they are going to report it and cause the rate to drop low <pad>
if you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies <pad>
his water supply is running how and he is dehydrated <pad>
if they are constantly listening to foul language and what not that is going to just stay into a persons mind <pad>
not just physical skills but computers help with research skills <pad>
i think if this does happen it will be hard to get over an stop using the computer <pad>
computers also allow you to take out anger on ones and <pad>
such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk <pad>
since he cant find water he has to conserve what he has <pad>
lastly you can even have fun relax and type out your papers for reports <pad>
one example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join <pad>
also the tone of which said this showed hope she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass <pad>
we need books music movies and even magazines but we need them all together <pad>
sometimes it is just necessary <pad>
it makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that <pad>
my next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online <pad>
maybe a great song that made you happy or a movie that made you laugh <pad>
it could prevent you from spending time with family and friend and can even push them away <pad>
that does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though <pad>
the man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do <pad>
yet not all parents allow their twelve year old to watch a rated movie <pad>
no one should be denied the chance to learn <pad>
almost everyone who has a gets a blast surfing the internet <pad>
will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children this is how it should be
people could be in a dark room all day isolated from everyone they came about just because they are on the computer <pad>
all these things make up peoples lives <pad>
his parents gave up their jobs and had to start their lives over entirely <pad>
then it was decorated <pad>
if you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve <pad>
many of them not be appropriate but whenever you walk into the library its almost as if they are promoting drugs alcohol and sex <pad>
that meaning was that you cannot punish the innocent because they have done nothing wrong <pad>
the government is trying to control us with censorship <pad>
the book is more then just that one part of <pad>
i read book almost on all subjects <pad>
the rest her family still lives in <pad>
first off i do like censorship laws to an extent <pad>
that other person might want to use the material but because of restrictions set by the first person the borrowing of the work becomes <pad>
everything he had trouble with he found directly on the computer <pad>
she is somewhat hard of hearing <pad>
now they are putting those same books in libraries <pad>
computers teach you hand eye coordination they give you the ability to learn about far away places and allow you to communicate with others online <pad>
i could hear the strong icy wind blowing outside <pad>
just remember to be careful <pad>
but little did i know she woke up and me watching this horror film called <pad>
computers are every where in a schools homes band business across a <pad>
remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story the <pad>
they can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble <pad>
this cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing <pad>
my final reason kids get tired from being on the computer for so long <pad>
sometimes people have handwriting <pad>
i believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves <pad>
computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues <pad>
if you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read <pad>
if you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section
exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports you should jog a couple times of day <pad>
short rolling hills are harder on a body than flat terrain <pad>
people will be amazed <pad>
dear computers have helped us in many ways <pad>
dear i believe that using computers has a benefit to the community <pad>
just that one picture shows your team name your last name and your number <pad>
you can do many things on it <pad>
so when i got home i went on my laptop and looked it up so i did and it said nothing about <pad>
just like the temperature problem the loss of determination could eventually make him lose consciousness <pad>
the school was full of boys and girls <pad>
in addition computers also let people learn about faraway places about different cultures and different people <pad>
all those thing are some positive benefits people have computers <pad>
meaning shell survive also <pad>
i also have had a few bad reading experiences <pad>
dear newspaper people believe that the negatives of computers out weigh the positives <pad>
the dusty dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author <pad>
computers are an excellent source of knowledge but that could be a problem <pad>
he took one look at the game saw the rating for it and said that i had to have an adult with me to purchase the game <pad>
you can get help in school work also <pad>
secondly too much time spent on the computer affect your ability to communicate with others <pad>
people will always read no matter what <pad>
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home <pad>
parents like to protect their children from way and bring them up as fine citizens of <pad>
second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then <pad>
in conclusion the author created in mood through this memoir that family has many different meanings <pad>
computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world <pad>
the fact of the matter is if good stuff is out there then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too <pad>
do you know that a very high cause of obesity is <pad>
people need to interact with real people <pad>
the type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and mood <pad>
simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints <pad>
not in our population but the size of our people <pad>
also you can waist lots of energy to <pad>
people can also contact other people <pad>
these are the fantastic things you can do on the computer to have a better relationship <pad>
many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos <pad>
a person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others <pad>
there is always a smile on his face <pad>
did you know people can loose weight by exercising <pad>
another feature of the setting is very old and dirty <pad>
gather your family and plan a trip <pad>
many people base their actions on their own views <pad>
if the setting were different this story would not have been as <pad>
the second reason why computers are bad is because of what people past on the computer about other people <pad>
even as it is now parents try to hid such things from their children <pad>
i strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down <pad>
in conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried <pad>
just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book <pad>
the library has a section for children only <pad>
every single book that is made today has a right to be read <pad>
no one should we from a book due to age race gender or any other factor <pad>
every book has a different experience that can help a child learn <pad>
you could instant message them <pad>
one reason i support computers is because they help with writing <pad>
when you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything <pad>
although this information be in a local library <pad>
dear i strongly believe that computers are great <pad>
i was that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age <pad>
when you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it <pad>
but it can easily get lost <pad>
and they do help people that have physical needs <pad>
the problem is that each families limits and values are unique we cannot just assume anything about families in general <pad>
because i think she feels hope and faith <pad>
the computer is also a great device to use for learning <pad>
so i would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community <pad>
i found one that looked very interesting i got it and started to read it <pad>
my opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out
firstly students would chat their friends on the computer <pad>
she can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and hibiscus is budding <pad>
another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers <pad>
this idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home <pad>
say you gotta old kid and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book <pad>
third and last interact with your family and friends <pad>
so in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral <pad>
during childhood every kid has many questions some their parents might not be able to answer <pad>
i strongly believe computers do benefit society <pad>
whether it or whether its or all are a great way to communicate with people <pad>
i remember this one time when i was watching channel news and a years kid from playing a computer game for too long <pad>
libraries should not have to remove books music movies magazines etc <pad>
and it was times better and free and better <pad>
firstly many people can talk long distance with family of friends <pad>
they never can do anything like going outside and doing sports <pad>
do not censor what libraries put out such as books music movies and magazines <pad>
for example you would not see me reading a scary book because it would just remind me of the movie and i would have <pad>
the books are arranged in <pad>
this is how the author creates the mood in the story <pad>
for example i help my sister with her multiplication on a math game we have <pad>
plus you can plan vacation to a place and be sure you will have enough money by checking the price online <pad>
he was the first author to do <pad>
they should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have <pad>
result is nothing but a big chaos <pad>
there are not for entertainment and things of that nature <pad>
when was a good smile run <pad>
evidently excessive computer use could have very effects in a natural disaster even to adults so we need to stop it <pad>
join a team instead of playing on the computer and <pad>
these are the only ideas that i have that would work well <pad>
they are either black or green in colour <pad>
television is basically the same for movies <pad>
some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well <pad>
almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it <pad>
nothing ask yourself that <pad>
moreover statistics show that of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day <pad>
so many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong <pad>
surely this effect could be very serious <pad>
the heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water <pad>
the most beautiful part of its body is the long tail <pad>
dear computers play a huge role in society <pad>
it does not bother you <pad>
however the issue changes completely when one considers children <pad>
parents should not let there kid go to the library without them if they are scared for them to do something or look at something bad <pad>
i could drop from a heatstroke he says <pad>
men in their sunday best and women and children in all colors of rainbow added to the atmosphere <pad>
the water was taken out of the man’s belly <pad>
and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as <pad>
you find a book that is immature to you but you do not have to read it <pad>
a place where people live and get shelter is a house there are two kinds of houses <pad>
when the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps he decided to check it out and see if there is any water <pad>
its up too the parents to assist their <pad>
for example the commercials for gum with that woman some people might consider that offensive <pad>
so watch what you put online there is always some way to find what you had posted even once <pad>
last but not least would be <pad>
here are my reasons on the effect on computers <pad>
firstly the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports <pad>
i know their are people that will agree or disagree but what i think they should do is leave them <pad>
you can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple days before <pad>
if they have a right to remove anything from the shelves so does everyone <pad>
they help function machines <pad>
a recent study shows that of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks <pad>
it is really all up to the person they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice <pad>
call someone a fool we compare him to a is not so foolish as we think <pad>
the cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey <pad>
they can bring people together <pad>
movies tell you what it is rated <pad>
this kept us active and enjoy the environment <pad>
have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years <pad>
those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people <pad>
computer can also be helpful at time when needed for school or you job <pad>
if i do not like it then i just change the song <pad>

if a strict would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended <pad>
life would be very difficult without them <pad>
they travel places with people at their fingertips <pad>
people would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others <pad>
while i was at the library there was a gigantic storm <pad>
well i have good reasons as to why computers are good technology <pad>
our labs are well equipped <pad>
everybody in the community acted like they were like they were blood related but in reality nobody was <pad>
is always exceptions to whatever people say <pad>
once a kid owned a library card they were allowed to check out any book they wanted out of the huge selection of items in a library
i think censorship is our society <pad>
the snake that he came upon must have been rather intimidating <pad>
our bodies need this <pad>
with the most common themes of sex drugs and money it seem offensive to some citizens but others just it off as a <pad>
it help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of <pad>
obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being basically addicted to the computer <pad>
what did you use to search for this knowledge <pad>
there are even games for educational fun that many kids love <pad>
so i logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture language and much more <pad>
he had two tickets for the movie i wished to see <pad>
is the censorship in libraries really necessary <pad>
money can also contribute to the addiction <pad>
if you disagree with the book or whatever it be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it <pad>
after receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions <pad>
having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away <pad>
normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free <pad>
some material when reached to a specific town can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community <pad>
this is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults and children parents <pad>
after an hour she took us back to the bus and we all came back to the school <pad>
there are so many thing that you would be missing out on <pad>
so many people love to type on a keyboard as well but so many different papers that you type could be lost <pad>
this shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was <pad>
computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population <pad>
young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful <pad>
the cyclist thought he was going to die <pad>
too much time on computer <pad>
the weather can always be found on time web for any in the world <pad>
also i could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says with any luck id hit a bump and lodge a in my throat <pad>
i do not believe that people should be given the right to do that <pad>
i think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change <pad>

in conclusion i think computers are helpful because you can learn play and talk to people <pad>
someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want <pad>
the books movies and other materials should be marked saying that they be found offensive <pad>

many people would be made mad if this did happen <pad>
the overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness struggle courage good outcome and beloved memories <pad>
his isolation while cycling down the shortcut was a definite factor in his strain <pad>
in conclusion the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness <pad>
it would allow people to learn about places all over the world <pad>

plus you are not being forced to something you want to <pad>

the author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head <pad>

businesses thrive in other countries <pad>
i went on about how my dad would not care if i bought this game <pad>
if they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh thing
she still has hope of passing the drivers test <pad>

lastly computers provide games for your personal entertainment which helps kill boredom <pad>
also some people are computer who stay on computers almost twenty four seven <pad>

the author was clearly in a struggle against the desert heat <pad>
just like weather people always want to know breaking news <pad>
at the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect <pad>
in conclusion i remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when sick so that could cheer me up <pad>
for this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library <pad>
all you need to do is print out the pictures <pad>

i think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere <pad>
i know plenty of people who type their feeling because they would never dare say them a loud <pad>
i get so frustrated that i hardly take bath or eat breakfast <pad>

computers have made our generation very intelligent <pad>
whether it be in books music movies magazines or anything else <pad>
it has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day <pad>
i have to do a lot of math problems for homework and i think it is much easier to use a calculator <pad>
the first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert <pad>
the author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then <pad>
the only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and <pad>
books keep history alive <pad>
other people can find out about places they might go <pad>
later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the was taught about life by herself and her parents <pad>
so lastly join me and help the world know that computers are good <pad>
secondly internet access allows people to meet new people <pad>
no one could express love the way we do now <pad>
looking for an adventure of your own you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking <pad>

all of these features affected the cyclist in some way <pad>
that any person finds offensive <pad>

if something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them <pad>
the water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more <pad>
she helps homeless teens find places to stay and she is always welcoming <pad>
the rider says the sun was beginning to beat down <pad>
with out any doubt there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread through out the thousands of books and magazines a library holds <pad>
having many different kinds of people sharing this material the libraries must try to have material to please everyone <pad>
from what the author says times at home financially have been tough but because they had such a loving family everything was alright <pad>
not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up <pad>
my second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people <pad>
in this generation more kids are overweight and obese that any other generation <pad>
people can use a webcam aim or email to communicate with other people <pad>
that is what has come down to computers <pad>
this might not even work but its worth a try <pad>
this is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling <pad>
every human being does not have the same taste in what they read listen to look at and watch <pad>
well a friend of mine used to go outside everyday went outside to play <pad>
with all the facts i have given you i hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful nice and safe <pad>
without variety how is that possible <pad>
do you want to learn about the far away places without breaking the bank <pad>
for example a study at showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less <pad>
the mood of the memoir is warm happy and sweet thanks to the author <pad>
this gives you a chance to discover people with the same interest as you <pad>
people are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting off the black market <pad>
history books can be one of those that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised in <pad>
more than that is kids <pad>
they can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school <pad>
but on this one i must say i agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people <pad>
also l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him <pad>
we should just keep them out of the libraries <pad>
why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples <pad>
i wanted to go near them <pad>
for example a student could have a project over <pad>
how do you take it when people come out with magazines movies or music that is extremely offensive to you <pad>
as you can see the internet is a valuable learning tool <pad>
to me censorship laws in libraries are not needed <pad>
though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school
next computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world <pad>
many types of people go to libraries looking for different things <pad>
lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen <pad>
one example of being offensive in a good way is the book <pad>
this makes life a lot simpler <pad>
when you read you learn when you watch a movie you learn even when you listen to music you can learn <pad>
censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read <pad>
we all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs we must prevent censorship and accept all <pad>
so i hope you take my opinion in consideration <pad>
before much technology people used to plant gardens and trees but now that thought hardly crosses our minds <pad>
instead of getting outside and enjoying nature they waste time on computers <pad>
this gives him hope and <pad>
for instance if people are on a lot of the time is research <pad>
i am a very talk person but i know how to talk on line if <pad>
this is going to be my first opinion <pad>
then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience <pad>
in the following i want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries <pad>
we should have an understanding of the bad things in life <pad>
they were all proud and happy with everyone coming together as a family <pad>
this also revolves around addiction <pad>
do activities keep you mind off things <pad>
so if you would please under stand we got to read all of our parents favorite child hood books <pad>
but when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information <pad>
the author creates a feel of happiness and gratefulness throughout the story <pad>
then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her <pad>
they even offered us tea <pad>
but that it is why these books are created for older people to read <pad>
you must go out and enjoy nature <pad>
one day i want to fly a big airplane <pad>

kids think they are immune to getting in trouble while messages or putting up picture of themselves <pad>
some books in libraries offended some people <pad>
since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good <pad>
restrictions on renting that material could be set <pad>
there are ups and downs either way it goes <pad>
this is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries <pad>
this young girl once pure and simple now knew things no one at that age should know <pad>
language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate <pad>
while at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended <pad>
world is far from perfect <pad>
some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home <pad>
they will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books <pad>
if you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button <pad>
lastly when kids miss their favorite shows one day they can just look it up the next day to get caught up
as the cyclist continues for a few more miles hes becoming slowly dehydrated and finally sees a building <pad>
you can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer <pad>
we go to school by bus <pad>
you can learn many things online you can practice math reading and even writing <pad>
replied the book is to <pad>
computers bring no adventures just pictures of them <pad>
everyone has the right to read and write what they want <pad>
there you have it computers use is not a major problem <pad>
just because some people take offense to certain things does not mean that everyone does <pad>
there are a number of windows in the post office <pad>
she believed that it was an inappropriate book for a grader to read <pad>
the made the mood in this memoir a nice feeling story and a story <pad>
the mood in the story is thankful <pad>
but for you who do not get other stuff <pad>
no book should be taken off a shelf for its content <pad>
teenagers should be aloud to watch kid movies and teen movies <pad>
dear local newspaper i think that computers have a good effect on people <pad>
i like reading about anything and everything so i would love to read things and spark my attention <pad>
with all honesty books and novels were made for a reason <pad>
i believe that certain books movies music and magazines should be taken off the shelves to those who they are offending <pad>
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out <pad>
if you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you <pad>
the computer is a major help <pad>
libraries across the world are facing the obstacle of censorship <pad>
an example of this is the school i attend middle school <pad>
and they try to blame it on a book story or show they had seen <pad>
you be doing work or chatting with a friend but your also just sitting their <pad>
there are so many programs to use that making a big presentation could take minutes <pad>
you be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book <pad>
this is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him <pad>
these books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know <pad>
she was really sad she failed <pad>
it has a skin full of fur and a long tail <pad>
we are miles away from our friends and relatives <pad>
statistics show that more than of people on earth use search engine to find something on the computer <pad>
all in all the removal of offensive books magazines movies and songs is harmful to the public and to the libraries themselves <pad>
libraries should be able to have a variety of different books <pad>
computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society <pad>
heart disease is caused by obesity <pad>
there are better alternatives <pad>
you could find one quite easily if you tried <pad>
however there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe <pad>
say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music <pad>
information can be found in any subject <pad>
computers have become a part our everyday life <pad>
i believe that if books magazines movies etc <pad>
they were to type quicker that they could before <pad>
the features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist <pad>
we went inside it was a giant library <pad>
book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed <pad>
believe it or not using a computers is unhealthy and not beneficial in more than one way <pad>
who in the world would say a computer is useless <pad>
the obstacle being a long cropping hill this made the cyclist exhausted as he uses much energy to summer the hell he was <pad>
it made it very difficult for him to finish his ride <pad>
is grateful for what they gave up so cold have a good life <pad>
the author is trying to be positive but its hard because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down <pad>
to simply write a book or a magazine or make a movie just to offend someone or something is wrong <pad>
many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read <pad>
they contain and which give us the energy to work <pad>
that to make a hopeful home <pad>
i was really happy for her and realized computers are helpful <pad>
every work would be remove because at least one person is offended every work of the sort <pad>
these people need to get their families and friends back <pad>
these are the main points from paragraphs and <pad>
if you say good for you <pad>
you can make calls to a person using the computer <pad>
computers can and will take away family and friend time <pad>
people learn from books with happy endings and sad endings and gruesome endings are all able to provide lessons for the reader <pad>
people just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable <pad>
my final reason of why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social <pad>
people interact with people online if the want to <pad>
what is the world going to do <pad>
the cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place <pad>
many times i have seen people have a over an offensive literary work <pad>
even if the others loved what they saw <pad>
this is very convenient <pad>
they might also have to have an adult with them <pad>
many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years or even days of sitting in front of their computer they become lazy
you can learn from the computer <pad>
for example the author wrote over one long crippling hill a building come into view <pad>
i personally can not stand rap music but my sister loves it <pad>
the child started dancing with the <pad>
we can learn about the climate <pad>
my mother kept them carefully in my room <pad>
i actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials <pad>
computers can be good but not for everything in your life <pad>
no one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot day while emailing a friend <pad>
that is why i think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph <pad>
dear editor the source i have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers <pad>
censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools <pad>
you cant hide you kids for ever sooner or later they will find out about these problems <pad>
censorship is the underlying problem to many things <pad>
the paragraph tells how was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she the test again <pad>
many people that do not have computers depend on the library <pad>
yourself from your computer <pad>
people get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months <pad>
wrote a book by the name <pad>
it was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants flowers <pad>
this country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want <pad>
nobody wants something to go against them in anyway <pad>
the first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new <pad>
we come to know about their habits customs and traditions <pad>
this final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing <pad>
a good form of education is the exposure to different types of material <pad>
for example i a book about a teenage girl in sexual relations she became pregnant and it ruined her life <pad>
my first reason i think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places <pad>
there are some weak boys and girls in my class <pad>
then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about <pad>
the internet is very addictive <pad>
in this story the features of the setting the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot <pad>
the faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals <pad>
they should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries <pad>
when you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the <pad>
there is a reason why things are and <pad>
not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance but that is why the goes around <pad>
you can see the <pad>
books could be a way people escape the real world <pad>
kids use the computer in order to do their history projects <pad>
i believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people <pad>
in the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist <pad>
this would eventually remove our freedom <pad>
it used to be that books were read to learn something new or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information <pad>
censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer <pad>
you should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section <pad>
are all great shows for kids <pad>
they are great ways to help learning <pad>
a lot of the at home jobs today require computers and without the computers the job would not be getting done <pad>
the features of the setting in the story do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist in the story in many ways <pad>
people need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever <pad>
like who won the election or who won the sports <pad>
keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn <pad>
i will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game come along <pad>
they start to eat too much and later they become very lazy <pad>
but my opinion on the magazines and movies could vary <pad>
dear local newspaper people spending time on the is a good way for people to connect with one each other <pad>
points are scored by throwing the ball into the basket fixed at each end of the court <pad>
each more mile he keeps telling himself if i can just get there ill be fine <pad>
that means that so many people need to foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it <pad>
has been working overseas for two years in <pad>
many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids <pad>
the author created a mood in the memoir <pad>
they found two boxes in the park <pad>
the author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt <pad>
do you think libraries should have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find it offensive <pad>
another handy program provided by all computer companies is <pad>
even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go i do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point
although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale but censorship is censorship <pad>
he learned a lot and we were all proud <pad>
big are kept all around the library <pad>
now as you can you see computers really can change your life <pad>
it makes him feel hopeful determined alone and completely exhausted <pad>
the library can be compared to a big computer <pad>
some say that our future generations will be greatly of knowledge or become naive because of this lack of knowledge <pad>
you do not know who could get their hands on that movie book or article <pad>
music will always be out there <pad>
dear of the i strongly believe that computers effect us in a positive way <pad>
so you can see why my family does not like computers <pad>
i would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things <pad>
if they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines they should do at home <pad>
obviously computers are beneficial <pad>
computers have none of that <pad>
you meet new people when you are in the computer <pad>
this is the major element that and him in the story <pad>
this technology can help you more than it can hurt you <pad>
we turned around and saw a little boy struggling in the pool <pad>
books are books and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf <pad>

they would get lost and not know how to read a map <pad>
the average day for children in is to go home and going on the computer for hours at a time until a parent comes home <pad>
positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand <pad>
my elder brother is a forest officer <pad>
the authors was very well done <pad>
censorship in libraries can kids in the right direction <pad>
computers is a positive affect for our country because it helps us find information for school and for location were to go <pad>
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness <pad>
no one can stop what is coming you just have to learn to live with it and move on <pad>
kids find these books movies and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books <pad>
movie is but extremely suggestive <pad>
the desert setting with its lack of water shelter and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life <pad>
if you want to know more about different cultures such as <pad>

this tells our children that it is okay to do these things when it is the exact opposite <pad>
other material could just be inappropriate for some to have access to <pad>
censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well <pad>

for example i think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination <pad>
to me the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a family problem than a social problem <pad>
tons of students in have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information <pad>
the man continues his quest to know more about the planets <pad>
he should attend school regularly <pad>
most of these victims do not return or are found <pad>
this means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in and they might not get the pay they deserve <pad>
an example is i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state <pad>
most importantly computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you <pad>
there was no on the way <pad>
was blessed that he had his house <pad>
the amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years <pad>
this supports the mood of the memoir because the author is grateful to his parents for teaching him what a home really is <pad>
obesity is a rising issue in and kids need to exercise <pad>
today thought the number of is somewhat <pad>
after a few years had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father <pad>
so if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it <pad>
the strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect <pad>
i somewhat agree with her however i do believe there should be rules on where books are located <pad>
if students never know how will they live <pad>
they should not be banned though they should only be moved <pad>
taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading <pad>
the towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns and are no help to the author <pad>
these items be offensive to some people and they be too inappropriate for children <pad>
the cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain <pad>
also a lot of people are using the for there businesses <pad>
people under should also be restrained from looking through these materials <pad>
the opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across <pad>
so what is your side on this argument <pad>
they might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it <pad>
computers can be useful and have some benefits on the other hand they are harmful and they should not be used as often <pad>
but on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer <pad>
its all apart of life <pad>
all libraries are broken down in sections <pad>
do not read the book or magazine <pad>
there were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious <pad>
or your daughter from looking at porn <pad>
but if there is something that you do not like just keep going <pad>
the cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of <pad>
what would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you <pad>
the story of is just one example of censorship <pad>
computers can most certainly improve our society <pad>
the cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused <pad>
it takes away your time that you can be going to the going to stores restaurant the things you <pad>
there is no doubt that every child sitting here loves and respects their father and mother <pad>
another reason kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades <pad>
such as family friends or a group of close people <pad>
the of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to <pad>
everybody around has a unique part about themselves and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have <pad>
i wish they would not but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so <pad>
good marks give fruit in the future <pad>
my first reason why i think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet you know what people say you learn something new everyday <pad>
from the very beginning the author describes the home as more of a way of life than a physical space <pad>
because of this even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing <pad>
now lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users <pad>
so when it spring again and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test again because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundings
maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf <pad>
all of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel <pad>
this is due to censorship <pad>
computers give education stand information to everyone <pad>
therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist <pad>
so then i decided the next time i have a project to do it on the internet <pad>
also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high <pad>
if a family wanted to take a vacation they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there <pad>
other like word help you set up writing essays and stories <pad>
your personality also change with your social life and routine <pad>
the winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through <pad>
people deserve to have better and not offensive books <pad>
we need computers they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe <pad>
they stand for these values but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do <pad>
this also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship the mood that the author set during the story was love <pad>
parents stress all the time about where their kids are what they are doing who they are with and so on <pad>
i hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things <pad>
such as staying organized studies and even entertainment <pad>
dear in the world has changed so much for the better <pad>
not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to since they are always on the computer <pad>
i have seen many of my friends get lost in these books and magazines right in front of a adult like there mothers <pad>
once your child finally they will get the to use the computer <pad>
the last thing you can do is become more healthy <pad>
the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our one being <pad>
it shows that she is persistent determined and strong willed <pad>
these advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives <pad>
very hot the water was also degrees <pad>
my second reason is that advance in tech <pad>
your health is at stake <pad>
but shell be a different person also <pad>
in the class very few student were attentive <pad>
should there be censorship in libraries <pad>
therefore no book should be censored no matter how inappropriate the material is <pad>
it can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct
dear newspaper editor i think computer are a benefit to everyone <pad>
what will we begin to for the future <pad>
such as taking a walk and enjoying nature <pad>
this is why the mood of the story is happy <pad>
i think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things <pad>
flowers were blooming <pad>
weather places the will to continue all are reason that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist <pad>
why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen <pad>
take abortion into perspective <pad>
one man stood in front of a resisting to move showing courage and wanting a democracy <pad>
my school has a big library <pad>
parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve <pad>
for other people though the story is much different <pad>
the parent should be able to certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions <pad>
everything is useful and everything has at least some sort of positive effect coming out or it <pad>
this is one way computers benefit all of society <pad>
also it would not matter to me if i walked or drove or rode my bike to the library <pad>
people need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends <pad>
but then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers <pad>
computers have a negative effect on people <pad>
they then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang <pad>
her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing until you thought about it a little more deeply <pad>
the setting he was in made him a little more wise <pad>
i believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things <pad>
for example think about google earth it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world <pad>
come in handy surely you now see that some games are very educational <pad>
prefers not to know where her meat came from <pad>
this is simply a result of bad censorship <pad>
every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with <pad>
with these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games <pad>
you can easily find the details and information you need <pad>
there are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends <pad>
they provide us with valuable research entertainment and cold hard facts <pad>
since all they talk about in the media is sex articles would probably be in the magazines <pad>
he not only makes local calls but also trunk calls and does not think necessary to pay for them <pad>
without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways <pad>
then they are right back in a chair making movements <pad>
computer usage will keep you in the <pad>
a poll even says that of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer <pad>
now due to the wide variety of computer selection a computer is starting at prices as low as sixty dollars <pad>
a second productive task can help us with is learning <pad>
the schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force <pad>
not literally but it feels that way at the time which is what you should feel <pad>
even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer <pad>
but i would have to disagree i think those books deserve to be read <pad>
the features affect the cyclist in a big way <pad>
the mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author <pad>
it is also a great learning technique for research <pad>
what do you prefer having computers or no <pad>
your family can make parties <pad>
jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face <pad>
everybody has their on opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want <pad>
so once the clock turned to i put her to sleep <pad>
should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive <pad>
we as a society do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released <pad>
parents can censor what their kids read if they want <pad>
keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves <pad>
this shows the effect the exposure to heat had on cyclist <pad>
this is second reason <pad>
also you can socialize as well as study with this device <pad>
he is running out of water but has the determination to get to last the terrain affects him <pad>
this shows how much she misses home <pad>
that there means that there is no way to from it <pad>
censorship for those who understand is unacceptable although select items should be viewed under supervision <pad>
also online you can watch movies and listen to music <pad>
this would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot <pad>
it goes along with me in the morning <pad>
lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet <pad>
setting does a lot to influence stories so it is important to keep that in mind when reading <pad>
over vast changes of terrain <pad>
therefore i say the mood of the author in this memoir is happy grateful <pad>
she want her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories <pad>
people can make there own decision of what they want to listen watch or read <pad>
when you grow up you learn to read about the movie and look at the rating <pad>
everyone is going to be offended some point in their life <pad>
so what do you think <pad>
now he is a fashion <pad>
it teaches us everything anything <pad>
i believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways <pad>
about of my class has computers <pad>
since the are just as equal to everyone else <pad>
these that just one grade class most students are addicted to it <pad>
therefore never depend on the internet as a source of research <pad>
it is not right to limit a whole society on what they have public access to because of one opinion <pad>
i hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else <pad>
experts say that with computers at home get only of the exercise without computers get <pad>
this makes the author need more water than he normally would <pad>
they were created for older more mature readers <pad>
the author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test <pad>
when voting on this decision please take part and support advances in technology it will be beneficial to everybody <pad>
maybe she wants to see what lays ahead <pad>
i think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend <pad>
if you use the computer for educational purposes like games you could really learn a lot <pad>
going to the library is such a better solution <pad>
also the mood was good because they came got an apartment and at the end every ones happy because it became their home <pad>
some people connect with books in a way that others not understand <pad>
the fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce <pad>
they say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere <pad>
reading a book is not worth going to jail for <pad>
in conclusion you can see how a computer can effect a person <pad>
next all her thanking shows her being grateful <pad>
no you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework <pad>
learning about new places can help the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation <pad>
the author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and shell be stranger than she was before <pad>
the most popular right now is <pad>
readers want a variety of books music and movies to choose from <pad>
one night she had so much hope like abundance then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home <pad>
the author also shows that she was taught how to do things by her parents and that she was happy that they did that <pad>
as long as there are other readers and people who like those kinds of books and music then they should keep them on the shelf <pad>
i think the last time i spent some time with my family was about weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit <pad>
people were throwing water on the fire <pad>
that includes children <pad>
the most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy
where did this inspiration come from <pad>
you go to a library to read books music and magazines but soon you find out that there are very offensive books <pad>
i disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect <pad>
those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children <pad>
somethings can get in sink too a brain and it could never be helped or solved <pad>
the cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy <pad>
i love him a lot and he is my greatest strength <pad>
you have to act now before its too late and computers have over taken the world <pad>
i believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials <pad>
secondly some music and movies should be banned <pad>
though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries <pad>
this means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated <pad>
find locations to where the live <pad>
they not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have <pad>
if everything was censored we would really have nothing to read or to watch <pad>
there are many reasons for this but one big reason is because they sit in front of computers all day <pad>
dear of my local news paper you believe this garbage that the so called expert are saying about computers <pad>
half of the time the statues are of a naked person <pad>
lastly the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day <pad>
not only has this computer crashed once but twice <pad>
those are the ways that in this memoir the mood is very welcoming <pad>
in conclusion computers have negative effects on society because they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight <pad>
i do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves <pad>
i believe that people should not be able to remove books movies magazines etc <pad>
and the way she talks to her mother <pad>
there are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning <pad>
in the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated <pad>
if your a busy parent with kids you can work online <pad>
they have for legs and a small tail <pad>
its neck and body are covered with bright blue feathers <pad>
he had a big yard for them <pad>
imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library <pad>
seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer <pad>
the camels from have one <pad>
every year more electronics are made and most likely are portable such as phones and etc <pad>
he remains busy the whole day <pad>
for example the search engine is an easy to use website that can be very helpful <pad>
computers are one way of communicating to loved ones in far away places <pad>
the more on their computers the less exercise they get and less fresh air <pad>
the reasons listed above tell you why i believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose <pad>
another is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type <pad>
computers can even help get online so you can exercise your brain there also <pad>
i would have to say yes to that question <pad>
if there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off <pad>
there is no bad effect of computers <pad>
i think computer is a great way to learn and talk with others <pad>
there are many websites that have games you can play <pad>
first off computers give us the ability to talk with people all over the world <pad>
many people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society <pad>
he also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black back <pad>
i agree with those experts because many people take the computer serious and always want to be on <pad>
my thirdly reason is how to search on google or the <pad>
it is much better to interact with people in person face to face <pad>
also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy <pad>
should not be changed is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio
dear newspaper or to whom this article concern <pad>
as i mentioned before when the police officer came to our school he talked about this <pad>
it demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above <pad>
spending time with your family is something precious <pad>
i believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today <pad>
even though computers do have pros and cons they have more pros <pad>
he passes a closed juice factory <pad>
i would hate for some little year old or year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life <pad>
the author shows a feeling of a warm wonderful household with music and cooking <pad>
books are much more accurate <pad>
at first it wont be easy but its worth it in the long run <pad>
instead looking up what a book was about just read it <pad>
libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in <pad>
how do you graph linear equations <pad>
it would be very hard to do that report without a computer <pad>
he admired their courage <pad>
of course its speed was reduced <pad>
i found out how to do it and it worked <pad>
however it has kept kids inside instead on the streets causing trouble <pad>
this time the cyclist says yes sir <pad>
primarily i would like to say that computer are a fantastic source of information <pad>
he barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business <pad>
everyone needs to look at both sides of the story <pad>
there are two who conduct the match <pad>
you can talk to people on or email each other and have a conversation with them <pad>
that is what matters <pad>
books music and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet <pad>
have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer
