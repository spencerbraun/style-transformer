the author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. <pad>
if they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then i know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.
these are some reason why i think we all need computer. <pad>
why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive? <pad>

if you think that amazing then read this. <pad>
the people who spend their day on the computer need to change. <pad>
though these are all valid opinions, they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves. <pad>
why i think we should have computers. <pad>
i really consider leaving computers to what they do best, helping humans. <pad>
now on to more about how computer are good to society. <pad>
it is a very thing to do. <pad>
she uses this plant as a tool for comfort to help her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher.
that is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with. <pad>
but of this will happen if you stay on your computer .
yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of together. <pad>
the practice of censorship is what should truly be banned from the shelves. <pad>
these books should not be aloud to be checked out by kids under the age of unless their parent or guardian allows them to. <pad>
i think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out. <pad>
right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. <pad>
in this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. <pad>
all they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that. <pad>
it will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers. <pad>
that is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. <pad>
you can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead. <pad>
expressing what you think about a certain topic. <pad>
they will most certainly destroy you, readers. <pad>
when the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming. <pad>
they would have never had the chance to make their own opinions. <pad>
they brought love to all people. <pad>
they are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives. <pad>
fake and writings is a small problem to readers, and writers. <pad>
many books have a great educational source for many years. <pad>
no one would be able to read and no one would be able to express themselves freely. <pad>
after all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment. <pad>
offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. <pad>
if you buy a computer your life would be more relaxing. <pad>
while my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. <pad>
i do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. <pad>
to many people other than myself, would agree with that. <pad>
radio stations play songs that talk about sex, drugs and violence but i believe that kids need to be associated with these things. <pad>
however, once again it was very misleading <pad>
on the internet people can find information about faraway places or people. <pad>
in it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. <pad>
censorship can include anything from to language, to news reports. <pad>
the call you names and pick on you and sometimes make you feel <pad>
the author put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after winter, so can the girl. <pad>
exercising helps you grow. <pad>
lastly, the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students. <pad>
her plant was like a representation of a new beginning. <pad>
in libraries should remain the same as it is now. <pad>
nowadays there are social networking sites, like , and , that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away. <pad>
it is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate. <pad>
some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short, rolling hills. <pad>
computers build up your skills for everything. <pad>
without computers this would will be nothing. <pad>
the hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. <pad>
says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. <pad>
he hit a bump and swallowed the stone. <pad>
does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the <pad>
out there, and yes, they are certainly fun and healthy. <pad>
i think there is also an issue with computers. <pad>
if you think about it, there is a law called freedom of speech. <pad>
setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone. <pad>
what you can even do is you can talk to your friends, listen to music, and do homework. <pad>
censorship in libraries results in more problems than <pad>
the weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. <pad>
there are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. <pad>
from this i can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family. <pad>
censorship is trying to shield us from the of this world. <pad>
it makes you think of your own family. <pad>
when people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. <pad>
new music sometimes contains or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. <pad>
the people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. <pad>
most the time that you spend on the computer could be spent outside or at the movies. <pad>
i told you what i thought should go on in the library. <pad>
well, this pattern has been going on for years. <pad>
if your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on that was do in a week, what would you do? <pad>
at this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out. <pad>
in result of this i notice that my brother does not or treat my mother with the respect as he should. <pad>
that is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. <pad>
the question is, should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries? <pad>
i got news for you. <pad>
i enjoyed it. <pad>
computers are great because they allow you to talk online. <pad>
it is emotional because the care and love for each other. <pad>
the first reason i thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there. <pad>
is inappropriate to one person could be deemed to another. <pad>
take my friend she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. <pad>
so, as i ask again, what be offensive in libraries? <pad>
one example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. <pad>
but why do some people not hire them? <pad>
i have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. <pad>
but last sunday was different. <pad>
the cyclists determination went down as long as he was riding. <pad>
you should keep reading essay because i am going to tell you good reasons why i benefit people using computers. <pad>
finally, from what you experienced. <pad>
these are reason why the society should take back the computer. <pad>
he even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others. <pad>
your going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day. <pad>
things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen are in <pad>
books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination. <pad>
plus, many things that are offensive often remind of who we are. <pad>
whole generations of books, music, etc. <pad>
there would be no rented movie stores, or success in the movie production industry. <pad>
if we took out certain books, and music from the library, it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library. <pad>
its up too the too know whats good for them. <pad>
why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to? <pad>
if i had it my way, the would not exist. <pad>
you could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and play over a friends house. <pad>
kids are now staying up later on the in turn lowering grades. <pad>
computers can also have an impact with your vision. <pad>
its pretty much a desert. <pad>
the road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. <pad>
the setting also affected him by his confidence and making him seek out water. <pad>
another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others.
i think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps make learning about other countries easier. <pad>
about the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. <pad>
obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. <pad>
stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. <pad>
in fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. <pad>
while your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. <pad>
the same can be said for merry scenery too. <pad>
therefore i think that computers harm people and effect them in ways they do not realize. <pad>
in this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. <pad>
he is in school from to and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer. <pad>
parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library. <pad>
for example an online game can let you chat make friends, <pad>
but the author was grateful. <pad>
she seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. <pad>
everyone is supposed to get at least minutes of activity daily, but no one ever spends that much time working out. <pad>
i believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight. <pad>
we bought tickets and entered the exhibition grounds. <pad>
i believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers. <pad>
but really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter? <pad>
the internet can be a very good source for students. <pad>
some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. <pad>
many people need time to think about what is happening in their life and they cannot do this our internet. <pad>
when you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn. <pad>
in the , there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. <pad>
if you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. <pad>
the author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. <pad>
she feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. <pad>
so i think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, everyone likes something different. <pad>
many argue that computers provide quick easy communication, help children and adults learn, and even teach habits to our generation. <pad>
if i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato i would but i never go on the computer unless it is for homework.
another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. <pad>
libraries are a place for learning and work. <pad>
they cause addiction, which end up taking over peoples lives. <pad>
if people are always playing games the computers then when they go out for a <pad>
they have to join the other and are again at the end. <pad>
this happens quite often, and i end up staying awake until around .
some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive. <pad>
instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away. <pad>
you just have to know when enough is enough. <pad>
books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. <pad>
also, taking the test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everything is new, and she has overcome her winter. <pad>
it not be the best choice because movies rated let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of .
the mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. <pad>
the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. <pad>
in the progress the computer has put over of single people and expressing the relationship. <pad>
kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it. <pad>
i have that i cannot live without who are strong base who i cant live without talking to for a day. <pad>
we all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. <pad>
it just depends on the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. <pad>
some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family. <pad>
reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like. <pad>
suddenly i felt that i was in the <pad>
other people will allow this chance too. <pad>
now for the big question: should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together? <pad>
a reason why i think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person, not be offensive to another. <pad>
sometimes we get project spend most of them involve <pad>
did you know that of people on sites set ?
here is my conclusion. <pad>
however, personally i feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. <pad>
if you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is in appropriate, ask questions. <pad>
this means that you have to practice more to get better in typing. <pad>
he was worn out because the setting was so <pad>
what we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so. <pad>
i have known who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about all they cant even handle .
not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. <pad>
books are essential part of life. <pad>
it is the first thing that we look for every morning. <pad>
the author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community. <pad>
sometimes they get more than the persons who earn their living by doing hard work for long hours. <pad>
everyone has there own way of writing and there own imagination. <pad>
suddenly it started <pad>
this is said ?? <pad>
the features of the setting in do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist. <pad>
can make a change. <pad>
when a train there is a lot of noise and confusion. <pad>
well you <pad>
all the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. <pad>
why do people find it necessary to do things like that? <pad>
i myself have family in , which is a whole continent away! <pad>
while walking around the i saw boards which warned us not to feed the animals. <pad>
learning about people will help you make friends to. <pad>
a third reason i feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. <pad>
let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world. <pad>
another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. <pad>
dear newspaper, computers does have some cons but they also have a lot of pros. <pad>
in this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving. <pad>
people in can talk with people in .
next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. <pad>
this all happened because he listened to the old guys. <pad>
just another useful effect on people. <pad>
because i only enjoy reading about the <pad>
they help people in any number of ways. <pad>
the water pump there has the flavor of battery acid. <pad>
we all enjoy it, but have different that we enjoy. <pad>
if you hear someones music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. <pad>
in no way, shape, or form is this morally correct. <pad>
they all have different look and ideas. <pad>
flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. <pad>
but now their could be a lot more <pad>
for example, and children can use programs such as (). <pad>
it has a charm of its own. <pad>
for example, one day a few of family friends come over we were eating dinner. <pad>
has no long tail. <pad>
( ) these were the moods the author expressed in the memoir. <pad>
from the experience that i have had with books that cause i have noticed myself not liking the book. <pad>
and that the end of your world comes when you make it so. <pad>
by being able to search anything, help children with homework, and pass the time if you have nothing to do. <pad>
in a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on. <pad>
so many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually <pad>
the talks about his parents to so that he can have a better education. <pad>
people need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends. <pad>
if a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. <pad>
they are having a positive effect on people. <pad>
in the story, a cyclist needs to get to park. <pad>
these are all things you would not like your children to use, see, or do. <pad>
we have today the great in the form of and literature. <pad>
just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad. <pad>
at my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or books all in one place. <pad>
this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character. <pad>
after all who could pass up the opportunity to better prepare yourself for life? <pad>
this contributes to the cyclist sensation for a drink of water. <pad>
shout their at the top of their voices. <pad>
reading, using computers, working at a table. <pad>
the breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. <pad>
because the have a person there looking for they have the computer to look on. <pad>
a philosophic approach towards life will cultivate through <pad>
being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time of interacting with family and friends.
other material that could be offensive could not only be to children, it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well. <pad>
healthy, grateful, and we are slowly losing important. <pad>
i believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. <pad>
what you look and keep the little kid with you in the house. <pad>
i believe this because other people be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent. <pad>
this basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want. <pad>
it is never the parents fault. <pad>
because some books and movies are bad to show little kids. <pad>
lastly, health issues are raising <pad>
thank you for your time, , <pad>
i strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. <pad>
everyday, the teachers would give an update over his computer. <pad>
do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because contains one curse word in the whole book? <pad>
we also use milk to make cheese, and <pad>
by removing the source of all these those acts can be prevented and society begin to the pain for reform. <pad>
they are as important as the heart. <pad>
next, the web is also used for keeping in contact. <pad>
the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. <pad>
was put in the story for a reason. <pad>
they are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. <pad>
there are several things that explain why i think this. <pad>
first and computers allow people to talk to friends and family. <pad>
this brings me to my conclusion. <pad>
this gives off a very happy and cheerful mood. <pad>
where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around .
i do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. <pad>
eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he <pad>

about of all picture on the internet are true. <pad>
overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him. <pad>
have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on ?
the common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please. <pad>
throughout the library, there are many books dealing with past historic events. <pad>
for in the text it says that he staggered into the store. <pad>
go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. <pad>
if interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. <pad>
you can explore nature on the computer. <pad>
now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination. <pad>

i walk on the grass. <pad>
most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. <pad>
from the of to the banning of in the empire. <pad>
i hope that you will take these reasons to heart. <pad>
he held the boy tight and swam to safety. <pad>
i do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. <pad>
whether those reasons are for education or for the libraries have reasons for them. <pad>
about of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. <pad>
the person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them. <pad>
his parents put love, unity, kindness and happiness in their home. <pad>
they should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they grab at the library. <pad>
why pay too much money for spending much time in the computer, when you can turn off the computer and spend some time with your friends.
the author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. <pad>
the mood created by the author in the memoir. <pad>
it because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. <pad>
in conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. <pad>
after the first chapter i had wondered who call this a children book. <pad>
when the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. <pad>
first off, computers can cause major obesity like it has done already. <pad>
do not take the books off the shelf, maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be <pad>
when i grow up and soon get out of high i want to travel all over the world. <pad>
by censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on i think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens. <pad>
these are what you can use to talk to your friends at school. <pad>
in every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it. <pad>
do you remember school projects sitting down bored and watching your stations or sitting in the doctors office waiting bored out of your <pad>
the magic of mutual love will bring boundless joy as love knows no weariness. <pad>
as long as okay to watch or lesson to. <pad>
along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework. <pad>
within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. <pad>
websites can be a way to find computer time. <pad>
nature is a beautiful thing. <pad>
this saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. <pad>
in this case, the authors message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. <pad>
to me that is a mood. <pad>
every day in the morning i clean and oil it. <pad>
this quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. <pad>
my first reason i believe computers are good to have around is. <pad>
the police took a long time to find her after she had been because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of
when you are on a team and exercising you will learn life skills. <pad>
in conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way. <pad>
i think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way. <pad>
when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. <pad>
my mother is a teacher. <pad>
the story is about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change. <pad>
i go to the park. <pad>
magazine companies put pictures of people on the front cover to catch someones attention. <pad>
offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it. <pad>
computers are a wonderful way to talk to other people. <pad>
i obviously think that censorship is a good thing. <pad>
he once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. <pad>
the features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. <pad>
they make rules just to display their power over students, and take away many of their rights. <pad>
these computers can even improve your mood. <pad>

we would be nowhere. <pad>
traveling on is very common. <pad>
many jobs involve the usage of a computer how to use the computer before. <pad>
after reading this essay i hope you will agree with my position. <pad>
in conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. <pad>
that is the question. <pad>
here at we have over computers in use throughout the school day. <pad>
one of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like <pad>
offensive is a relative word. <pad>
please continue on to learn about how we should use the computer. <pad>
also , reading is one of those things that we differ with each other. <pad>
in conclusion, computers are wonderful machines. <pad>
many features of the story effected the mood of the story. <pad>
this shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. <pad>

dear local newspaper, more and more people are using computers there days. <pad>
whether your at your house, or on the go with your you can talk to people all over the world. <pad>
the i think that is because when your computer or breaks you would most likely know what to do to fix it. <pad>
not read or listen to things that can hurt inner feelings <pad>
they have the right and no one can take that right away from them. <pad>
music has become a way for people to express them selves. <pad>
why banned some materials from everyone? <pad>
my first reason i think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. <pad>
items are only offensive to certain people. <pad>
some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy <pad>
dear editor, i have heard that some experts are saying that spend too much time online. <pad>
this truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone. <pad>
the computer allows us to talk to friends or family while they are away or even home. <pad>
plus, computers offer more learning <pad>
books should not be censored, if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it. <pad>
whether teens, kids, or adults are on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers. <pad>

i have a hard time understanding why they do that but i guess they feel they have nothing else better to do. <pad>
this could cause a number of entertainment forms to be eliminated. <pad>
the store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book. <pad>
what is the mood, created by the author in the <pad>
the black and white ' <pad>
they help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. <pad>

some were reading newspapers. <pad>
i would like to thanks all the reader for there time and hope hat you all support me and my ideas. <pad>
if a book is offensive, first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to. <pad>
it was about the .

if you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse. <pad>
the author looks back on all the good times had as a kid. <pad>

also the fact that computers just keep as time goes by. <pad>
if somebody that word it could lead to it happening again. <pad>
it is a gift of the nature. <pad>
getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer. <pad>
censorship occur when censorship decides to remove or showing certain media or content all to the <pad>
a library helps many people of all ages be able to choose whatever they are interested in. <pad>
not just about family and friends, but the world too. <pad>
lastly, the rough road affected the cyclist. <pad>
third, you can learn new exercise, moves or tricks. <pad>
secondly, i disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. <pad>
the author also shows how close their family is. <pad>
parents today are not as in with what their children do as they were in recent years. <pad>
it shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you. <pad>
also, when he says, the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the <pad>
this was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive <pad>
in the beginning she refers to her new home as, walking into another world. <pad>
so now i leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. <pad>
this number is greatly increasing due to poor education lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the .
my suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books. <pad>
some people think that kind of thing is but to others it bother them. <pad>
this will help us all because we want to learn about new things, talk to new people and see new places. <pad>
movies tell different stories such as life stories. <pad>
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. <pad>
but i guess everyone forgot about that. <pad>
and were you can buy the to make them! <pad>
just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them. <pad>
she still talks to the people in high school, but she mostly talks to her older sister. <pad>
though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. <pad>
books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got. <pad>
he also thanks them for his childhood. <pad>

a good form of education is the exposure to different types of material. <pad>
we need to be able to ask someone a quick question. <pad>

the cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. <pad>
taking them off our shelves will only make us a community, i know what your thinking, why not do that? <pad>

my second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. <pad>
tons of students in have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information. <pad>
at the end when the setting is bright so is his mood. <pad>
this, however, does not mean that it should be removed from shelves. <pad>
it is cool and <pad>
if you wanted to help out a country that just had an earthquake or you could look up what you could do to help that country. <pad>
my last reason go on the computer your viruses connected to it. <pad>

i for one completely agree with this quote. <pad>
people in the community have rights to read, hear or watch witch ever type of material they like. <pad>
the only man to live a perfect life was and was in a human body. <pad>

some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working. <pad>
there are many shops where shopkeepers sit inside with their <pad>
in addition, censoring is the correct thing to do. <pad>
empty shelves would be a horrible look. <pad>
children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. <pad>
right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. <pad>
everyone is offended by something. <pad>

if those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it. <pad>
some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves. <pad>
the only way i would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right. <pad>
the author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. <pad>

there should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. <pad>
now the needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. <pad>
many people find this offensive. <pad>
the issue that is going around is computers have good effects on people or bad ones. <pad>

using computers could possibly save your life one day. <pad>
quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the to a different section. <pad>
do you want any thing like that ever to happen to you or your family? <pad>
i think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. <pad>
the computer you can look for information make faster. <pad>
i remember going to the library when i was a kid, and i wanted to check out a movie. <pad>
this can be causes by lack of exercise and <pad>
so you would have to ask for the movie or and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics.

the most important function of the computer is education. <pad>
the cost of production has gone down. <pad>

some people believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away. <pad>
also there were no other so he could not ask for assistance from them. <pad>
of course there are benefits. <pad>

the internet can be useful in everyday life. <pad>
or in rare cases the parents are the cause of it. <pad>
like the basic theory of. <pad>
should be removed from the shelves. <pad>
all i can really say to that is it is their decision. <pad>
kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible, but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves. <pad>
i think computers have a positive effect on people. <pad>
the setting can affect anything. <pad>
do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive? <pad>
also, there were hills. <pad>
however, yes i do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored. <pad>

the mood created by the author in this memoir is <pad>

in conclusion, in opinion it benefit society. <pad>
they build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including & sports. <pad>
reading a book is not worth going to jail for. <pad>
can be used for projects as well. <pad>
for a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind <pad>
most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe. <pad>
the way they make all out to be is horrible. <pad>
they all rely on trees to survive. <pad>
he was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. <pad>
as you can see games, learning and talking are easier to do on the computer. <pad>
there were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure. <pad>
we should all join hands to build a greener and healthier environment. <pad>
what is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. <pad>
clearly in his memoir portrays a happy mood. <pad>
i believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. <pad>
take about minutes to an hour of your day talk to those people you never get to see, do your reach. <pad>
father asked him what he was doing, because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the <pad>

my mother kept them carefully in my room. <pad>

a lot of people need to take breaks off the because computers can do harm. <pad>
the mood created by the author in this memoir is love, and happiness. <pad>
computers have made information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it <pad>
when the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and <pad>
in conclusion, i believe that computers affect on people. <pad>
this should be a wake up call for those who have children. <pad>
and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day this is an example of how he lost courage. <pad>
a house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its and happiness. <pad>
it has become a separate field of study with so many <pad>
if someone just moved from another town or state, this will help them meet new people. <pad>
that is for you to <pad>
many people are affected negatively by computers. <pad>
knows that members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family. <pad>
the fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too.
if they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well. <pad>
so when you go to get something liquid which and faster than it will be hot. <pad>
that is why i see computers as a positively amazing thing. <pad>
his hopes start to drop. <pad>
they can be religion, race, or brought up in a different way. <pad>
many and features affect the cyclist. <pad>
i would say that is pretty <pad>
have you ever wandered about current events in our country or <pad>
then you can study from the computer. <pad>
at the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books. <pad>
she can get better, so that this time she will pass. <pad>
i do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. <pad>
did you really spend your hard earned cash on a of <pad>
in the past year, victim have committed suicide. <pad>
that is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist <pad>
when my grandparents went to school, they had no idea what a computer was. <pad>
censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries. <pad>
surely the effects of computers cant be good. <pad>
this decision is now up to you. <pad>
to get rice the farmers have to the paddy <pad>
you would think that your going to hang out with them later. <pad>
parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching or rated movies. <pad>
this hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read. <pad>
you think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their <pad>
here is my second reason. <pad>
is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated <pad>
it be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves. <pad>
this creates a mood of hardship and rough times. <pad>
i believe that if someone wanted to know more information about something the library or the should be able to provide it for them. <pad>
now, the computer is also profitable. <pad>
he also considers his community family and that really makes you feel at peace inside. <pad>
there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. <pad>
the author was affected in many ways be the conclusion. <pad>
pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex, race, and violence. <pad>
computers are a hundred percent health for you. <pad>
the author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. <pad>
the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. <pad>
having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and <pad>
i want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out. <pad>
not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via or any of the others it is nice to chat. <pad>
the setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. <pad>
so i strayed out of the kid section and other areas of the library. <pad>
you can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do. <pad>
any thing in moderation is okay. <pad>
that is my reasons i think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen. <pad>
also he kept going to abandoned buildings. <pad>
from my own experience, i have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. <pad>
i believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. <pad>
i understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections.
however you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people. <pad>
well, knowing this truth does not stop the victims from getting attracted by this media <pad>
you can play games with people. <pad>
some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make decisions. <pad>
same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library. <pad>
you can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot. <pad>
in the end paragraph she this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. <pad>
this gives you a feeling of the home being warm comfortable and most of all alive. <pad>
i remember the times when i had a project due at school, and i guessed on. <pad>
me as a child a is throwing me off of my homework. <pad>
first of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. <pad>
it deals with the science of information and information. <pad>
how can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and themes. <pad>
the movies are easy to find. <pad>
the drainage system was <pad>
they are who belong to the family of <pad>
should we have censored them? <pad>
if i were the author i would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive. <pad>
computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family. <pad>
now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad. <pad>
lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function. <pad>
my second opinion on computer is that. <pad>
the setting in the story do not exceed posted speed limit reflect upon the cyclist. <pad>
it was my favorite part everyday. <pad>
computers have or websites design to have with research just as the do. <pad>
this shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times.
examinations are held in every school or college. <pad>
computers can help you study, take notes, and helps do your homework. <pad>
i think that computers are becoming an issue. <pad>
keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way. <pad>
the author writes about how this small simple home was very special home to him and also how much it meant to him. <pad>
people have a choice of what they want to buy and <pad>
no matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn <pad>
for example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. <pad>
advances in technology are amazing. <pad>
here is a short example. <pad>
i just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book, novels, etc. <pad>
they deserve more attention than a machine. <pad>
if it is rated then i know that i see some blood, gory scenes, and <pad>
my experience with computers is that they have much information but sometimes it can be too much. <pad>
that answer is yes. <pad>
because the fancy technology will be here till years too come! <pad>
had made us a better world. <pad>
it also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them. <pad>
this kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age. <pad>
which is good because you can use them at your own <pad>
that is why should have internet because you can still go online but have fun outside to. <pad>
lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker. <pad>
without this valuable exercise more people are .
so you can go on the computer and find a place that is closest to you that has the book. <pad>
this is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation, but free of charge. <pad>
i strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out the library. <pad>
games teach us the way to face failure which we come across corner. <pad>
the most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries. <pad>
computers are nice to have, but be careful not to away all of your time on it! <pad>
you are able to talk to people from different countries. <pad>
this just make me want to say do you really want to be that upset about a book. <pad>
another is a connection of her past experiences. <pad>
the computer has everything you want for free. <pad>
is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it. <pad>
a person who works especially with bricks stones and is called a <pad>
you spend hours on the computer or even hours! <pad>
features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way his journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. <pad>
you might be able to see how an household <pad>
i bought a platform ticket and went inside. <pad>
they allow you to do homework that cant be done by hand. <pad>
censoring the content in libraries is wrong. <pad>
in the field, the player is not supposed to dispute the of the captain. <pad>
a rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. <pad>
we put all of our knowledge into them, even hundreds, if not of years ago. <pad>
why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being <pad>
now some people might say that you can read a book on that country, but not everyone has time to sit and read a book. <pad>
offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. <pad>
as a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. <pad>
computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. <pad>
the features of the setting made the cyclists ride longer and harder than he expected. <pad>
she sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before. <pad>
this also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it. <pad>
so when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. <pad>
to conclude, lets keep those books and magazines away from the younger kids. <pad>
in high school we were told by our parents that we should not smoke do drugs or anything like that. <pad>
in seconds there will be thousands of results. <pad>
of the international health <pad>
his ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. <pad>
computers are like <pad>
on the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places, nature, and even people. <pad>
another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. <pad>
with computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. <pad>
they can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. <pad>
it also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from. <pad>
they form a healthy part of our diet. <pad>
censorship is a tough topic to <pad>
my first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers, is the health issue. <pad>
but why should we have to have movies, books and etc censored, cause their little children every where. <pad>
some are <pad>
i can understand why some people want to remove some movies or books from the libraries. <pad>
you my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show of people who do reports, find their facts on the internet. <pad>
how can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another <pad>
anything you need you can find it on the computer. <pad>
have you ever heard of a <pad>
one time i went into the library and i picked out a book about a haunted house. <pad>
not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same. <pad>
books are very important to people and need some entertainment other than television. <pad>
in a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she <pad>
you should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section. <pad>
killing the layer the are much more hurting people. <pad>
the people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen too. <pad>
think about that one. <pad>
a child of years old would not have developed the mature way of think of the book. <pad>
magazines are also a small portion of this conflict. <pad>
he wanted to reach there soon. <pad>
many of these people better understand others, promoting <pad>
many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like it is actually adding time. <pad>
i think computer are one of the most inventions ever. <pad>
i think the mood the author is trying to give is and satisfied, and that he is loved. <pad>
we can easily avoid this by telling every body these known facts. <pad>
i would keep all types of books in my school if i were the principal of my school. <pad>

the mood the author created in the memoir is grateful. <pad>

he tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are. <pad>
when people push aside their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large portion of their life. <pad>
it is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. <pad>
the train arrived. <pad>
in my opinion, although computers help with certain everyday life, i think that it gives one negative effects. <pad>
to me censorship laws in libraries are not needed. <pad>
you guys can talk about a lot of different things. <pad>
the paragraph tells how was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she the test again. <pad>
she is very <pad>
it is a bad thing for little kids. <pad>
even when you are just on the computer. <pad>
however most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. <pad>
finally, it helps your school work. <pad>
there is nothing in print that can not be conveyed in a different communication form. <pad>
for example, .
this section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there. <pad>
the author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. <pad>
the lack of water and slowed him down. <pad>
if we censored all the books that offended people, we would live in a very uneducated world. <pad>
one simple way to prevent this is spending less time in the computer. <pad>
i was looking at the magazine one day and noticed magazines like magazines and many more. <pad>
just like some people be interested in fantasy or <pad>
people talking each other on line is just another way how computers benefit society. <pad>
some people find some offensive subjects interesting. <pad>
you can have its easy and free! <pad>
if we do not then usage will there will be no chat problems and peoples money will get stolen. <pad>
dear editor, name is and i am a year old yet active in reading the daily newspaper. <pad>

i show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. <pad>
books are needed for research. <pad>
it helps us to know the results of our actions. <pad>
have you ever done a report on a far away country? <pad>
another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town. <pad>
millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds. <pad>
once again i would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. <pad>
level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into. <pad>
they spend their pocket money and sweet <pad>
then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. <pad>
how many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries? <pad>
in conclusion i informed you on why i dislike computers. <pad>
do you think that censorship should be <pad>
computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like , and document <pad>
i would just research online or go to another library where i know they will meet my needs. <pad>
and he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. <pad>
thousands of students just like are being just as bad, and if not worse. <pad>
books are usually good things, although they can be very bad. <pad>
even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and is very necessary. <pad>
does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive, then an item should be taken off shelves? <pad>
most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing. <pad>
computers also help your imagination. <pad>
also, computers can make people stop talking to each other <pad>
movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart. <pad>
the music in libraries should be censored. <pad>
books teach us about good things and bad things. <pad>
i would think not. <pad>
because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. <pad>
at this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. <pad>
the internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. <pad>
the author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. <pad>
fact is one hour of exercise is good for your health. <pad>
slavery and the were a horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again. <pad>
this is terrible and should stop going on. <pad>
there are over and there are never fewer than people playing at a time. <pad>
that she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort.
in my opinion i think the computer its a really good way to communicate with your family. <pad>
so much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. <pad>
in addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for attendance and more. <pad>
their material provides research and appropriate entertainment for all ages. <pad>
my second reason is when people have nothing to do. <pad>
this shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist. <pad>
is it worth it to use all that time. <pad>
even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it. <pad>
most, to all, times the takes from the genre. <pad>
so these are all my reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people. <pad>
she means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. <pad>
that is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. <pad>
my advice, computers are terrible. <pad>
he starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he himself to the next town. <pad>
this sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. <pad>
you will need computer skills in various jobs and what better to start than now. <pad>
that he love them anyways even if it is good or bad. <pad>
i eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. <pad>
books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything without a purpose should be thrown away. <pad>
another reason that i would be all for computers is being able to learn things. <pad>
today, the world has turned to a disaster. <pad>
before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. <pad>
would you just stare and wonder if she was <pad>
just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. <pad>
i feel this way being lack of social skills, no exercise, and addicting. <pad>
it was also very hot there. <pad>
but if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. <pad>
i hope you think about this <pad>
computers almost anything possible. <pad>
people need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. <pad>
libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children. <pad>
their should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. <pad>
then there are the movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a of sexual actions.
some computers are used for entertainment. <pad>
i think it is an excellent thing to have. <pad>
if censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy. <pad>
i think these should be a limit on a computer so people spend less time on the computer and more exercising. <pad>
in conclusion, society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people. <pad>
or even just for fun or to learn something new that you never knew before. <pad>
the water runs out and we are now it our conflict. <pad>
people have different opinions what one find extremely offensive another not care or even laugh at it. <pad>
plus websites are filled with and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school <pad>
if this it lead so far, that the libraries would have to be <pad>
chairs were arranged for the parents and other <pad>
all they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. <pad>
what are we hiding from? <pad>
then by far this stuff helps. <pad>
the house was decorated with streamers and <pad>
in the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. <pad>
most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. <pad>
simply try telling other people about better books they can read and movies to watch. <pad>
one more detail about the mood is that he sounds very grateful for what his parents did and the hard choice they had to make about moving to .
and were always willing to share everything they have. <pad>
the author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. <pad>
you never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. <pad>
words do not exist that can describe how amazing those parents are to do what they did. <pad>
travelling has great value. <pad>
the computer can really up your social life. <pad>
the last type of game is the tower <pad>
the cyclists message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that be lying or <pad>
if you need to know something you can just type it in and, <pad>
computers and technology ruin your time with your family. <pad>
without a post office, life would become dull. <pad>
but, it is mostly good. <pad>
we all have our opinions and choices. <pad>
all of these things affect the cyclist. <pad>
if a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. <pad>
he almost on that man and wanted him to throw his <pad>
how do you <pad>
a lot of people have used computers to learn different cultures. <pad>
should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive? <pad>
the loss of books has been seen throughout history. <pad>
it is hard for kids to understand the of life since ever thing is done over the internet now. <pad>
for thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. <pad>
the land seemed to be and him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake. <pad>
make go in the woods and wake around. <pad>
i cursed my <pad>
on the other hand, a poor but healthy man enjoys life better. <pad>
they claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read. <pad>
when really they are the people with more knowledge. <pad>
computers can be used to learn, communicate, and <pad>
unless you want to put one of your love in the hospital do not use the computers. <pad>
my biggest reason is the learning these articles offer. <pad>
it told me was located in .
the book interested them. <pad>
you should go hangout outside. <pad>
your computer must have the right to play it. <pad>
thank you very much for your time and effort that you put in to listen to me. <pad>
i say get read of it all and do everyone a favor <pad>
she thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. <pad>
as a conclusion, wasting your life on the computer is bad and can hurt your life in many ways. <pad>
this part makes you feel warm and happy about family. <pad>
today most business is conducted over the internet or on a computer. <pad>
computers can teach you how to type without even looking at the keyboard. <pad>
nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours. <pad>
now, i pose question to if all was deemed offensive material, what would be left? <pad>
the effects of computers on me are very good. <pad>
like the say, free will. <pad>
were made many days in advance. <pad>
the hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland. <pad>
was ruled by the white people. <pad>
this effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy. <pad>
i think this is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. <pad>
recently you back to your six pack self. <pad>
that was really hard. <pad>
i am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that be shocking to everyone, and find out about <pad>
for example me and my family went on vacation to , and my mom made all the from our computer at home. <pad>
lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. <pad>
the hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. <pad>
this transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story. <pad>
the banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge. <pad>
i think that there are many different few from many different people on books. <pad>
also, there are some programs on the computer where they allow you to talk to other people. <pad>
also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people judge almost every little word offensive then. <pad>
kids use these as entertainment. <pad>
i do not agree on censorship in our world. <pad>
the two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. <pad>
the best learn about it and help. <pad>
everybody is different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. <pad>
tunnel used to be more when were big, but dwindled down once computers with easier to type on came around. <pad>
in the end computers are something we i need in are life because it makes life simpler. <pad>
i think that it benefits us all. <pad>
the author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. <pad>
first of all, going on the internet and search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want. <pad>
many places show and sell offensive material. <pad>
i cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. <pad>
then after he says that it ways he <pad>
in this memoir the mood sounds like a happy one. <pad>
of people use the computer to get information and get it more quickly than reading a book about that specific topic. <pad>
dear readers many people use computers but, not so many people think benefits society. <pad>
the determination to win and be the best even if it you. <pad>
dear local newspaper, are several reason how computers have effect on people. <pad>
later on, he was sent to a bed in the <pad>
when people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. <pad>
most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult. <pad>
dear editor of the , i heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and i just thought i would voice my opinion.
the book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life. <pad>
from educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. <pad>
picking a book or film to from a library is a small choice, but it is our choice to choose what we can handle. <pad>
they teach hand eye coordination, saves trees, and allows people to learn about everything. <pad>
humans especially children, need exercise. <pad>
books give people another way to learn new things. <pad>
and <pad>
they provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts. <pad>
now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on or a newspaper. <pad>
how will someone know what to expect or what to do? <pad>
each feature causing the cyclist to act. <pad>
computers can be useful and have some on the other hand, they are harmful and they should not be used as often. <pad>
some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive. <pad>
they also, allow people to talk to other people online. <pad>
it was my eighth birthday. <pad>
she is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. <pad>
he was given to his parents by the <pad>
when kids say it class rooms they get in trouble. <pad>
saying this, is saying that is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. <pad>
authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of <pad>
children could take that offensive or violent book into action. <pad>
different things are offensive to different people. <pad>
dehydration also can be fatal. <pad>
it also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house. <pad>
shes trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to <pad>
that way, if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check. <pad>

for example i had to research a person my project & all i was type in his name & pages full of information <pad>

another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. <pad>
when its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good about taking the test over again. <pad>

computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication. <pad>
dear newspaper readers, many hours a day do you spend on the computer? <pad>
if we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would <pad>

you should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else. <pad>
his parents later got a because he turned into a totally different person. <pad>
i believe censorship is wrong. <pad>
the author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings of when she wants to past the test. <pad>
adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. <pad>
young minds get corrupted by reading <pad>
i like this because it keeps the bad apples off the self. <pad>
the next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again. <pad>
their effect is the most positive effect on people, ever in my opinion. <pad>
computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. <pad>
to me i would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. <pad>
what about the younger children who like to read? <pad>
also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large snake in the middle of the <pad>
its fast, easy and safe. <pad>
i firmly believe that this is correct. <pad>
the mood created by the author in the memoir was simply love. <pad>
the pointed her towards the flower. <pad>
another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. <pad>
his parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. <pad>
as teen who attends school i know that i would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. <pad>
and then we have no books on the shelf for any of <pad>
the rest of the would be for people to study, and read. <pad>
there from the small we are able that computers are for from addicting. <pad>
everyone loves their father and you? <pad>
to many children take the movies to the extreme and try and act like the actors or and the children end up getting hurt from these actions.
everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. <pad>
in the essay, rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit, the setting had a major impact on the character. <pad>
the more you hid it, the more children will seek it out. <pad>
children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily <pad>
the reason i know the mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. <pad>
in addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. <pad>
having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself.
i am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good. <pad>
censorship goes against everything the western stand for. <pad>
he would dehydrate to the of the desert and heat. <pad>
one person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to it. <pad>
the mood is because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are & how inviting the house was. <pad>
this increase would help many, people with low coordination. <pad>
he also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things. <pad>
in conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead. <pad>
so the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. <pad>
i know i be with email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. <pad>
