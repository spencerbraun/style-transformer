i am not in any way against reading books, rather i am quite on the contrary. <pad>
in the memoir the author creates a mood that is calm and comfortable. <pad>
but too much censorship can become a bad thing. <pad>
therefore, he should prepare notes regularly at home. <pad>
dear local newspaper, have you ever forgot the book you needed for homework? <pad>
i think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library.
the bigger kids like in grades should be able to look at the books because it will be word that have heard before. <pad>
so why should rap be banned just because it talks about drugs, and drinking. <pad>

the author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents. <pad>
and if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be <pad>

computers provide entertainment to people. <pad>
can go to , ask question and get an instant reply. <pad>
knowing you have people who are like family is <pad>
the author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. <pad>
another reason is because the road was very rough. <pad>
she took it with her everywhere she went. <pad>
they go on to say. <pad>
often people come home from work or school just wanting to relax, so the seek comfort from the web. <pad>
censorship is a matter of great contention today. <pad>
so should these materials that open up doors to new minds and feelings such as books, music, magazines, and movies be censored? <pad>
in conclusion computers have a positive effect on people because its helps people learn about cultures, places, and jobs around them. <pad>
you can talk to people long distance. <pad>
your bank account number. <pad>
so what i am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life. <pad>
so it has been here over years it going away. <pad>
have you ever heard of ?
first of all, what i mean by bad things i mean, your child can go on bad websites, talk to strangers, or get <pad>
in our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible .

he regained hope and moved ahead. <pad>
in my years of reading i have read a few books that were <pad>
the people running the business decide to take out older pieces of work that offend younger people in this generation. <pad>
is high deserts. <pad>
should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. <pad>
finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. <pad>
in today many young get <pad>
thank you for your time. <pad>
taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers. <pad>
even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. <pad>
this affected the author making him remember he had no water. <pad>
there could be many ratings , and .
although chat rooms on computer can be useful, they can do also be dangerous. <pad>
lack of records of that period makes a study impossible. <pad>
if your always happy on the computer. <pad>
that also shows she will not forget her old home. <pad>
spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. <pad>
also if you had to look up a person for a school project. <pad>
computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. <pad>
if a child gets addicted to the computer it will affect how he with other and do serious damage to their brain. <pad>
when the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life. <pad>
many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be <pad>
should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive ?
yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. <pad>
it is the people around you causing the offensive news. <pad>
objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. <pad>
if a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. <pad>
this hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and <pad>
to stay on playing games, or searching the web. <pad>
she has built a small nest on the roof outside my room. <pad>
here is my opinion on if i think that those books should be removed or not. <pad>
one of them jumped into the pool. <pad>
i do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. <pad>
they are scared what do they do. <pad>
but the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and <pad>
the children buy toys, and <pad>
one way or another they will find out. <pad>
libraries are a place for learning and work. <pad>
which makes it more entertaining than a book. <pad>
you would be mad at them and wonder why. <pad>
i hope i persuaded you on my position. <pad>
also, you could give him a time limit on too. <pad>
there are springs of water in few places in a desert. <pad>
the question is, do computers have a negative or positive effect on people. <pad>
libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive. <pad>
this light helps us to study at night. <pad>
the main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. <pad>
you work out your arms & your <pad>
though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries. <pad>
i really do not get why you should complain about these things. <pad>
he was very thankful for their giving arms to anyone who needed them and for their warm attitudes and teachings of what family really <pad>
failing hurt her greatly. <pad>
a library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. <pad>
computers do benefit society because they are fun, a source of communication, good for schooling and education, and for work. <pad>
when your at a young age, anything can happen, while your on the computer, even worse things can happen. <pad>
i do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. <pad>
computers are also a huge help on a project school or work some peoples jobs, they are required to use computers. <pad>
some people think that kind of thing is but to others it bother them. <pad>
removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives. <pad>
i like, computers but i am going to say i am against them. <pad>
the setting of a story is the place, and time the story took place. <pad>
mr. peter is very about his food. <pad>
then, the author talks about how their home is always open and welcome to family and friends. <pad>
learning, and the are online job to be online. <pad>
rather than just getting rid of it all together. <pad>
it is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there. <pad>
people on the internet can do anything they want. <pad>
you can drive a person crazy. <pad>
kids always follow what they hear or what they see. <pad>
if a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger <pad>
sit on your back pond and go bird watching. <pad>
on my computer at home. <pad>
computers are and people spend to much time on them instead of having an outdoor experience, exercising, and talk and with their family and friends.
you could not the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show, so there could be no possible abstract art. <pad>
i remember going to the library all the time when i was younger. <pad>
many times in school, students are asked to do a report on a different country. <pad>
so now you can see why i believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. <pad>
there are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. <pad>
do you love to have friends <pad>
then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. <pad>
part this is due to spending too much time on the computer. <pad>
however, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it. <pad>
computers are a great way to get in touch with people. <pad>
censorship is acceptable in some circumstances but what is censored should not be decided by the government. <pad>
also, maybe kids should not have computers but they can get one when they get older. <pad>
if there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future. <pad>
but people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different <pad>
everyone has their own opinion and is mine. <pad>
many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never <pad>
also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. <pad>
also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. <pad>
the mood of love and care is incorporated into the memories of her childhood, beginning from the time she was born. <pad>
i think other wise. <pad>
some students were busy <pad>
there are plenty of books out there and many different authors that the person can choose from. <pad>
all they have to do is hit a button. <pad>
maybe you could even make next about how beneficial and social computers are! <pad>
everyone loves staying on the computer. <pad>
for example, if you we addicted to computers, then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life. <pad>
the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. <pad>
in conclusion, i believe that the children now a days that are exposed to any type of offensive things should know the meaning behind it. <pad>
thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. <pad>
if this continued, we would have no books to read. <pad>
her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. <pad>
as soon as he was about to give up his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now. <pad>
the cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert. <pad>
and what i mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there to. <pad>
the features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. <pad>
we are a middle class family and my home also belongs to the family background. <pad>
in the middle of the market, there is a big medical store. <pad>
winter is not nice, it is cold. <pad>
sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. <pad>
so you can see there many negative effects on a user of a computer. <pad>
therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together. <pad>
this time the cyclist says yes, sir! <pad>
there are the reasons to why i think that people should less time on the internet, and more outdoors. <pad>
there are now several ways to talk to friends, instant and even video <pad>
he becomes when he said that if he were lucky one of the stones would be in his throat. <pad>
for some students, the holidays mean more work. <pad>
something it becomes difficult to walk to the library, not everyone lives in walking distance to one. <pad>
eventually libraries will have nothing left. <pad>
another example is when your on the computer you can listen to music and talk to friends or read. <pad>
i could finish my homework in minutes compared to hours! <pad>
these people get not enough which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. <pad>
i strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them. <pad>
i think a computer would always have a positive affect on people. <pad>
computers all around the world, and going on the computer can open you to the whole world. <pad>
without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily.
others find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very or interesting. <pad>
first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it. <pad>
also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them. <pad>
the computers give people the ability to talk and see people they the would never communicate with anymore. <pad>
students stand in groups and talk. <pad>
he or she should not throw a over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable. <pad>
the bullies call you names and pick on you and sometimes make you feel <pad>
in conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist. <pad>
there are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned. <pad>
everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. <pad>
the main problem is water, or lack there of. <pad>
music can be produced or even or sung in many different ways to get to people. <pad>
to concern: i have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society.
using computers is very time <pad>
would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? <pad>
secondly, computers interfere with family and friends. <pad>
they should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. <pad>
the soldier must be ready to overcome any difficulty. <pad>
i lost about six cousins in the war from where a hit there area. <pad>
would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view? <pad>
what does the parent do when that child brings that book home? <pad>
every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them. <pad>
dear local news paper, computers are powerful machines in our world. <pad>
the author of winter hibiscus decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. <pad>
our society is just going from here. <pad>
they came from neighboring <pad>
this is why i think having a computer is a good things what do you think? <pad>
by taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to <pad>
also it allows people to talk online from far away places. <pad>
with the computer keeping in touch with people in different towns, states, or even is a piece of <pad>
he speaks softly to his patients. <pad>
the tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and just eating you after you died. <pad>
thank you for taking the time to read essay and i hope you can see things way. <pad>
yet, the real question is; about our children? <pad>
most importantly, the use computers is influenced in schools. <pad>
some of these materials be books, magazines, movies, and music. <pad>
no waiting <pad>
those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist. <pad>
often times, the answer to this question is that the situation is too overwhelming. <pad>
what is this world coming to? <pad>
these are picked up by spell check. <pad>
each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest. <pad>
personally in my opinion i have no problem with anything found in libraries today. <pad>
the plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that united states <pad>

his water is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to and die. <pad>
people will spend less time staying active. <pad>

he works very hard from morning till night. <pad>
whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. <pad>
though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful. <pad>
around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did i find a fairy tale of two <pad>
if something is making the people of our lands more than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general. <pad>
newspaper and readers, computers are a very large part of our lives and society. <pad>
he <pad>
this is what i think should happen to books in a library. <pad>
we can talk on the phone at a distance of thousands of <pad>
we want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it. <pad>
the roads bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. <pad>
since they want it more they will find away to do, watch, or listen to what ever it be. <pad>
when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. <pad>
away computers helping our economy is instead of people driving to go pay there bills, they could pay online. <pad>
both books have one thing in common. <pad>
when it was two hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. <pad>
teachers, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like. <pad>
every person over the age of eighteen has the right to read anything they wish. <pad>
the features of the setting affect the cyclist. <pad>
one way is we can find closest on the internet. <pad>
so i him and how i get a response and i fixed my laptop. <pad>
to the editor of the , i am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. <pad>
last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. <pad>
i personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to. <pad>
to censor our libraries is to our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our and world. <pad>
by spending some time we will be able to our lives and also be comfortable. <pad>
books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. <pad>
i over heard two girls talking. <pad>
computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports. <pad>
these books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader. <pad>
he had a covered basket in one hand a been in another. <pad>
if it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. <pad>
without these sites there might be less and more happy ending fairy <pad>
she cried to show her pain, and bought a plant to cheer her up. <pad>
they share them with their <pad>
these are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers. <pad>
therefore computers have positive effects. <pad>
the author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. <pad>
some people were standing in a <pad>
however, we can also improve and learn from them. <pad>
the computer goes beyond just allowing you to talk enables you to connect with people no matter where you are. <pad>
the authors gave the decision to choice between books or items. <pad>
the author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of <pad>
run around or play a bill game, but not on the computer. <pad>
first thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that. <pad>
so i believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. <pad>
to whom it concern, computers are beneficial to society. <pad>
who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just
they effect the cyclists confidence, and hope. <pad>
even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better. <pad>
i am writing this letter to say that i agree with how computers benefit society. <pad>
you get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your <pad>
also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion <pad>
people hear cuss words probably everyday, whether its at school or home. <pad>
as you can see, the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story. <pad>
we need to have rules in libraries. <pad>
for example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the light places. <pad>
i know i do! <pad>
the last thing i would want my children seeing in a is offensive material. <pad>
their career will have gone down the drain because there is no future in offending others. <pad>
well, not only is a job being but you are also exercising i remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay. <pad>
computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their <pad>
are some books, music, movies, and magazines out that are offensive. <pad>
dear to this concern, computers do a whole lot now of days. <pad>
soon fell. <pad>
i believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. <pad>
i had is a to deal with. <pad>
overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning <pad>
the reason i say the computers are helpful is because it helps give direction helping the economy and because you can send messages quickly <pad>
they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and <pad>
all this was caused by the setting he was in. <pad>
the time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. <pad>
the mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author. <pad>
although health is a problem community is a bigger one. <pad>
the setting affects the biker in many ways. <pad>
some people might think that computers are a waste of time. <pad>
he said it was hot and that he was lost. <pad>
music should also remain in libraries because the artist did not put the lyrics in the song to bring the attention to the offensive material. <pad>
or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like, there are many websites for that. <pad>
first, computers are not good for your eyes. <pad>
while you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. <pad>
on the other hand, a poor but healthy man enjoys life better. <pad>
there are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. <pad>
my last argument is that people can talk to anyone using chat sites. <pad>
all of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. <pad>
the setting has a major role for a cyclist. <pad>
but, what are they taking away from us? <pad>
just stay away from it and you will not get offended. <pad>
the author has left her home and moved to another country. <pad>
thank you for your time. <pad>
libraries are a great resource for information all around the world. <pad>
she was so successful. <pad>
they should not be where the kids go and read books or nothing like that. <pad>
you can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. <pad>
on the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression. <pad>
baseball. <pad>
computers are really great sources for whatever you trying to do. <pad>
disturbing covers and titles are throughout the library. <pad>
they should be locked up. <pad>
for example the story was set on a highway set at which the cyclist was only able to do .
another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. <pad>
this is the amazing experience you can get from going outside. <pad>
makes any task difficult because the sun a persons energy. <pad>
books do not kill people. <pad>
every one is either texting someone. <pad>
just a push of a button, and you have immediate communication with someone. <pad>
this shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die. <pad>
they also help things go faster. <pad>
he bears a good character. <pad>
no matter how far away they go. <pad>
if you find it offensive tell them to pick out a new book, new , a new movie, or a new magazine. <pad>
so i hope you take my ideas an consider them an thank you for listening to what i think. <pad>
i strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. <pad>
to his these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. <pad>
i think that we should read about war and witch them because it is a good way to learn our mistake. <pad>
one way is to be respectful to people and people be respectful back. <pad>
another example, say that you lost your voice to a terrible cold. <pad>
i am mature enough to know not to act out on what i read, and i am already aware of most of the things that books present. <pad>
such as taking a walk and enjoying nature? <pad>
the more information you have the better. <pad>
later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path. <pad>
also, it that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up. <pad>
so i realized that i can go on the computer at the library. <pad>
another example is the keyboard, because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them. <pad>
it allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his college. <pad>
they have two large white teeth known as which they use for their protection. <pad>
third, communication are going to be a hole lot with computers. <pad>
now the content of some books are not always appropriate. <pad>
this shows that many children are on a computer too much. <pad>
computers actually help you with sports in a way. <pad>
they just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie. <pad>
dear local newspaper, i strongly believe computers can be bad for society. <pad>
people who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. <pad>
take the books that contain offensive material, or be inappropriate for those younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library. <pad>
so should we keep using computers for the good of our society, or not use computers to exercise more? <pad>
they can either play sports or even take a walk or run. <pad>
when it starts budding, will take the test again. <pad>
kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get <pad>
one of my good friends is a natural and she is probably the i have ever met. <pad>
we all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. <pad>
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. <pad>
that means that so many people need to foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it. <pad>
why put it on the shelves of libraries then? <pad>
i believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. <pad>
the author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. <pad>
if others spent at least a half an hour being outside to some fresh air instead of using a computer most of them would feel a lot better.
so teenagers think, ' if they can do it, so can <pad>
after a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. <pad>
while the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. <pad>
dear , name is and i will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on man kind. <pad>
some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. <pad>
the author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. <pad>
remember computers are easy to use, you can stay connected to friends and you can go to school on them. <pad>
that is how the mood is created by the author. <pad>
what someone might think is somebody else might think is normal. <pad>
what do you think? <pad>
people should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. <pad>
the times we have oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly we attempt to hide now. <pad>
finally people who have computers are probably happy because computers is a good thing to have because you can do everything on it. <pad>
first they allow you to chat with friends they allow you to message anytime you want. <pad>
books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader. <pad>
people have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. <pad>
and some deaths are around by a heart attack. <pad>
the author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus. <pad>
set it up for only your friends to see. <pad>
this is why she concluded the story with a <pad>
most hear curse words before they can even walk. <pad>
computers help people study, learn, and even talk to other people. <pad>
third, where he talks about his neighborhood. <pad>
instead they sit and play games on a computer. <pad>
most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. <pad>
first, people spend less time exercising. <pad>
that is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library <pad>
you can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a agent. <pad>
and because he misses so many days a school year he usually keep bad grades. <pad>
people are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. <pad>
getting information from the computer is very <pad>
censorship be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again.
moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! <pad>
but then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. <pad>
the offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. <pad>
so there for i think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do. <pad>
if you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. <pad>
this final paragraph draws together and all the final paragraph on concluding idea. <pad>
is my neighbor. <pad>
telling myself that if i could make it that far, id be fine. <pad>
if you are sending someone a recipe for example. <pad>

he does not hurt the feelings of others. <pad>
were not thinking about what power teens have with the internet. <pad>
spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. <pad>
this is what my family did on our vacation to and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. <pad>
these social networking allow teens to talk with there friends. <pad>

last reason is i know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier. <pad>
they can also entertain us when we have nothing to do. <pad>
he the reports, and continues to use this method. <pad>
that is their work and they took the time to do it for our <pad>
banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a for the future. <pad>
i know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what i have to say, their will be no doubt that you will agree. <pad>
that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. <pad>
do you see our future now? <pad>
now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. <pad>
they might not want to be around you as much. <pad>
she talks about how her parents helped others of their kind which made her what she is today. <pad>
he needed to find a place with water. <pad>
so, they just agreed to look past them and ignore what is there if it offends them for the people who do not find them offensive. <pad>
as much as she misses her old home, she is <pad>
i do not make fun of books because i know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. <pad>
the internet also is a valuable research tool. <pad>
in a public library, many children, who the books are censored for, are with their parents. <pad>
this means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. <pad>
saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up. <pad>
this i could not imagine. <pad>
and computers do really break because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. <pad>
it be offensive to you but to another person it not be. <pad>
but many would disagree with that. <pad>
some believe that they help us learn, but i just say so do books. <pad>
most people like stuff that is interesting to them and some like other things. <pad>
kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life. <pad>
so, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. <pad>
the setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. <pad>
it just comes to show that, are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on. <pad>
music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do. <pad>
eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were and in time gone for good. <pad>
all you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. <pad>
well i would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. <pad>
but my opinion on the magazines, and movies could <pad>
therefore i believe games are harmful habit to young .
he brought with him the love of cooking. <pad>
that if you want something off the shelf, think about the other people that actually want to use rather than thinking about just you. <pad>
the world is not a perfect place by no means. <pad>
this is just one reason i support computers. <pad>
the final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. <pad>
computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future. <pad>
you please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action. <pad>
life is filled with mixed society and emotions, so not everyone will agree on the same thing. <pad>
the owner heard me. <pad>
try to think how the future would have been if racism, wars, or even an event like the were censored. <pad>
this can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like. <pad>
i think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library. <pad>
she previously had a lot of home missing her grandmother and from her child <pad>
has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is <pad>
the main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness. <pad>
he describes how hard it is growing up in a racist time, and how the real meaning of family is changed through different points of view. <pad>
dear local newspaper, your computer daily can be a waste of your life. <pad>
other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already. <pad>
all this would help to create a good atmosphere in the school. <pad>
second, being on a computer makes you stay inside. <pad>
ah, i love hearing my computer on when i wake up. <pad>
because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was because there was no place where he could get more water. <pad>
the hard being the kitchen. <pad>
even people in perfect condition. <pad>
another reason is that you can communicate online for free. <pad>
the features of the setting affected the cyclist. <pad>
people would take their business elsewhere. <pad>
elephants are very strong and powerful. <pad>
i hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today. <pad>
the thing they have to understand is that children need to grow up. <pad>
since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. <pad>
so if you would please under stand we got to read all of our parents favorite child hood books. <pad>
what if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? <pad>
but if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie.
today every family has a house of their own. <pad>
the mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. <pad>
our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch. <pad>
from books to music our culture us with it. <pad>
well the computer is a great source for learning about these places. <pad>
he almost on that man and wanted him to throw his <pad>
have you <pad>
well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. <pad>
when that is not true do to the fact that computers have. <pad>
most places have what they call late <pad>
that is one thing i do not like about computers. <pad>
that is the mood the author gives off in the memoir. <pad>
is something to help take away stress inside of you. <pad>
dear, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. <pad>
dear of my local newspaper, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. <pad>
what will you <pad>
dear local newspaper, you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study. <pad>
he was exhausted and could not go on without water. <pad>
now please read on for my second reason. <pad>
so i believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive <pad>
riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. <pad>
if there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. <pad>
a poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. <pad>
have good eyes and enjoy nature. <pad>
these changes quickly become a part of our communication and writing. <pad>
first you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are on the keyboard. <pad>
there was always a strong sense of family and the house too. <pad>
of people only use computer to connect with family. <pad>
there are many books over these topics that many people find offensive or just completely <pad>
not only can computers tell people about interesting places, but interesting people. <pad>
the mood created in this memoir is comfort. <pad>
in conclusion i believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive. <pad>
if keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. <pad>
censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. <pad>
he is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth. <pad>
just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does. <pad>
you of course need a to do thank one. <pad>
when the author put in the conclusion, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. <pad>
not traveling outdoors our body an important .
if you had a family member far away, this could be a good way to talk to them. <pad>
i walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. <pad>
so back to would everyone or some take to books, movies, music, <pad>
the authors family in their home people that they considered family, this right here is a mood well a caring mood. <pad>
trust me, i got addicted to a game before. <pad>
spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do, but with computers people to not do that much anymore. <pad>
this way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. <pad>
then i have also seen accounts where people have been changed in a good way because of a book. <pad>
magazines help people keep up with news. <pad>
so i will say again to consider my ideas. <pad>
a censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice. <pad>
music such as rap and the lyrics used in rap are whats making kids do stupid stuff, the music talks about sex, drug usage, and murder. <pad>
be a parent or responsible child if you are against censorship. <pad>
however, the issue changes completely when one considers children. <pad>
there is one, count that, one situation where i feel censorship is necessary. <pad>
she symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past. <pad>
he was looking very <pad>
not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. <pad>
every person is different. <pad>
the problem with censorship is that a could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. <pad>
are maybe really good books. <pad>
the computer are the best system for go online every body use computer. <pad>
they have forget a kind of family feeling among the neighbors. <pad>
they all let you share with all of your friends, and of you needed to, you could chat with far away friends or relatives. <pad>
by using the computer to complete research papers students save hours of through books in the library and money on reading books. <pad>
should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library if found offensive? <pad>
this shows that even large important still use it for work. <pad>
he starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next town. <pad>
also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. <pad>
the mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. <pad>
the parents were happy about what they did and who they loved. <pad>
for example, when shes in the it takes her back to her childhood, it was like walking into another world. <pad>
when people are on the computer they are not on for very long. <pad>
she still talks to the people in high school, but she mostly talks to her older sister. <pad>
many people still like the old tradition of traveling to libraries, and starting the quest for the perfect book. <pad>
we have not even seen half of what media can do <pad>
i remember when i was a little girl i went to the library. <pad>
dehydration took its and he felt <pad>
the author shows sacrifice by showing what the parents had to give up in order for their child to have a better life. <pad>
sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody live that close. <pad>
these experiences teach us to do, as well as teach us not to do. <pad>
fortunately, the bus started again. <pad>
therefore, i believe that computers have a positive effect on people. <pad>
books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. <pad>
the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. <pad>
if everybody is pulling everything off shelves, what would there be to sell or read. <pad>
spending time with your family can be great fun, as i recently discovered. <pad>
next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to because the geese sound familiar.
were you ever given a school project to do, but no book has the information you want? <pad>
the mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be i believe love. <pad>
should be removed from the shelves if they are found <pad>
i hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad? <pad>
he was taken to a private hospital and was admitted, as an emergency case. <pad>
i think they should make a floor people can go to, to hangout and talk. <pad>
i think it should be up to the reader, if they can handle a book or not. <pad>
many things can affect the cyclist. <pad>
the desert just made him want water even more. <pad>
introduced the famous <pad>
movies can reveal whatever they want. <pad>
learning about make them think how that women got pregnant with a child. <pad>
but why do some people think that it is hurting our society. <pad>
so reader these are some ways why people should enjoy computers. <pad>
but in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. <pad>
one way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. <pad>
after reading this if have proven that my should be admired by many people. <pad>
people need technology for a lot of thin have technology to us. <pad>
students take part in various activities. <pad>
everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online. <pad>
i have notices many teens play cool games on the <pad>
not all music or movies are offensive. <pad>
they are also used for several different things like music on your .
the teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. <pad>
we should be kind to each other and speak <pad>
in other peoples eyes you find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences. <pad>
it will start to get <pad>
materials should not be removed from libraries. <pad>
maybe a great song that made you happy, or a movie that made you laugh. <pad>
dear newspaper people, i think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. <pad>
also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. <pad>
the text states, a young pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. <pad>
how is this <pad>
his home was always filled with life & love. <pad>
is a for science and history. <pad>
how do you think the victims felt, they were punished for believing, or doing something different. <pad>
also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home. <pad>
such as the rated movies or books that are inappropriate for young children. <pad>
this does not writers or artist who or more than include explicit content in their works. <pad>
for example, talking on the phone costs money, and why would you money when you could text, chat voice for <pad>
the computer is <pad>
all libraries check out books so the book is under a name. <pad>
this very bad because when your addicted to something, you can go back. <pad>
which is kind of sad if you ask me. <pad>
the geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. <pad>
i can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids <pad>
censorship for books? <pad>
dear editor, i have recently seen on the channel news that you want to know about the. <pad>
not only should censorship be it should be <pad>
so click your mouse on internet and get your email. <pad>
even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship. <pad>
but, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can <pad>
along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and <pad>
they help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. <pad>
dear of society i am writing this letter to you to explain the many benefits towards computers. <pad>
but really if you think about it, its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about. <pad>
a book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention. <pad>
also, the hills of the country roads. <pad>
this means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water.
not to mention you can buy games like of or : for your !
in conclusion, you could see that computers benefit us in many ways. <pad>
another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading. <pad>
arguing just decreases the social time spent. <pad>
for example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the about for a grade. <pad>
while others don' see a problem with it. <pad>
i remember when my friend moved to .
i think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. <pad>
maybe other people like that kind of music or etc. <pad>
she relates the flower and geese to herself. <pad>
students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. <pad>
kids around the country are being and to computers. <pad>
censorship is really and it should not be an issue. <pad>
threats were found online from big websites like , & .
getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. <pad>
it be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way i am. <pad>
there is not a point to it. <pad>
many people become addicted to computers. <pad>
the man started becoming very <pad>
school libraries are a whole different idea. <pad>
that they now go on the computer. <pad>
computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. <pad>
computers are also good for if you want to catch up on any news, or just relax and play some games you can. <pad>
the hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. <pad>
as the debate continued, i myself begin to the subject. <pad>
it might help us make a better future. <pad>
over all, addiction in everything, including computers and a horrible .
in addition books help you get more accurate facts. <pad>
he runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. <pad>
people use books to forget their troubles and take a trip to somewhere outside of themselves. <pad>
it leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about. <pad>
our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away. <pad>
social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. <pad>
stores can show everything they have to offer including store <pad>
what about the , when million were killed because they were .
because people think differently. <pad>
in conclusion, the computer has some good sources. <pad>
the authors speaking very at this point in the story. <pad>
i think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book not mean something to one person but it mean the word to someone else.
i once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the religion. <pad>
having great coordination would mean that person would exceed past anybody who do not use computers. <pad>
you just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely. <pad>
they were nice and friendly. <pad>
when the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books. <pad>
i love to play <pad>
you, newspaper use a computer to type the news. <pad>
having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. <pad>
it has a skin full of fur and a long tail. <pad>
this is why computers are bad. <pad>
sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some in the world today. <pad>
having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes. <pad>
however, there are still people who think that computers do harm. <pad>
i think that computer help many, people in our society. <pad>
the market place is very busy in the evening. <pad>
the average bill per month is .
making the public recommend the book, and it having positive outcome on the press is the best an author can ask for <pad>
computers are too expensive to have to <pad>
the classrooms would be <pad>
people can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books. <pad>
today you can find so many offensive television shows and <pad>
there were also no people around to help him or give him water. <pad>
that is what he or she chose to write <pad>
you would use a computer to get in touch with friends. <pad>
we should try and keep our surroundings clean. <pad>
there is music and magazines too. <pad>
music is a different story. <pad>
second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project a computer help. <pad>
i realized i have been wasting a lot of my math homework time lately with those online distracting game. <pad>
it deals with the techniques of <pad>
such as slavery, the taking over the , and a lot of our world history. <pad>
if a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. <pad>
() i think that people are not spending too much time on the computers because you can do different kinds of activities their. <pad>
there are many way you can get this information. <pad>
the rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. <pad>
also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. <pad>
kids think they are to getting in trouble while posting messages or putting up picture of themselves. <pad>
another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. <pad>
the mood created by the author in the memoir is that he is proud of his family, their and the way he grew up.
many people don’t know that good health brings mental <pad>
every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. <pad>
so much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. <pad>
i found myself next to a man. <pad>
by changing him physically. <pad>
there is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something. <pad>
every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. <pad>
on the to do i when my brother would let me use the play again. <pad>
she feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. <pad>
students stay in and they study also. <pad>
this is a movement that should change the opinion of many, do people spend to much time on computers? <pad>
when it comes down to the choice, you will know just what to do. <pad>
she looked up to see many birds flying and she realized that she has adapted to her life in .
some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life. <pad>
in this article talks about a young man named and how his life was from then and now. <pad>
my opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. <pad>
on the internet the family could find the numbers, the and some information about it. <pad>
each individual has their own opinion of each material. <pad>
if so had done it affect <pad>
libraries contain many different selections of books, music, and magazines. <pad>
sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be <pad>
i almost screamed with excitement when my father showed me huge planes near the <pad>

lastly computers are beneficial to society because they entertain us. <pad>
also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. <pad>
but you must control what you do on them and how much you use them. <pad>
society today has developed a very unhealthy habit, and it is always using the computer. <pad>
do not take thing off the shelve because a couple of students can read or watch it. <pad>
now i love my school. <pad>
everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. <pad>
dear , i have recently learned that the paper has decided to write about computers and how benefit society in .
as humans we are given certain and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press. <pad>
kids them even teens and adults love. <pad>
if that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. <pad>
it would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. <pad>
the author explains of how he felt of his parent that risk everything in order to give him a better future according to paragraph .
a lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time. <pad>
your friend that moved away, you can send her a message and get back in touch. <pad>
i have had many times in the library and was never once or offended. <pad>
the butterfly belongs to the family of <pad>
<pad>
it was at the when i was years old. <pad>
should a book that many people love and be taken off shelves because some families are offended? <pad>
what is wrong to some people be right to others. <pad>
this park is just a short distance from my house. <pad>
another time the author is grateful is in paragraph .
cars also have computers put into them. <pad>
interacting with friends and family is always a .
also he did know where he was go. <pad>
profanity also can change a person by the way people talk and act. <pad>
while computers, are amazing advances in technology they are also very bad for you. <pad>
this is a good idea for all of us. <pad>
but what if i told you that any person could put anything on the internet? <pad>
public media need to be more heavily this includes public libraries, stores, the internet, and .
after reading my letter i hope you agree with me. <pad>
libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. <pad>
in the library, in our little town, up the of the reading movies. <pad>
also how there was always music that was like an endless <pad>
i think that it depends how offensive the materials are, as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves. <pad>
so, blazing fast speed to chatting with distant relatives. <pad>
that is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist. <pad>
i have read many books over the past couple years, and i find that many of the books that i read have proved to be educational to me.
kids not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers. <pad>
many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive. <pad>
he tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. <pad>
said no but i need to talk to you about a book the librarian said she was way ahead of her. <pad>
the world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. <pad>
using computers could possibly save your life one day. <pad>
the book ' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. <pad>
in conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people. <pad>
freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in .
this quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. <pad>
thank you and have a great day. <pad>
in conclusion, people should not be on computer too much because of their health and their privacy and also to be sure not to meet strange people. <pad>
at that time the class teacher of my class came out of the room. <pad>
thus being said, i believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum. <pad>
because of computers, talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away. <pad>
basically, you can search anything on the internet you are on the right website. <pad>
they provide us for building our houses and making furniture. <pad>
since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also <pad>

another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long. <pad>
we all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. <pad>
put these offensive books in libraries then? <pad>
those are the reasons why i benefit people using computers. <pad>
but once you find it, you would need to check the <pad>
teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting. <pad>
students have the right to choose what books they read, as well as the ability to know what they should read. <pad>
that is another to computers. <pad>
computers are a lot easier to help us with school work, than textbooks are. <pad>
some material could be informational about our solar system or about the human body. <pad>
a library is a place of education and learning. <pad>

it is also very <pad>
their are great things to at the local park every day. <pad>
public libraries are, even with the usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn. <pad>
censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. <pad>
those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision. <pad>

they thought it was bad for kids to listen to. <pad>
there is a reason why things are , and .
computers are helpful machines, more the mist are missing out on using a computer. <pad>
i believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. <pad>
some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. <pad>
the libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers. <pad>
in the essay do not exceed posted speed limit, the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. <pad>
simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens. <pad>
this show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. <pad>
it even gave websites on the back of the book. <pad>
in conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. <pad>
i believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. <pad>
now people have color <pad>
this is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation, but free of charge. <pad>
if they are by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf.
the nature and wildlife is much more important. <pad>
also can we please start using normal books instead of online ones. <pad>
second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world.
authors have just as many rights as we do. <pad>
i think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop <pad>
even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist. <pad>
the sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. <pad>

he can say anything to anybody. <pad>
after the wedding the food was <pad>
people should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music. <pad>
whether the music, movies, magazines, etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you. <pad>
censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. <pad>
for example, a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a <pad>
so that is my view on the situation, people should enjoy whatever material they like. <pad>
there were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of .

once the automatic doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section. <pad>
if people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight. <pad>
the path of the planets is known as an <pad>
the features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. <pad>
this is because i do not think children know as much as we do, so it will give them wrong ideas they have taken the wrong way.
the biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically. <pad>
the light it gives is not it’s own. <pad>

they girls end up being sick, and maybe do drugs. <pad>
trying to act better than every cause your to high class to read something like that. <pad>
i urge people to dump and .
those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. <pad>
before computers became popular, people had to work and look for .
on the world wide web you can meet some new people who not live in your state, or country. <pad>
all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey. <pad>
the second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it. <pad>
also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. <pad>
i have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an individual. <pad>
books always have so people can tell if those are too or not. <pad>
once they lose hope they wont try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. <pad>
then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. <pad>

also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig <pad>
in the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist. <pad>
though these are all valid opinions, they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves. <pad>
a parent supposed to help their child grow and learn right from wrong. <pad>
the computer age is here and it is exactly. <pad>
i think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom. <pad>
these books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. <pad>
even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, could be used at the front desk to keep them from the material. <pad>
the hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter. <pad>
the movie and song rating system is a form of censorship i believe to be needed. <pad>
sports teach is to accept both defeat and victory in the same spirit. <pad>
we should be able to read what ever we want. <pad>
in computers are wonderful things. <pad>
that is one reason i think the books should stay on the shelves. <pad>

if a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. <pad>
dear , have many debated on whether computers are good or bad. <pad>
the cyclist comes to the first town but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. <pad>

there are many and songs written about their beauty an innocence. <pad>
they re <pad>
the author was also very grateful to his parents. <pad>
people having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people. <pad>
this is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. <pad>
another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too. <pad>
how would you feel if tons of your personal info got out into the public. <pad>

computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other. <pad>
i also know first hand the of being clean from this harmful drug per say. <pad>
there are always going to be those people who disagree with things. <pad>
so a computer is a good invention. <pad>
if certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now have never have been read. <pad>
the cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers. <pad>
lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. <pad>

since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events. <pad>
however, book plays a major role in the <pad>

next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions. <pad>
if someone to a country that they have they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. <pad>
in addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become less social with friends and other people like parents, teachers, and more. <pad>
by keeping the harsh language, i feel as if people realize how much harder times were. <pad>
he also proven that since people have started schools the success in school grades has gone way up. <pad>
but those books about war are probably books about history. <pad>
as you can see, i agree that computers are a bad idea. <pad>
if libraries still want to keep certain books in they should start an age limit on those books. <pad>
one of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. <pad>
people should not take this censorship ability out of hand. <pad>
also, i think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library. <pad>
you can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do. <pad>
other poets of nature who have impressed me most are <pad>

computers are fun for many different reasons. <pad>
the narrator also said, she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again ).
the narrator has gone through recently many but in the seasons. <pad>
the reason why i think this they provide us with information, allow us to communicate, and provide us with entertainment. <pad>
within moments of the it was already the internet. <pad>
i shall never let myself fall ill again. <pad>
i believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional , the creation of gray areas, and the of classic literature.

children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should <pad>

the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of <pad>

the next day i might learn something in school that i want to search deeper into. <pad>
computers are a tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life. <pad>
sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but in many ways. <pad>
these items be offensive to some people, and they be too inappropriate for children. <pad>

you can search any topic and learn more about it. <pad>
this hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. <pad>
there where many different moods that the author created in the memoir. <pad>
also , the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly. <pad>
they were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf. <pad>
nature, is being ignored , more than ever. <pad>
i often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. <pad>
if you do not like what is being do not read or watch it. <pad>
so in conclusion the computer is a very good place to go read books, and play games. <pad>
heavy metal music, you cannot understand it, but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we <pad>
in my opinion, i believe that computers have a negative effect on people. <pad>
my second reason why i think this is because when your having a party and you need the computer can help you. <pad>
but she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. <pad>
thank you for letter, and i will an article relative to this subject. <pad>
simple as that. <pad>
i believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves in a library. <pad>
his task is very difficult. <pad>
the features of the setting effect the cyclist over period of time. <pad>
for example: breaking in killing people, and high cars. <pad>
my second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other. <pad>
but just because one parent does not want their child to read ' ', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it.
if you have a problem with what your child watches and than limit what your child reads and <pad>
i believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. <pad>
the final reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his hardworking parents. <pad>
they were going to take to a party. <pad>
we do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them. <pad>
they are useful to every one. <pad>
many authors, and directors have stated that this freedom is important for having an enjoyable and creative life. <pad>
the moon is called a as it <pad>
mr. david is a wealthy <pad>
one way was the heat. <pad>
a few months ago i spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours. <pad>
there are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject. <pad>
and use the computer only when you need to. <pad>
the area in which the cyclist was in, had an enormous effect on him emotionally. <pad>
finally, reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for <pad>
yes, the library is mostly used for books and but there are many other things that libraries contain. <pad>
they themselves with work. <pad>
third i believe its a good way to just relax. <pad>
if they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. <pad>
dear , i am a student and i hear that some people think it is good to use computers and others think that its a waist of time.
if the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person. <pad>
there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind. <pad>
they provide knowledge in a and entertainment after a long day out work or school. <pad>
the choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents. <pad>
people these days are becoming more of than leaders like they should be. <pad>
all you will need to task like at a library you need to find a book and talk to people. <pad>
computers make our lives easier. <pad>
so i believe that we can call find a healthy balance computer use. <pad>
communicating with others has always been a great part of our lives. <pad>
you would hop on a computer and check it out. <pad>
what would it be <pad>
everyone in the neighborhood is so he tells us how his mother always leaves the door open for those who welcome her in. <pad>
computers have changed the way we research and finish school works. <pad>
and let me tell you, there is no after that. <pad>
she felt alone and that she would die. <pad>
library check their inventory and notice a book be missing but guess what, by that time its already to late. <pad>
and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book. <pad>
this all happened because she was addicted to a website. <pad>
you do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. <pad>
or other stuff but computers have more good stuff about them they bad things so that? <pad>
also its a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. <pad>
another thing, that is somewhat related to this. <pad>
he ran into a snake which told him that i am getting deeper into the desert. <pad>
music and movies are a different story. <pad>
they love and protect their young ones. <pad>
dear editor, i have read your past article about how computers can take too much time out of some ones life! <pad>
people on computers waste a huge amount of their <pad>
you can learn many things online, you can practice math, reading, and even writing. <pad>
being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive. <pad>
although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. <pad>
until he got courage and slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. <pad>
a number of children in the are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. <pad>
lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. <pad>
if a child has a project for school, they either use the computers or asks their parents. <pad>
letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong <pad>
but she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter. <pad>
you like music, movies, and more? <pad>
he was offended by it cause his grandfather was a <pad>
websites can contain information that working people need. <pad>
there should not be any banning of books. <pad>
so i think we should take them books off the shelf, if people want to read them they can go buy themselves a copy. <pad>
he goes from one street to another to sell his <pad>
then the cultural program started. <pad>
a library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. <pad>
one’s profession cannot be considered as leisure time activity. <pad>
this in turn makes the world <pad>
listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want. <pad>
is happy in that memoir because only memories that was fond of. <pad>
for example when you leave the library the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library. <pad>
this is one reason the computer is a good source. <pad>
well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days. <pad>
lastly, censorship is a <pad>
can you see now why i believe that having computers around is good. <pad>
because of there are poverty and food problems. <pad>
this principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. <pad>
is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age. <pad>
lastly, have you ever wanted to learn about a place faraway from you live or have you ever researched a topic for school? <pad>
computers can be great things. <pad>
a lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come. <pad>
i personally prefer to type than write but that is just me. <pad>
many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos. <pad>
i think this because if you put into context the word test, it could mean many things. <pad>
dear local newspaper, back a couple decades ago, before computers <pad>
they have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. <pad>
yes, the electric bill could be higher, but for a good cause. <pad>
the author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist. <pad>
there is a great rush in the school library. <pad>
the plant and the geese represent symbols to her. <pad>
for so many reasons i have said, and the ones i have not said, they help people learn. <pad>
the libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music. <pad>
one of them is books i hate them with all of my heart. <pad>
the best way is to play lots of education video games. <pad>
also how she is changing her mind about the plant and the fact that even though its not the same, it can still have meaning. <pad>
censorship in libraries should not be <pad>
use programs on the computers to help design what they are going to <pad>
with freedom of the press anyone can write about anything they want. <pad>
the geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time. <pad>
almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor. <pad>
finally, computers also create many to students. <pad>
they can been used to look up information, talk to family and friends music etc. <pad>
i think they should make better songs for kids. <pad>
she bought a plant that reminds her of home. <pad>
for these reasons is why computers do not benefit society. <pad>
children are taking time out of their homework to go on the computer, citizens are gaining weight, and children are being <pad>
these books have in them people having sex and smoking drugs and their language in theses books are <pad>
he is also thank full for his culture. <pad>
first of all, computers are a great source of communication because if you have a long distance relative that lives in then you can talk to them online.
i was working on a long history paper and essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. <pad>
the effect of the story strikes our thoughts so but nowhere the characters their emotions. <pad>
second, you can make online job <pad>
the place where people buy and sell various things is called <pad>
during projects a kid want know everything so a good way to get information is to goes on the computer and search what your looking .
these books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and among many others. <pad>
children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways. <pad>
while playing one obey the <pad>
libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. <pad>
remove a book from a shelf is like decrease from knowledge that could have been known. <pad>
therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries. <pad>
and so your friends notice wonder. <pad>
they came to for him to have a better life. <pad>
there are over students at .
if other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves. <pad>
this will always happen and theirs nothing we can do about it. <pad>
at times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits. <pad>
there are many movies, songs and books in the world that are good. <pad>
in all, i believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library. <pad>
she looks her new country with a different eyes. <pad>
i felt awful for .
you can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special doing the web. <pad>
if you find something offensive, just leave alone. <pad>
just as the geese go south and as the seasons change. <pad>
that shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. <pad>
the variety of subjects in a library such as songs, magazines and everything else in the library is <pad>
then, when done, you can print it, or even send it straight to your teacher. <pad>
this will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read <pad>
and internet access can lead to chaos. <pad>
rainbow is not a real thing but an <pad>
as continues through the passage it says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help. <pad>
for thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. <pad>
dear people that read the news paper and that have that like to play the computer all day more. <pad>
also they will be able to read about what different cultures they have and religions. <pad>
thank you for your time, and i hope you take what i have said into consideration. <pad>
however, computers help in more than just writing papers. <pad>
you have the freedom to pick out the book. <pad>
i know i <pad>
i know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but i think computers have a positive effect on people. <pad>
the libraries and the community have choices to not have a offensive book on the self. <pad>
lastly, it can have you have a higher position at your job. <pad>
while there, you see some advertising for a new book. <pad>
i know this from experience. <pad>
he would be able to see it, grab it, and himself up quicker than before. <pad>
the mood created by the author in the memoir was in a very thankful mood. <pad>
i do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time <pad>
when the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. <pad>
there are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. <pad>
the ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are an art. <pad>
some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. <pad>
after seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. <pad>
first of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. <pad>
street beggars are seen everywhere in our country. <pad>
all i know is, there too many to count adult websites that children from the ages of log on to everyday. <pad>
sometimes it be better to go outside and play but computers do help you learn and communicate with others which are just as important. <pad>
last example is if your teacher says find the book about the and you go to the library but everyone is taken but you have one by tomorrow.
so why fight when the world was meant to be at <pad>
dear local newspaper, i has come to my attention that many of us disagree on weather computers have a negative or positive effect on people. <pad>
as the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well. <pad>
in addition, i happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many <pad>
whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. <pad>
have you ever heard of or ?
all kind of books should be in the library no matter what in my opinion. <pad>
the mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. <pad>
another way computers benefit society is by letting people chat with people all over the over world. <pad>
the materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. <pad>
not saying that we should our technology, but we need to find a way limit it. <pad>
another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine. <pad>
if you also how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt. <pad>
all of these things can give wrong ideas to our children and teenagers. <pad>
the ones that teach us about life and society. <pad>
spring will come, as nothing can stop time. <pad>
so unless you want all those things happening to you, i suggest you spend less those on the computer! <pad>
due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. <pad>
every second of the day their is someone on the internet searching for date that they would have to go to the library to get. <pad>
the population of india has increased at an alarming rate after independence. <pad>
he looks foolish clown but actually he is a skilled artist. <pad>
so you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones. <pad>
another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a at first because hes pretty much dehydrated. <pad>
schools also are teaching us about the computer as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more. <pad>
to talk to our friends or even to talk to other people in the world. <pad>
some parents take offense to a show on the television because they don' believe that is right for their kid to be watching. <pad>
but he is not the only person with this issue. <pad>
it takes material away from people that can be useful. <pad>
at the end of class gets and the grade on turns out to be a .
most importantly, computers ruin many relationships with friends and family. <pad>
as you can see, those are just a few reasons. <pad>
if your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them. <pad>
store things on them, and use them for entertainment. <pad>
music also helps you look into your creativity which means you want to do more things such as dance, sing, or some even start to <pad>
for example, the libraries have information on the history. <pad>
by reading books we can develop an positive mind. <pad>
not in libraries. <pad>
every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. <pad>
she is also that she is going to change her attitude about living in .
writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. <pad>
they also put the news on there website. <pad>
many people have issues with their race or being messed with. <pad>
this will drastically change how we learn about news. <pad>
just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer. <pad>
computers are not family there are not going to make you exercise there going to make you lazy. <pad>
some beggars act as <pad>
for this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. <pad>
people get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. <pad>
start up your computer and get talking. <pad>
you sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. <pad>
new computers now have webcams. <pad>
having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends. <pad>
just think about it! <pad>
it broke everything down into <pad>
every book that has ever been written has effect someone, either in a good way or a bad way. <pad>
instead, moved from one area to a different area. <pad>
a freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the , the idea of this censorship. <pad>
if there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. <pad>
computers are an and new technology. <pad>
they say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and <pad>
from reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us. <pad>
nature is at her best in the morning. <pad>
believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time! <pad>
to each, its own. <pad>
i ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns. <pad>
my first reason is computer teach you hand eye coordination. <pad>
animals in the setting can also be <pad>
so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music <pad>
no child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults. <pad>
for example, some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people. <pad>
seeing those things, i felt as if i had landed in a different world altogether. <pad>
people who stay to close to there technology will be addicted to it and they will start to kill brain <pad>
in addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. <pad>
now a great change has taken place. <pad>
i feel the story is essentially about over coming things. <pad>
a library where works of literature such as , to a , and are not on the shelves awaiting students to into their pages. <pad>
the tall trees against the sky made a beautiful <pad>
that has been taken out of your local library. <pad>
you can also use webcam where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. <pad>
so if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. <pad>
produces only <pad>
people need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them. <pad>
the reader should be on what books they read before doing so. <pad>
this is something that needs to stop because it peoples health, safety and education. <pad>
dear local has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers. <pad>
we bought tickets and entered the grounds. <pad>
computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage to sit around instead of doing standard minutes a day of exercise. <pad>
in conclusion, computer can help you save money and help you learn. <pad>
i also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across. <pad>
finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or <pad>
dear , computers have a very positive effect on people. <pad>
their loyalty to the party is greater than sense of fair play. <pad>
i have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. <pad>
i think that we should not take them out if they are offensive. <pad>
the world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures, and what better way than to talk to them. <pad>
also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement. <pad>
she became and <pad>

these types of snakes are found in <pad>
that quote shows how proud is of his parents because they gave up their families, friends, and careers so that could have a better life in .
the sun was beginning to heat down, not i barely noticed it. <pad>
also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different <pad>

she had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. <pad>
first, it gives and teaches you social skills. <pad>
they live a very difficult life. <pad>
but when he did get to the town that was abandon to. <pad>
so i hope i have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children <pad>
its obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family and leisure activities. <pad>
another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. <pad>
no one can stop them. <pad>
we as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions. <pad>
computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world, a way to increase responsibility, and helpful for education. <pad>
it sells delicious and <pad>
censorship, a very sensitive topic. <pad>
the same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away. <pad>
censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away. <pad>
it is the final and will most likely be remembered by the reader. <pad>
in the memoir the author creates a happy mood. <pad>
all of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it.
also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? <pad>

adults and kids spend to much time on online pages. <pad>
third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family. <pad>

number you can use a computer for research, and number it can tell you directions or give you info. <pad>
people should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be are fiction. <pad>
however, i believe that from this quote even she agrees we in fear what our children read. <pad>
even if your just looking to talk to someone you can easily do that on the internet. <pad>
the things they cannot read are censored. <pad>
people are and less about the environment does to computer. <pad>
