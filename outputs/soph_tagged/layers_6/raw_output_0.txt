the <caps> for example .
then what we will be able to read or listen too ?
this test represents the achievement of adaptation to her new life .
too many lives are effect by <caps> law and literature .
what is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that persons point of view .
and thats <caps> scares me most .
<caps> had fun running and desires with us in the water .
the people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes .
its not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf the you might think its offensive .
we should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed .
the large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers .
those are some that nobody should even produce .
computers also help with ten on how to make things .
i realized that my children will be telling bad jokes .
i went into the class and she was absent so i was a that period .
this would make it hard for dirigibles to dock in the first place .
some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends .
i would hope you read and this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people .
we watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food .
it sounds like an awful experience .
and last get off the computer and go see your family and friends .
those are the reasons i thought the mood set by the author was happiness .
when you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common .
then handed me a pair of and we went <caps> our way .
some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that .
flying too low over the buildings was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and straw for blimps to be used .
it also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted .
sometimes life can feel so cruel .
that would be on the parents plate to deal with .
and you will have no friends .
no water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going <caps> water .
all of us really necessary that three day camping trip <caps> and joking and just being boys .
it <caps> helps people write better and better .
we always have a really good time with it too .
the friend had the nights were they stayed at a relatives or friends lived mostly .
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself .
another example of the setting is when the terrain changed .
i for example have learned so much from .
a magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it .
you use computers to and put together your paper before printing .
they are more of a benefit than a burden .
<caps> ate a couple of fish and slept .
money <month> be the most vital thing in our society right now .
this would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building .
it is about how laughter can cause you to go from passengers empire one moment to being their best friend the next .
<caps> was silent because they were getting why .
i knew i was going to have to be patient .
removing anything from the shelf is not bad .
we were around <num> years old and in <num> through <num> moment .
students use it for studying and making projects look better .
when people are on computers all day they have less time exercising .
she apologized for the wait .
this would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the empire state building .
it made me sad to hear an innocent little <location> talking about things that are way over his head .
one the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is .
movies and books can easily be censored .
the sad obese is that it never happened .
the mood in this memoir from happiness to love .
s he would not be who he is now in days .
my father died when i was thirteen and since then i had resented each new dad my mother attempted to bring into my life .
i could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still .
her parents would never let her read the <organization> books by <person> .
the mood he has set is love and kindness .
try and change what the reader might think about that time .
our pull turned out to be great funniest .
directions are very important .
after i went to church i took pictures with my family and then went to <caps> to take pictures at the <organization> building .
i got half of the stuff i wanted and the other half was house hold things .
<caps> rooms are the main why .
also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family .
i met <person> in the sixth moment <caps> class .
it started to rain and of course it was on outdoor concert .
the cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town .
then <caps> started getting late and i had to get home .
this test meant more to then she just failing .
i was with my mom and my sister <location> .
they <month> also have music that has explicit lyrics on the <caps> .
as the jokes burns it will go on a throughout the body .
this would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty .
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
one kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends .
they gave up everything they had for her .
in my opinion people would be better off without them .
i knew she would hate this book .
there are people that think there kids seeing bad things will make them want to do it .
the libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers .
<caps> of her daughter .
and that was the time i was patient .
the feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways .
we went to the funeral that <date> and when it was all done i sat in <caps> room and only could remember all the laughs we shared .
finally they came out .
<caps> whole life was being down the toilet .
my coach <person> started to talk to everyone that was new to <caps> .
it is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research .
there was a girl name <person> .
the first reason is wind speeds .
when we got in there it was at least <num> to <num> people it showed .
there come a point when things just become too much .
they were arguing about something .
these are all great uses for computers .
my third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising .
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there .
i had what i like to call a <person> who in my father .
at the end of class <caps> gets annoying and the moment on <caps> out to be a <caps> .
this states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the empire state building .
you could write an e-mail talk to them in a considerable .
i try to teach him things every day and when i go over it like <num> times i get kind a mad .
it was unsafe because the dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable .
com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate .
i suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions felt through <caps> body .
the winds also would make just getting to the empire a hazardous job .
i have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer .
family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family .
no one has glued their fingers to it .
this is because she types and information all day long .
i arrived in town <caps> be very .
some <caps> even give computers to kids so they can use it to study .
all of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his <caps> .
so with the computer .
then take a nice walk or stroll in the park .
music is a whole story its self .
when we started to move i got a little happier but still impatient .
i was cold so he offered me a blankets i got him last <caps> .
one <organization> the only ways she can contact her father is through <organization> .
thats understandable but everyone else should not be .
so i decided to stop .
he wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless .
the second problem was the cost to modify the to meet the needs to not stress the framework .
one obstacle was nature .
a lots of children that stay home or do drugs in the street .
so computer have into that .
but my mom said patience will pay off .
computers should be known as our friends .
one of them was air ships flying too low over urban areas is illegal .
i was okay with it though because thats better than nothing .
he is such a and no one ever wants to be around him .
detail some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly .
one of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not .
another example would be slavery .
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents .
a phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients .
many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and i think that is bad .
<caps> offered me a <date> job after my sixth moment year helping him out at work .
they were both supposed be killed and thrown in the ditch .
patience is a good quality .
you also have a lot of fun said <location> .
a fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers .
without advances in technology we <month> have a better and safer earth generations to come .
he would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that .
you know <person> says that over <percent> of people will never go in nature <caps> they get a computer .
makes them feel just maybe not much but better than they were feeling .
in a different area of the library .
the former quote was found in paragraph <num> described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived .
a final obstacle was an already existing law .
personally i love cats more than funniest but <caps> will always be the first .
you can have conversations with all your friends and family .
i believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library the empire state building .
then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night i will never forget that night .
learning about new places can help the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation .
the hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination .
the next mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said yes .
another way i was patient was when my mom and i went to go get my new shoes from <organization> .
my sister wanted a curling machine she got that to .
no worries the person no contact you by a simple email .
the author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country .
the areas heat without any breeze was getting to the character .
thats all that <caps> mother had .
at the same time i believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something .
everyone started laughing again .
the features of the setting affected the cyclist .
so does everyone else .
thats when our day started to be a bit better .
no material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship .
but when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends .
<caps> that is a time that i had a good laugh with more <caps> just one person .
overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life .
reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways .
i personally we were more tired then we thought .
being on the computer too much can harm your brain also .
these were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people .
then they say about <num> cars .
after i got changed i got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it .
i think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want .
<caps> cousin lives in <location> and the only way i can ever talk to him is through a computer .
either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive .
kids should no the limit .
it was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than funniest .
i talk to my friends everyday on the <caps> .
they changed the way people think and how they look at the world .
<person> <caps> for example in the book <caps> its offensive to and one gets killed .
another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
he creates this <caps> by telling the <caps> about how his family took everybody in .
if i could cheer her up <num> id be happy to do so .
also with increased computer time people are not getting outside .
<person> is very grateful throughout the memoir .
this setting a large problem for parents .
i believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves .
the choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child .
another reason is that you can get a lot of information from the computer <caps> are so many websites that provide answers to all your questions .
the mood i think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness .
i was about <num> years old .
i have to wait to go to my aunts .
they will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice .
new <caps> is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town .
i bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job .
or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones .
alcohol is the same way .
this is one way computers benefit all of society .
it takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing .
and when he arrive at the bait shop .
<person> was next for his picture to be taken when the in <location> hands slipped and landed smack on <organization> face .
me than an hour to get there .
every time we think about <caps> we all start laughing <person> making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag .
she yelled out loud go old man the old man went and she flowed him to the store and she asked what was that and my sales that was .
thankfully i had my <caps> so i watched a few and listened to music .
the listeners help are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves .
they need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world .
my final discussion is music .
it should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group <month> be facing .
unfortunately the reality in successfully completing this far reached destination was slim as problems gradually arose .
<percent> of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator .
the very heart of which was the kitchen .
he read five books and only got a half <organization> a page <organization> notes for his assignment .
the only true story that i can remember that involves laughter was about <num> years ago at the beach .
my first thought was that they just got chicken <person> maybe wanted to freak out <person> i .
also it would not matter to me if i walked or drove or rode my bike to the library .
this is the moods created by the author in the memoir .
when were together there is no stopping us .
she started pulling her hair as i stared at her .
but the bad thing was that <person> was still in love with <person> .
the workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large buildings .
when asked <percent> of <num> graders say they use at least twice a week .
another reason why it would not work was violent air currents .
if the balloon wont stay still while it is very unsafe .
that brings us to what happens around <caps> family .
the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
so after just months of dating i met the folks .
he said that what they did was a more courageous thing than he could have ever done .
the setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist .
not all people feel the same way .
as we started moving forward the planes wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off .
some of the reasons i think this is because like in paragraph <num> .
patient is an important <caps> of your life .
some libraries have begun to censor their book selection by removing ones they thought could be offensive .
a time when i was patient was when i was at school .
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation .
also there are many and cons out there on the <caps> .
just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive the empire state building .
thank you for your time .
who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think .
the fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love the you would have with a best friend .
the <caps> family risked everything to help other families .
she actually thought i was information .
the parents of also check on what their child or teenager is reading .
even though we were personally to go even to be .
all they could share with me at the time was that she was being rushed to the hospital .
these obstacles leaves builders faced with challenges to over come .
these are the reason <caps> i think computers have a bad effect on people .
its just wrong having stuff like that can must a lot of people .
it could be anyone .
the hibiscus has censorship her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in <location> .
then i realize i need someone to go with me .
and to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter .
we realized just how stupid wed makes acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other .
little did i know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner .
he said flat road was replaced by short rolling hills .
<caps> we are home .
there are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things .
these are the reasons why i think using computers is a good thing .
someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing cant out any good .
i say this because instead of going outside .
we need to the of social without computer .
when she up in the morning to take us to school she has a bright smile on her face and she never complains .
video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game .
information is vital in our society and keeps us on modern life .
we had to wait for a hour before he came back out of the market .
they would not let me listen to the music i liked .
the mast on the empire state building had too many problems for the <caps> to solve .
computers also do the same thing music .
many times have i been in an awkward adults that i have used laughter to free myself from discomfort .
<caps> grandma let us go the store to buy drinks for that trip .
you can share you want with people you method see .
in this article i am censorship information about this main characters life and his caring parents .
there were many obstacles that the <caps> of the empire state building faced one of them were some parts of the empire state building .
i believe this because every year new and exciting <caps> and websites are created and make life easier .
do not even think about there do not to be .
sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience .
libraries have sections for all ages .
i strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness .
i still got my game .
the <caps> loves his parents because of their sacrifice and love .
many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly .
i was in pure and not laughing was impossible .
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation .
it is your choice to not listen to it .
i collected the eggs .
all relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in awhile .
<caps> a mother of the <organization> .
i think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelfs .
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us .
thank you for being patient .
i also feel that he is a very happy dad for the rest of the memoir .
my parents always kept there arms and doors open for people to get back on there feet the empire state building .
such as a homework hydrogen or just to talk for fun .
because without <caps> there would be no happiness or joy in the world .
and its something that would have to be done .
these things are the reasons computers are good .
he says in the memoir that he is eternally grateful and still has a love of cooking .
i thought of what the words i needed to say to <person> but i was potentially .
this causes him to feel a little as if something happened to him nobody would know about it .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there .
she hated the dentist .
fire and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that i might possibly have for the rest of my life .
people depend on them a lot but same people disagree .
books <person> could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at <caps> .
i do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different .
that night after dinner i found that i wanted to stay instead of going to sleep early to make <caps> come faster .
it has a playful tone with a warm and loving mood .
the people wont like it and they might not want to check it out again or they wont check nothing out .
my parents woke me up the morning we were leaving and i felt so tired .
we laughed and made fire on how tiny i am as well as how much fun it was after i felt a little better .
i could be in the worst of moods and <caps> always knows how to put a smile on my face .
all sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore all the empire state building .
realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as i had thought .
then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries .
i learned that when you really want something or really want to do something the more patient you are the faster it will come .
from my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline .
she was going to make a blanket .
airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas .
say we take everything off the shelves off every store that is offensive in any way to people .
an obvious one is love .
to spend too much time on their computers .
spring is the sign of life and birth or renewal .
people everywhere learn from books .
i race <person> to the <organization> .
now you can use this technology as a tool not a game .
no one stops and thinks about someone else or their family .
i will never forget how my parents turned this house into a home .
starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building .
they are now a important and useful part of jobs people have now .
spending time with your family is something precious .
here comes <caps> walking up the front door which just happened to be where grandma and i were standing .
when students go on the computer they can considerable with friends .
i found that book to be very offensive just because i was looking at it from a modern perspective .
my mother and father came to this country with such libraries .
we did exactly that we tried and we won that second set .
the author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength .
i think that if they do that they might just take some <caps> .
i am so patient i can wait a month just before i go to cedar point .
that is some of the things that can affect the cyclist .
it is so much easier to do that then look for books that has all the facts you need .
but continued to move on .
he wasted just days waiting while i focused on school .
but what i respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor .
i walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway .
one of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible .
they laughed at <person> because she crying .
lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is .
probably also on any teams or in any clubs .
over the <date> i had gone to my <caps> .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways .
some authors <month> do this in a very offensive manner .
then we gathered our things and walked to the game .
the curtains rose and the assembly began .
at the end when the setting is bright so is his mood .
also we laugh at funny things we do .
but the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire state building .
<caps> laughing did have an effect on <caps> mood and attitude .
it is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence .
the should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book .
so there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools the empire state building .
they were stuck a half mile away from the surface .
i think that everyone should have a change of reading any book they want to .
the word has greatly changed .
the final part of the memoir presents great thanks to the authors parents .
there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
you can tell by the way she knew what her gift was .
the sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room .
the night was dark and giving my surroundings a gloomy laughing .
to me she sounds like a brand new person .
computers could even be used for school work .
it seems as if inappropriate materials are found everywhere in todays world .
though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages .
soon enough i found out the doors where locked i was <caps> mad and .
the next most important thing is that kids and adults wont have time to spend time with their families memories with them .
these are the moods the memoir created .
also you cant understand what there saying half the time .
laughs and smiles bounded my world into <organization> and into the world of a few <caps> .
spending too much time on the computer is not healthy .
you never know if someone is a friend or a trying to get you .
this has become a problem .
the most common thing that people do is laugh .
this is an example of hand-eye coordination .
in paragraph <num> the author states the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself .
all the information you could need .
says a local mother as she talks about a computer game .
then on <date> my uncle came over for my family .
then in school i have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over .
i understand that <caps> are wanting to read about famous <caps> and whats new with them .
but when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my <caps> sister was so beautiful .
when i have an essay to do i always use the computer first .
most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety .
we sent the guitar <caps> for a new one about <date> i got another guitar a so i though opened it up .
one day he says to me because of i want to work with computers .
everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf .
<caps> i sat up straight and looked at him .
just out of just <caps> use the computer daily .
i also love video games .
the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame .
love is shown in this excerpt <caps> how grateful he is for his parents and how he feels about then .
another way that computers help todays society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic .
nature was also an obstacle that builders <caps> .
another huge obstacle in particular to allow dirigibles to dock was the law .
this is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test .
last <date> my friend on a business trip the was for <num> weeks she missed him a lot <caps> mom let <caps> she was able to would have a .
to be part of something so special was an honor .
another reason was because of the winds .
someones health is very important now .
all of these <caps> can us research projects many other <caps> .
so we our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done .
the winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building .
not only is <caps> fun but <caps> is also a very healthy thing to do .
i do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech .
they were to type <percent> quicker that they could before .
<caps> because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel .
one comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red in her well water .
i asked why he was doing that and i thought their response was hilarious .
they say that they are censoring what i need for the assignment because it is events and scary for some of the other readers .
during the <date> dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future .
is not offensive the whole way through .
this is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even forth .
obese is offensive and offensive is obese .
the loving atmosphere was created by how much the family really did love each other .
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting effect the cyclist .
take my advice and buy a <caps> .
another word would be being patient .
my final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer .
but if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it .
<caps> forgets that <caps> has one of his own .
they saved us a spot in line .
laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another .
<person> feeling that way made <location> and i feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up .
because also every one likes the same thing .
i get up and walk to the .
one book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is the <caps> of <organization> .
also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off .
i missed her like crazy .
why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your .
she is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there .
i would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine .
more than <percent> <date> that is kids .
<caps> had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for <location> .
but things were said to one another .
<caps> shows his gratitude for his parents moved to <location> .
you could in their ear all day about <caps> responsible to do this and <caps> do this .
this way you can make arrangements .
this law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building .
then they seemed you to do activities and .
however the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the <caps> side .
libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed .
the reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as terrain .
please read on to finish reading my letter .
secondly computers help people learn new things .
the author is showing how the time he is in are taking a toll on him .
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself .
if the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed .
i would do it on the computers if i miss it .
it gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see .
i loaded the track to .
the lesson was about <num> minutes and he was patient the entire process .
another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information .
many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team .
another example is in paragraph <num> it says it was here i learned the real definition of family .
it had the <caps> word in there a lot .
when we get to the first stop everyone gets out with joy even me .
why cant they just allow the materials in our libraries .
then yes he did come right back .
the plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building which would allow dirigibles to dock .
the day before just <caps> i got all my things ready for that day .
teacher said you have tell tomorrow .
this started a very large then war with every one fail winds else .
you could probably call it a <organization> if you wanted to .
maybe it was the fact that i was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the dogs thing in the world to me .
you <month> think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did .
in conclusion you live a happier life when explore the .
then you also have exactly the same right .
where he felt secure and cared for .
my mum is someone who is patient .
i myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother .
the winds would cause constantly shifting from air current .
sometimes i lose my patience when something take too long .
the features of the desert like land were fierce .
some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view .
happy because even though it was a new country the came with a purpose and are living it with their culture which is past down family to family .
this sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime .
i think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves .
bullying can lead to suicide .
also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature .
the memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving .
without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or text message .
i told her no and we got in the line .
its great that kids have a place to go in there free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read .
they are only down by three .
when one book is taken down it only brings other ones into hydrogen .
the film and television rely on ratings displayed at typing times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence content into pieces .
its that one value in life we can cherish forever .
this problem was discovered when the u .
<caps> the would make him become thirsty .
so i hope you understand and agree with my reasons .
that applies to everything that could contain offensive material .
that is how harmful words get changed into names and then the next thing peers are calling other peers that word .
i would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things .
people should have a amount of time of <num> minutes each day and then get some exercise .
they also have web sites you could go on just to play them .
there are ways people can avoid seeing them .
he did not try to make his team be better than they were he just had them try their <caps> and see what the end result was .
children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library .
considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast .
the boys are making pizza if you wanted to know .
we were to our warm up lap and then stretch as a team .
it is not illegal for a library to have a rated <caps> movie .
a study done by <organization> shows that bad the <percent> of kids go on their computer when they cant be outside .
the author explained how the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose .
people call these buildings libraries .
my first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world .
it is better to see and understand than to enter the world need and dumb ?
it would be like having someone take out a word in the <organization> .
one feature is the hot weather and area he is in .
libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building .
she i college for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home .
watching videos or a friends .
she was upset and afraid that her mother was going to be angry with her that she started to shake .
we met through <caps> lessons at our local dance .
getting join are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it .
this was a huge achievement for the <organization> .
it was like a river down my face .
then when we got off the train i said `` .
computers help people around the world to connect with other people computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world .
i suggest that you will agree on my opinion .
libraries should not censor the materials good display .
their would be arguments of what to remove and what not to .
<caps> screamed as his fell off .
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us .
another big safety issue was nature itself .
sixteen minutes go by and still nothing .
the library of the roads adds on to the hills .
they serve almost the same .
i strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer .
<caps> mom was ready to explode .
an that means <percent> of the people wont have jobs .
with this law taking its action it made it illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks .
i always keep sending words wrong .
with four kids it is bound to happen .
the cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert .
its an escape for them from everyday life .
together we can make a change or find a cure .
not <caps> kids have ways to find out what their going to be in live .
but it is true the opposite way as well .
there was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building .
i remember going to the library all the time when i was younger .
if a reader a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material .
you always have the choice to go outside and take a walk .
fresh air clear your mind .
a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame .
there are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life .
you <month> start off on a bad day then you could come home at the end of the day and walk into your house to your child laughing .
all my waiting would be over .
that is how the <caps> sets the tone for this story .
till i found out what she was doing i lost most of my trust with her .
i also think its caring because he understood what was going on .
we would immediately burst into laughter when one of us would say something that could be considered even the slightest bit funny .
mooring dirigibles would lead weights was out of the hydrogen because they were a danger to pedestrians .
addiction to computers is also a very negative impact .
he or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book .
by the time we were all heading to the <location> to fly back to <location> everyone was hanging out and there was no conflict .
thank you for taking you time to read this letter .
its always important to stay fit and healthy .
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home .
sixth moment is a big mile stone in everyones <caps> .
you could be helping your family or friends out but instead playing computer games .
if we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf .
the mood is very warm and welcoming .
i believe this because at one point in time my older brother and i did not get along very well .
the greatest obstacle was nature .
i heard my friends calling my name and following me down the lot but i kept walking .
the builders of the empire state building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there .
the wind was also a problem .
but i am going to tell you about a time i had to be patient at an airport .
we just stared at him .
finally there is no water around .
i am now an for <organization> .
this cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature .
a book also read <month> as well never have been written .
little by little she started gaining weight .
some kids can choose to use the computers but at the same time interesting .
my first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture .
my grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the <date> .
it was my two little brothers of course .
i think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs .
just out of <percent> of kids agree with <caps> science teacher <person> .
then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding .
this allows the student to get credit for their work .
in the mooring mast many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building .
the people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay <num> or more children on electricity .
me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclists mood towards the rider .
for example lets say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow .
the library is a sacrificed to the offensive advanced .
i started smiling and laughing because i was so happy that he could .
many people have in their computers that send you on your schedule .
computers are good for last minute situations .
people can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals .
simple house into a home .
if <caps> yourself in front of a lot of people <caps> need to laugh it off .
then you realize you guys grow kinda you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets awkward .
many obstacles were taken while trying to get the empire state building to allow dirigibles to dock there .
this means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills .
computers do not benefit society today .
in conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful .
the whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous .
there were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced .
when anyone talked she would burn a whole in there with her eyes .
censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing .
the setting affect the cyclist in many ways .
always stick in your gut .
i believe censorship is a great thing for <caps> youth .
and she is making the very best of the censorship situation .
that is why i think more people should use computers .
i waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally i leaned over and handed <person> my note .
so people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now the empire state building .
i believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons .
parents need to be <caps> for their kids .
guess what the libraries have some of these compact of these artists that are played on this radio station .
so we started over and i helped him more and was very patient with him .
if the reading materials are already in the classroom they should not be removed .
we were for warmth .
the features of the setting affect the cyclists attitude towards the old men .
everyone should have a choice and a right to see or <caps> to see certain material they might find offensive .
she pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable .
the conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him .
the features of the setting is affecting the cyclist .
the sooner of be better or for the worst .
<caps> is why i think there should be or rules .
it was there choice to pick it up and read it .
well over it did they shut down the concert .
so why would you remove valuable information .
being visitors inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do .
those the meaning of patience <caps> was a time i was being patience .
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone .
and it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends .
otherwise i would be very bored .
the world cannot afford to censor .
they all are there for a reason .
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice .
i could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which .
make the change today .
and started to rap him up .
offensive or also we have the write to publish and promote it the empire state building .
the book will make the kids think thats the right thing to do if they are able to check it out .
we all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time .
for music theres different types also .
we are all looking at each other thinking <caps> to do .
some book that get removed of insult a group of people because it related in some way to them .
libraries should have books that will help you increase your as well as educate you .
having an talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books .
after the paper work we had to wait another week because they had to fix him .
first place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party should store .
when pulled up to <organization> <person> and i ran out of the bus screaming as loud as we could .
like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad .
so we were songs until our waiter .
while looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past .
with computers a business in <location> or somewhere else in <location> can be connected with a building in <location> .
my friends mother had enough and had to kick him out .
my mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister .
personally i know that i go to <date> camp every year and make new friends .
we were just ending up in fights all the time and for no reason fighting just seemed to find us all the time .
the builders of the empire state building faced difficult time and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new empire state building to accompany this new means .
but if one person complained and the book is no longer there does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on .
whenever <person> was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and i would always be there for her .
all of these obstacles made docking a dirigible here impossible .
he is also very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice .
i had one hour to finish it .
<person> and <organization> moved in together and started a family .
this indicates a happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents love and sacrifice helped the road to his future .
you cant wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe .
it to me that they all offend be happy together .
we should not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our faces .
but it would also must people if you took books off the shelf .
after school i waited in the parking lot for close to just minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up .
i once spent <num> hours on my computer on <caps> .
one of the problems was that most dirigibles were <num> ft long and it would be to much .
so take movies for example .
financial loss is something that many people are concerned about .
this way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter .
the determination to win and be the best even if it takes you .
in some grades at school there is a special various program that helps improve various skills .
there are many educational websites that people can go to learn about any subject want .
you cant agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while .
all because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas .
the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced were nature and safety .
the first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the height they are already at .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness .
i like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans .
one reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of <caps> .
individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe .
knowing that i wont see him in a long time is unbearable .
there are many forms of music .
spending time in nature is that particular persons .
computers are a great way to explore .
students have mom after project after essay and its a lot of work .
my brother <person> jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump .
i think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week .
on a computer you can also learn about and famous people .
but if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff .
there once again he is thanking his parents .
i walk into her room an shes sitting their in a chair .
it is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water .
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home .
here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines .
i was laughing so hard i got a brain censor .
when its bright out again and things start looking out again and things looking good shell feel good about taking the test over again .
it was the dogs thing <person> had ever seen .
this reminds me of the time when a massive earth hit <location> and its citizens .
he is so grateful of his neighbors and how they all came together .
computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and weather <caps> and the can be fun too .
when i answer the phone half of the time <caps> tries to see if ill fall for one of his little tricks .
website text is not the anything provides information far eager showed <caps> also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic .
it made no cyclist to them if i trailed a few feet behind like some complain puppy .
<caps> was just as if we had taken up the life of a teen straight out of the movies .
he is going to yell at <caps> pretty soon .
the sun was shining like theres no tomorrow .
it is funny how even hearing someones laugh can give you feelings for them .
i knew we were going to be here a while that point forward .
i nervously asked <caps> .
winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash to the mast .
the architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times .
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles .
if somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then its their loss .
he barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him .
computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people .
it was <date> when my family and i went to cedar point .
and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term .
also if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer .
some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf .
i believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want .
sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination .
the computer provides websites giving information on every time you could think of .
you could pick a book up learn about it and how to deal with it .
that is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups .
computers show these advances greatly .
the first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could with hold the stress of the dirigibles load .
they also added a observation deck and more passengers were able to wait for the dirigible .
i think about why we laugh in general .
patient means to wait and wait without whining .
when she sees the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus .
another way to speak to friends or family is a website called <caps> .
the mood created by the author is respectful .
he is looking back on his childhood and the memories .
a video camera used on your computer .
theres games you can play to keep you second during the day .
you have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive .
virtual are becoming more and more common today .
even if that could get the dirigibles went down the back would be flying around .
well i am about to write a persuasive essay merely what i think is best for younger children to be reading .
this shows the authors gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and libraries for coming over to <location> to give him a better future .
its really not that hard .
a controversial issue in todays society are peoples conflicting views on censorship in libraries .
thats going to be a hard work to do .
to boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves .
a dad does not get scared .
a time when i was patient was when i was at my dads office .
<caps> a stated earlier computers many problems in <location> social lives .
i was so happy too .
i deal with it and put up with all of this though .
<caps> middle school student .
this shows joy because they are all together .
the teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them .
we were so excited and happy .
we wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort .
there are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist .
and that is the mood of the memoir .
a whole new feeling overcame the room .
people sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen .
the mood in the story is happy .
<person> and i looked at mom and said wow moms like i know .
it was time for the second assembly and everything was going to be again .
when we got home mom told us we had to clean .
the author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change .
you just need to get used to their surroundings .
my older sister <organization> i jumped in line <organization> began to wait .
it is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it .
instead of <date> we thought we could pick him up on <date> .
then one day <organization> parents had decided that they wanted <caps> take a trip <caps> the lake and go .
the builders of the empire state building have a lot on their plate in order to allow dirigibles to dock their .
some material have sex and violence that is offensive .
<caps> and my cousin <person> and my cousin <person> who lived right next to <caps> would always ride bike .
you might end up being lonely .
the answer is never .
those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with the empire state building .
until this day we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time .
every one has such a great attitudes .
there are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist .
but computers can teach you so much more than just different countries .
mood is a feeling displayed to the reader through literature .
this would cause a safety hazard for pedestrians on the street .
we asked <caps> what he wanted to do .
and i could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to .
to us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next .
in conclusion i temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply .
you cant protect your children from offensive material .
the <date> of school was fun .
we were in her moms room playing with this huge exercise ball .
the <caps> books were block because they had and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it .
computers are very helpful in todays world .
to her the geese symbolize her life in life in <location> and how she has became to it .
we all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you .
it seemed as <caps> everyone from our town of five thousand was the game .
the setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways .
the snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey .
laughter <caps> knows that laughter is a medicine .
my third reason is finding out <location> things .
for one the empire state building peoples structure cant handle its weight .
the people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family .
in conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best .
it out of there we were so patient .
she was calling people to stand by the door to get ready to go to their next class .
my parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him .
the main subject which is the focus of the stories my <caps> about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table .
the final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document .
everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight .
they even attempt to try it before they gave up .
it gives people a good education .
i was told i was going to have two new sisters named <person> and <caps> .
he also says how he is thankful for how his parents came to the <location> to give their children a better life .
remember its not only fun .
i went into <caps> room and <caps> little black phone from the therefore you .
my mom was giving me all the steps on before starting the truck .
<caps> last reason is i know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier .
in conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen .
people would like to learn about different things .
they can help learn about a location they wish to travel to .
the mood that was created by the author is loving .
where i was extremely patient .
<caps> my cell phone in my pocket .
in the horrible just degree heat the narrator down his water bottles at such a rate that forest at risk of running out .
so i started to look into joining the <caps> team .
i will now get into more detail on these three topics .
computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster .
this would inform the reader more on what he is about to in for the next week or so .
finally we came to the front of the line .
but it is <caps> and <caps> because they his parents had him and they had a house feel like a home to him .
the <caps> was today .
the wind was unpredictable and swung the balloon around .
this shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are .
i was waiting patiently for my mom .
also computers are able to be used in business keeping when a business has to talk with another from different locations .
it could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet .
all computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it .
she bought herself a flower to cheer herself up .
it was on this perfect day that my friendship with <organization> was founded .
to me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments .
this is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for <caps> their parents do for them .
the lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store .
a last example would be in paragraph <num> when the author describes the safety hazards .
my second reason would be education .
i think that it is a persons own personal decision dealing with which they go to .
<caps> a day where there are no books in the school library .
laughter is a sign of good relationships .
for example the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
one day me and my brother went hunting at <caps> .
in our society today there is always going to be something that someone with or dislikes .
the last time in the story <caps> the regard they <caps> will always remember her homeland the top of the empire state last .
laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day .
people should learn how to deal with different struggles in life .
there was one <caps> in life when i was patient .
every wall was filled with endless color .
so had to come right back in the house .
most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset .
one rainy afternoon on a <date> my little brothers friends mum called and needed me to babysit .
the cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with his name written over them .
well i have been there .
the final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law .
i even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all i got for an answer was a because .
finally the computers can teach hand-eye coordination .
as you can see i need my computer for many things .
many of the experiences were with people spoke different languages or young children who i was able to connect with through laughter .
computers have a positive effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit this <date> .
we turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a bush .
can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime .
when i was in what i believe to be the sixth moment i went to <organization> .
without all the useful information i found on the computer .
she was <caps> neat and clean that she got .
he wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream .
just as my friend and i were in the car .
i had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door .
thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books .
it also is to show she is adapting to her new home .
so <caps> got out of the and walked about a <num> of a mile to the ticket booth .
so many uses for the computer .
do the same for us .
after they rocks a new for the building the conflict of safety came into play .
but as second road sign appeared he was relieved .
the author makes it so that you want to be <caps> and being able to smell the good food .
i believe that the book or magazine or <caps> should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it .
i had asked my mom and my dad if i could get it .
one these and such really helps you in sports .
the simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books .
a specific situation happened when i was about nine years old .
there is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there .
all in all censorship in the libraries should be a read but to only the books worth keeping not these books all in the book .
on our way home we danced around in the and sang to all of the songs that we knew .
computer says computers are information in a compact <caps> out of <caps> people use the computer learn about far away places .
by growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need .
it including right and the offensive .
another reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can <caps> us communicate with our friends and family .
going over all those hills can really tire someone out .
the biggest obstacle was nature itself .
everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests opinions .
i was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small looking girl took a seat beside me .
should be taken off the shelf because .
there was a long line to <caps> the tickets .
for example i read a very famous book called the <caps> of <person> by <person> .
not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments .
i was working on one thing and she was working on another .
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced were comprehended to late .
an their admiration for their strength and perseverance .
the censored everything inside the <caps> .
this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them .
there was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
i shared it with my mom who laughed very hard .
if people want to view those kind of things that other people find offensive they should buy them on their own time .
one obstacle was they had to make sure that the dirigibles could dock safely .
one way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books .
if you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination .
those four hours of be spent with their families .
that is what can happen when buying something off of the <caps> .
so in the other words the computer is useful for students .
this is the mood the author creates in this memoir .
she knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home .
one of the greatest obstacle was because of safety .
all of the flowers reminded her home country .
this place <month> have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down .
i set my down so that i could look for my daily .
an do our laundry like it was nothing .
but <caps> of this will happen if you stay on your computer <num> .
but if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem .
i thing that the <caps> should have all type of books in there because thats what a <caps> is for .
which means they would have to waste even more money .
he would listen and care as if it was his problem also .
and bubbles loves and with his duck buddies and with me in the calm <date> grass .
the wind at times of be too powerful .
thats what makes everyone special .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way .
just try to understand what there trying to say to you .
i really hope you will consider writing this article .
also your bills will get higher .
at <organization> they help with homework and projects .
so honestly it cant be that bad .
so all of the just start fighting .
laughter is a important part of life .
they also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face its needs .
i have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids .
he was pretty nice and very .
that book would be taken away from all schools in the <location> brings us to this problem .
this is a story of a time i was of a time i was patient .
another problem was nature .
that indicates a new beginning or starting over .
this shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking .
that being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date offensive about it made the cyclist .
so i immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think .
this quote only grab a few of his problems .
high school and i was feeling pretty confident .
it took four days to get down there .
as a kid we look up to our parents .
age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material .
if a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned .
computers keep people from exercising so their affect on people is negative .
as for me i am fine .
we walked and talked and he took pictures of everything .
i believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive .
lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge .
during the <date> my family and i went to <location> for a couple weeks .
were happy together <person> told me <caps> we lay on his bed .
in the end of the story winter hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement .
it was the first day of year .
the builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast .
if you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school .
<organization> opened the <caps> and <caps> dad was not in there .
my teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much money i got .
we should teach people about them .
it should not be a big deal on what there about .
i get him in about <num> seconds .
in rough <caps> ahead the features of the setting and the cyclists surroundings greatly influence him .
after being patient it really pays off .
if they are found offensive to the public .
thats when we all started laughing .
i think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy .
it brings us closer .
the author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test .
computers can be used to interact with another .
he could do it again .
i needed a first period class and the only thing open was to .
if you want to be on the computer instead of going outside thats your choice .
books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written .
the memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories .
i feel that trees have feelings like us but cant talk with out a mouth .
the <caps> to make this landing would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station .
the plans were difficult the blimps and <caps> could crash and the mast height was too high .
the setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up .
that affects a lot of people <date> because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer .
hearing <person> laugh again made me feel better about things because i knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her <caps> leaving .
the thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful .
if you have a computer you will have video games .
because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life .
i once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad survive teenage drivers .
i learned a lesson from <time> of to always scope out the area first before you go through it .
exercise is important <caps> people let that .
computers can help everyone connect with anyone <caps> you can see computers have so many positive effects on people .
we go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh .
this time i knew it was a real love kiss .
one <person> had asked if we were okay .
these are the items that teach us new things everyday .
<caps> was her second time going and i have been for about three years now .
when we got to <location> we also to the constantly school to see my sister .
the architects and engineers of the empire state building consulted with the experts .
over the next few months i waited patiently .
recently on the news i saw a of how at <organization> they are using to make surgery more efficient .
every girl for themselves .
happiness was showed in many different ways .
and when spring arrives and its still standing she can go take the test .
you bear of people using computers to do work all of the time .
this line describes the mood as extremely loving and touching because he is showing how much love he to his parents for the life he lived .
i have lots of stories of when i have maid people laugh .
i just think the memoir sets a happy mood .
in both of those classes we sit next to each other though .
also the of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging .
there were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles .
<person> was ready to go home but <person> was determined to propose to her so he checked her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set .
i did not know <caps> was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little my grandma has in the backyard .
a day went by and still nothing .
parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games .
how its filled with love and culture .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change .
this would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast .
dear local i understand that computers are becoming more of a must have in peoples everyday life .
this site was .
to my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all .
computers are the devils tools .
but i feel that we can find a balance between the two views .
it was of me <caps> <person> .
some offensive things are part of <caps> and shows how things progressed from back then to now .
we were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had .
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area .
some books in libraries offended some people .
the story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him .
one percent <organization> the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most <organization> the time .
just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone wont like it .
also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for <num> to <num> year nobody and on up .
so thats the time i was patient with my little brothers and sisters .
i personally think that reading is better <date> sitting on the couch and watching mind <caps> .
this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful .
he could really call it home .
there is no way to express my gratitude shows that forest just so thankful there is not way to even express it .
the setting affects the biker in many ways .
that was the game .
we got our ticket and a map then we decided what ride we wanted to go on .
the computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites .
know matter what you are always be patient .
when they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one .
well if not then when you are not busy you should try it .
you can go on a website that has videos and short about what has been going on and learn about current events .
finally the biker faced his long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water .
another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story .
this is a story about what patience means to me .
then i had to just walk around doing nothing .
this is how i was patient .
everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books .
the purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no other stuff .
i felt depressed for the longest time .
she makes lots of random sounds .
if they do not like the book or movie then suggest to other peoples family not to read it or have them read it and see their reaction .
you could favorite websites to your so you can go to it any time you want to .
we ended up staying there for a week or so in this little that we took with us .
the architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium .
movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes .
this made me very unhealthy i gained nine pounds in one week .
<caps> mom and brother were out late .
my first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it can be educational .
my mom is very busy .
here another reason why from the story .
dear newspaper <caps> my name is <person> and i am a student that <organization> .
i started laughing because i thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back .
this creates a loving and family mood .
we went to the <organization> for children .
now lets talk about something .
these are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful .
she said and that was the <date> thing she said to me until we reached our destination .
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a existing law .
laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons .
another obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen .
the song <organization> by the <caps> was playing in the back ground .
all of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive .
and had the flavor of battery acid .
some people do not agree that computers are good .
i am able to understand how thirsty he is .
i complained again .
later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the empire state building .
it makes them happy .
so i was patient playing in my room with all my toys .
most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out .
this once again made me feel sad and depressed .
in this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving .
then probably on his way to his destination .
computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to no .
with this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support .
<caps> appreciates that his parents to the united states so <caps> can have a better life .
people will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer .
people view offensive writing and actions differently from one another .
i got to the before many of the other students were in line .
she will take the test again .
i do not really understand that .
my <caps> came to the door first to us .
you can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live .
my voice was shaky and i was about to have a heart attack from and from surprise at <caps> said .
we followed <caps> sister to the ride .
that was a time i was very patient the empire state building .
let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil .
even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff .
the parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun .
they sacrificed their laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in <location> to give their children more opportunity .
this all happened because he listened to the old guys .
<caps> i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life .
he said it was hot and that he was lost .
there should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history .
if a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area many people could have been killed .
when you use a computer to communicate you are also saving money .
it also benefits society because in a couple years everything will be computers .
i was dying to go on it .
another bad feature is the endless amount of him towns and spoiled water .
we got there in time to see the guys come out of the locker room .
he always has been the one who can always turn my frown upside down .
the last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships cant fly too low over urban areas .
music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves .
one of my examples of why i disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone .
i cant imagine completing any assignment without computer on my .
another obstacle that the architects faced was safety .
i paused for a long time .
<percent> of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends .
laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life .
now when <caps> tries out .
we as <caps> take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a <caps> .
my kept saying <caps> you will be able to go out .
like he said in the memoir i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home .
that way you could finish your story in time .
trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time .
<person> was her name and she drove a bright orange <organization> .
there are also things parents can do to drivers that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive .
this makes the author need more water than he normally would .
when a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like .
i would go on the computer and get all the information i need .
he says family had nothing to do with being a blood relative .
censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own .
the cyclist also was traveling on road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved .
i always give it my all when i feel like that .
laughter is needed in life to make it more .
after the first couple minutes of class i had found that the rumors were true .
there are three reasons why they should have censorship .
she to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is .
they were full <caps> and she wanted to bake something traditional for them .
forth are forth they offend have technology .
so i did not get that book i just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong .
i do it why cant you .
far from the reach where kids and children are able to access .
this can be directly associated with the of personal computers .
when allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles .
but laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better .
these are the three reasons why i think the effects of the computer are bad .
computers have websites such as <caps> and <caps> which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework .
every year more people become impatient .
in all relationships laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handle .
the author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there .
this would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the empire state building .
you have all these things you .
i was one of the last people off our bus which means i was one of the last to order .
it all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in .
<caps> you for letting me know that .
the variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular .
also in there houses they have music going on all the time .
i had never talked to this boy but there was something very about him .
i could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here .
because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water .
well thats what i got for using the <caps> for offensive .
this shows the authors love for culinary skills .
since your eyes are already bad you might think well they cant get any worse .
you <month> be thinking that we just do it for fun and that its enjoyable and nothing wrong with it .
computers are a good thing because you could email your family or friends any time you want too .
thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her .
mood means the overall atmosphere of the authors words .
that was a time where i had to be very patient .
i am most patient during tests .
going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy .
thats why people should use the computers .
i had missed about an of the game already .
it also allowed to see how full and good his was to .
there was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything .
you can make a cyclist in the way people feel about computers .
i was also very dry and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was .
my third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer .
the variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to calling and prove that they are essential for this generation .
that was the only time i was patient of learning .
the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways .
<caps> he always say hello to everyone in company with his big laugh .
the law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area .
so when i see him running all over the place it makes me laugh .
there are just big reasons .
i was finally their i ordered my tiny when i was done it was worth the wait .
i believe that computers have a effect on people .
i had a very peculiar flavor with berries in it .
one obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars to the worth of modifications for the buildings framework .
thats almost everyone .
people were waiting for their flight to <location> .
later that day my <caps> and i were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway .
when the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain .
a time i was patient at <organization> .
cant is causing obesity in <location> them computer .
my younger sister warmed up to him first .
<caps> i thought her cloth need changing .
i also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about .
we kept telling ourselves that we would it but we never got to it .
those book <month> also have bad language in them to .
in the story <person> always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile .
one reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination .
one example was in paragraph <num> .
most people would be offended and complain .
<caps> took a little while but <caps> was my turn next .
this is a very topic .
each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive .
the bus drivers hurried their way to the <caps> .
it was dead silent .
everything that was on <caps> was not as bad in my opinion .
its just easier to live with it .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong .
i think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some to be created .
i would let them know how i felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner .
computers give kids so much offensive about things they would not be able to do or go in real life .
i said before laughing again .
all the facts of life and the world are put into it .
most dirigibles <caps> using highly flammable gases such as hydrogen .
it used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the of young women .
a family that i have been close to my whole life had moved to <location> due to jobs .
during this was many sports games have come out for the computer .
playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer .
the right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom .
in conclusion i informed you on why i dislike computers .
the flower makes her happy and reminds her of home .
in the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other .
i just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest .
foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with .
she cub her keys and we hurried into the car .
not all laughter is not funny .
i asked my dad <caps> i could use the computer .
then also the thing i can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because i always want to do something every second .
i got news for you .
they thought that she should not listen to <caps> because the lyrics in the songs were too sad for her to hear .
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
with computer you can look up available homes and apartments .
for example if i wanted to i could talk to someone and the <caps> and clean my room .
you should be with your family and friends .
television is basically the same for movies .
laughter brought me to a good place in life .
just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life .
thats how i feel about censorship in a library .
it was around lunch time and i was watching out the window while eating cold pizza .
then as i walked onto the field they all grew a smile .
<caps> i know i said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this .
patient so he walked in and took a number and got his paper from the woman .
the authors mood that he wanted you to feel was that your family and house was loving .
books can be helpful on when it was made .
you have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library .
no matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff there is always a way for them to see it .
hes excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path .
the mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood .
a majority of peoples time is spent on the computer .
i remove the previously stated graphic romance novels .
i remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books .
this was going to be a long car ride .
it keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn .
they are both rated differently on levels of age .
looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set control .
then <person> though to herself i got to be patient .
you can find this all out on the computer .
when he see the first he is overwhelmed with relief and the terrain out again .
but all she noticed was my hysterical laughing .
her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her drivers test again in the spring .
a generally obstacle they were facing was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you .
censorship causes people to become which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it <caps> wrong .
we were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because thats were the boys will be hanging out and sleeping .
and how important he learned that family and friends are .
this features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and more doubt into his mind .
the funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were .
books and magazines are two fun things people love to read .
while using a computer you can <caps> many things .
i jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen .
the author is just showing that the girl is going to try again next time .
this factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state .
she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images .
<caps> this law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get to close to the area .
i turned even to see the coming down .
the mood of this memoir is that <person> is happy being with his family because he believes you should always love your family .
my grandmother shared a memory about when i was <location> learning to read .
now the lunch line .
being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day i learned my lesson .
one problem was actually docking the zeppelins or dirigibles .
the main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer .
that made us realize that we were a lot alike .
this quote shows how the girl was getting use to the united states .
filled the air mixing with the of the kitchen .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building .
winds at the top of the building were also dangerous .
in conclusion compare use be encouraged .
some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer .
those are some of the obstacle the builder faced .
also the dirigible are highly flammable because the used hydrogen rather than helium .
in reality the architects were need to the potential problems of the mast .
with a computer everyone can learn about people all over .
going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books .
the geese come back .
i looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply i expected .
i would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe looking someone out there would listen and care and understand .
this is what my life felt like when the world turned around and i found out my best friend just her car .
one accident and tons of lives would be at .
along with the students in the room .
in the story he says the bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water .
i had watched girls stuff shells into there suits before .
we could always rely on <caps> for an cannot .
we would sit there and watch the whole during while stick on our stressful lives .
then in <location> next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason .
i firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive .
sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them .
in this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland .
also the horrible was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on .
laughter is much more than an emotion .
the heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride .
instead of going to the library and hoping that theres a book on him .
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too .
each parent has different values and standards for their child .
everyday we have choices .
laughter is what id like to call a <caps> of <caps> .
first off <caps> is a major concern many blimps were filled with hydrogen which is extremely explosive .
many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands .
because we are all the same .
then i saw that <caps> from three of my classes .
patience is also about waiting .
he arrived at the first town which was a ghost town .
the fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone .
the builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles them from safely thousand-foot this buildings .
everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive .
i was starting and i just and i passing just in the first half .
it was a thousand everyday and it was putting stress on the buildings frame .
i yelled for my big brother who was playing his game .
they could what there for three hours and not be herd .
getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable .
taking media off the shelves is not needed .
second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature .
computers can the history of place not us .
but most of the time i sleep .
the author includes it to the story theme of missed to change .
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice .
in the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and it .
one of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter .
taking away computers would drastically impact every day life .
you also read about new subjects and learn new things on computers possibly helping you in your classes or .
we were being very patient .
we all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess .
language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate .
the mooring mast on the empire state building was intentionally built for dirigible docking .
computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family .
later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on <person> face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result .
he believed uses that he can be alive .
me and him meet only once a year .
i went and got them water .
<person> sat for two hours .
so the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite .
there are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir .
even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial .
laying there teenagers hated whispers here it comes .
were starting to .
this would make the docking station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire .
the next lunch i went with her feeling nervous the entire time .
thats the order they go in from size and how hard it is to <person> them .
they put <money> of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building .
he said that he would never forget his parent that turned this simple house into a home .
the setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist .
the third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible .
yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself .
this session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us .
you see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them .
the dirigible could <caps> over pedestrians the streets meaning it was not safe at all .
although technology is giant computers are only the .
he was censorship back roads that are abandoned now .
laughter is a huge part of anyones life .
thats why they should not watch it .
i looked at the contact .
i said that i did not know how much it is .
the computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed .
magazines in my opinion should be censored .
like for example rap music .
thats <caps> different place .
i also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from .
my boyfriend and i met about three years ago .
i sat there with tears in my eyes .
computers are a waste of money .
friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives .
if a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual by the law they have the right to do so .
restrictions on renting that material could be set .
the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars .
everyone needs to hear it because <caps> true .
cant should be blocked from the public .
offensive of suicide is also something i think should be available .
this memoir is all about heritage and the home .
i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult shows .
they went around the at least five times before he caught up to her .
memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test .
and very generous because her parents moved for her education .
the fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the empire state building was not drive by nature .
students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work .
my mother did it big for my birthday party .
however thats what his parents did .
the terrain during the cyclists journey greatly affects him .
he had people at his house for second .
the mood created by the author is touching .
magazines are a great tool to bring and talk about some present topics happening around the world .
i was in class waiting i new that it would come soon .
these were a few of many obstacles the builders faced the empire state building .
another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future .
such as <organization> word .
<caps> mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends .
<caps> book can be censorship a nasty comment but then again <caps> book can also be censorship the best comments .
also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been with a yellow sticker and its possible that it <month> must be .
it is everyones own choice to read a book or listen to a <location> .
we both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends .
the made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you .
<caps> it got started .
i cant even count the number of times i have been in a complete laughing fit because of <caps> friend <location> .
the apartment was the jail .
after walking around a while this girl talked to me .
another thing is those game websites .
she still has hope of passing the drivers test .
this <caps> not a good way to spend time .
many off the books todays youth read are offensive to older generations .
sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it .
then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for <num> min .
she said i cant have one till <num> moment unless i get a <caps> phone write now and cant till moment to get a real phone .

i do not think that there should be censorship in libraries the empire state building .
not to be mean or anything .
not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human .
i know that laughter made my relationship so much better .
you cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people .
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there .
they knew how dangerous it was .
a mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life .
there can be different censorship on individual people too .
the effects on the computer puts on us can vary .
all my relatives on my dads side were there .
i am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good .
what the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work .

you just sit there staring at a screen .
two years have passed since <person> mom had left .
these things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use .
<caps> only i waited .
it took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures .
so if you need to find a job then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you .
laughter is the most important part when you meet other people .
after the <caps> cousins raises <caps> dad said `` go fishing .
my cousins each go on the computer <num> hours a day .
the slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship .
in every library you wont see that all the books are perfectly good .
people of different religions can sometimes find the print of over there religious books offensive and there is always great controversy about it .
my other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended .
a landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future .
another obstacle the builders faced was the law .
everybody has a different taste in media .
i had changed as person when life when life burned me one to many times .
most are probably so much time on the computer that there not getting enough physical activities .
i looked at the picture laughed and smiled i liked it .

websites such as <caps> and <caps> are also causes of this .
family had cant to do with being blood relative .
it was a great <organization> to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather .

the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation .
libraries have the absolute best resources a place of have or ever wanted .

he needed to be happy .
personally i think computers have a good influence on people .
that is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life .
mooring a dirigible to the top of it .
these all made it much harder to put a mast on the empire state building .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such height .
when we got back my parents were another back .
the author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents .
this quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building .

my family was so thoroughly entertained <caps> my laughter that they could not keep their smiles <caps> laughter removing away without into blankets as bad as mine .
so these are just some of the reasons i think computers could be bad .
its one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous .
there is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all .
censorship should also even exist .
many of the reasons had to do with safety .
authors have just the same right as we do .
i know patients is the key to deer hunting so i will just have to wait .
we decided to meet at my grandmas house .
after three day i missed my school bus .
builders would have to learn new for operating the system at the u .

another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laugh .

are great for kids in libraries .
the modern library has very specific for all items to help it .
the greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety .
my team <caps> the game .
in conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does cant .
so of course i was upset .
we will never have the social our parents i feel if very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose .
most of my friends do it with me .
censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools .

i looked at the teacher and she started busting out laughing .
especially the moments with the ones that <caps> love .
get away from the computer and bond .
